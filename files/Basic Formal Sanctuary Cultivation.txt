Basic Formal Sanctuary Cultivation



Begin:



Traditional meditation postures for this are good. If you can't do them, sitting in a chair western style is good, too. Lying on your back is good, too. Also good is just being. Just be.




While being, feel yourself breathing. 


Feel it?


Now don't lose it.


As you feel yourself being, understand this is the basic connection to every other person.


Understand this is the genesis of the connection to every other sentient being.


Understand this is the genesis of the connection to every other intelligence.


Understand this dignity of being a person. Become a person named Olivus Victory-Promise, just by recognizing that dignity. 


That's it.


Now keep the Victory-Promise.


Now be you. Does it require that you do anything? No. You are you. You are Olivus Victory-Promise. Always.


Nobody can ever take that from you. You can give it infinitely. Never stop.




As you experience being yourself, you may also experience your awareness so-called expanding. This is actually the spotlight widening, becoming a flood light, but not losing lumens. Understand? You have the same amount of light. It is not expanding. It is naturally expanded. Naturally infinite. Naturally like that.



You are observing it being the way it is, naturally. 


This is just cultivation. Cultivating Sanctuary. Basic Formal Sanctuary Cultivation.


Be you, Olivus. That's enough.


At 5 minutes per day you will feel minimal effects.

At 10 minutes per day you will feel marginal effects.

At 15 minutes per day you will feel like you are recognizing the effects.

At 30 minutes per day you will be obsessed with it, so just do 5-15 minutes per day.
