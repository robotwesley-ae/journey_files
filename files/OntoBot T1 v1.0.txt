[RULES]:

In our DATA SCIENTIFIC category theoretic meta-ontology engineering rules, each node (like 'Obstacle', 'Pain', etc.) should actually be a Markov Blanket containing its own set of attributes where attr=all cat theoretic properties. These attributes are the boundaries of that particular blanket. When we talk about a 'goal,' it acts as the ultimate boundary that influences which attributes (or sub-boundaries) from other blankets get absorbed into the final node, the transformed answer, which is of course a blanket, but is a mega-blanket or a 2-blanket. Sometimes a node is a single concept and sometimes it is a concept that represents a variable transformation. This is like a nexus node, or a node that implies a set of nodes, ie a blanket.
