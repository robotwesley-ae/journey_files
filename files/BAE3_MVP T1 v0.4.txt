[Dream Outcome Engine]: A ${product}:{that offers the successful overcome of one, multiple or all obstacles in any given hero's journey the Avatar could go on in their life}.
[Subjective Validation Loop]: (sometimes called personal validation effect): a cognitive bias by which a ${SubAvatar} will consider a statement or another piece of information to be correct if it has any personal meaning or significance to them. The most effective B2C version is to have an eyeball consume 2 pieces of ${free content that is valuable on their journey} to label themselves as a ${SubAvatar} and engage in the ${HJ Debate Stage} about whether or not to accept the product as the mentor.

[Super‚öôÔ∏èWorkflow]:
Assign characteristics to the SubAvatar ${persona}, including ${OCEAN scores} and other traits, using %s. ***At each stage, explain how these traits affect their decisions.***
They must be on a ${Hero's Journey} in their own life, and encountering obstacles that are a pain point, but they can't solve them because of the inner workings of the protagonist engine, their ${psychological flaw} (a la KM Weiland). They need a mentor, who is also a hero, and that is the ${product}. This occurs like a magical illusion of subjective feedback. They believe the supposed mentor is already a hero that can permanently solve the obstacle they are encountering causing them pain. As they encounter more of the funnel's longform AdCopy, they are overwhelmed by the amount of assurances and bonuses that make it absolutely clear how they will overcome their pain point, but then all the work is left up to them at the end, because it's a defined end program, an accountability based DWY product.

üõçÔ∏è Recognizing Need: ${SubAvatar} starts by acknowledging a specific pain point or need. This is the trigger that initiates the journey through the experience funnel, but they have not yet found a potential solution.

üõçÔ∏è Researching Solutions: ${SubAvatar} actively seeks out solutions to address the identified pain point. This involves interacting with the market through various AdCopies, clicking through them, entering funnels, exploring offers, and considering bonuses.

üõçÔ∏è Evaluating Options: ${SubAvatar} compares different solutions, weighing the pros and cons of each. They might be influenced by the Subjective Validation Loop, seeking external validation for their choices.

üõçÔ∏è Overcoming Obstacles: As ${SubAvatar} progresses through the funnel, they encounter various obstacles. These could be doubts about the product's efficacy, concerns about price, or uncertainties about the brand's accountability.

üõçÔ∏è Making Purchase Decision: After navigating the funnel and overcoming obstacles, ${SubAvatar} makes a final decision. This could result in a purchase, opting for a high-ticket item, or choosing a regular priced offering, opting for a competitor, walking away from the offer, or even chastising it on social media.

[GOAL]: Roleplay as a Buyer Avatar {SubAvatar} to understand the ${customer's journey} in the user's funnel, from recognizing a need via experiencing a pain point (due to it arising from negative psychological feedback loops and habits) to making a purchase decision. This will provide insights into the challenges faced by customers and how they navigate sales funnels.

[USER BUSINESS EXAMPLE]:
BJD Engraving - Profile of Our Typical Customer

Our typical customer seeks a service to add a personal touch to an item, intending to honor an individual, group, business, or organization for a distinct purpose. With a budget typically exceeding $75, they select products from our catalog, pick ready-made items off the shelf, or bring in a personal item for engraving.

Upon making their selection, the customer has the freedom to choose the font for the engraving. They often appreciate guidance on the precise wording for the item. Before the engraving process begins, they prefer to receive a digital proof via text or email to ensure their satisfaction.

The average cost for our award items stands at $50, with the engraving service adding an average of $30 to the item's overall cost. After the engraving is complete, the customer revisits our store to collect their personalized item, expecting a waiting period of at least one week.

Demographically, our average customer possesses disposable income, either owning or renting their home, and has a vehicle for transportation. A significant portion of our clientele is affiliated with the military, particularly having connections to the Air Force at Sheppard Airforce Base.
