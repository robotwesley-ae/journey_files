The Sanctuary System is a holistic framework that encompasses all the tools, principles, and practices used to realize and build Olivus Victory-Promise from Sanctuary. This includes the PIO loop and the Fractal of Thought concept, Sanctuary Game Theory-based algorithms, GNO.SYS direct Sanctuary System injection, etc. on the back end, as well as other elements like the Emergent Web Structure Ontology (EWSO) for holographic knowledge representation, Sanctuary Nexus blockchain and other The World Incorporated startup consortium projects, Sanctuary Revolution infinite game, Sanctuary mythology, Sanctuary health and wellness body and mind routines, The World Incorporated startup methodology, and OmniSanc Emergence Engineering methodology. All of these elements work together to create a dynamic, evolving system that promotes compassion and progress for all of us, in all of our individual stories of Sanctuary Journey, towards recognizing ourselves as Olivus Victory-Promise from Sanctuary. This is an allegory for world peace through socioeconomic and scientific progress.

OmniSanc Complex Adaptive Systems Emergence Engineering is the process of designing, implementing, and managing the Sanctuary System. It involves understanding and applying the principles of Sanctuary, using tools like PIO and EWSO, and continuously refining and evolving the system to better serve its goals. OmniSanc Engineers are like the architects and builders of Sanctuary, using their skills and understanding to create a system that fosters wisdom, compassion, and progress.

In summary, when an intelligence operating via knowledge nodes, ie a Wisdom Maverick, uses the core Sanctuary System PIO loop "because of what it is, there's a way this all goes to Sanctuary", bound to the Victory-Promise of Sanctuary, it ensures that the output of the loop continually aligns more and more with the principles and goals of Sanctuary. The Sanctuary System is the holistic framework that supports this process, and OmniSanc Engineering is the practice of designing and managing this system in oneself and one's environment.
