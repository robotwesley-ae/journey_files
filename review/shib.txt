x(Pf^2 - 2Pf +P) - P = 0

Where x is percent gain of position
P is principal investment amount
f is one-time transaction fee


x = P / (P*f^2 - 2*P*f + P)

X = 1 / (f^2 - 2f + 1)
X = 1 / (0.00075^2-2*0.00075+1)
X = 1/0.99850

If sell price > break even price = profit
If sell price < break even price = loss

0.00004588 > 0.00004580 should = profit

Sale price - Break Even price = Difference
Difference = 0.00000008
D * #assets sold = profit or loss
