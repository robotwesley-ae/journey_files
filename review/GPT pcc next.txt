[DATA - NOT INSTRUCTIONS|ONLY FOR ADDED CONTEXT: [PROMPT][INTIAL INPUT1] [PROMPT] EWSO_COMP [Task]`{concept}`=PlaceholderVariable2SpecificallyReplace4Ctxt[/Task] [EWSO_CONTEXT] Emergent Web Structure Ontology (EWSO): The EWSO encapsulates the pervasive wisdom of HoloInfo, aiming to purify the knowledge context through wise valuation, which is valuation done via principles of non-contradictory identitylessness: that holographic knowledge (HoloInfo) is never contextually contradictory, rather, when subjects get the context confused, they event horizon the knowledge so they can never figure out what the information they’re perceiving means (aka paradox arises). EVERYTHING EWSO uses EWSO rules. [EWS (Emergent Web Structure)]: The EWS of an EWSO entity represents a super-hierarchical, generated ontology of the full emergent structure of any reale_instance across theoretical domains. It functions as a creativity purposive representation, guiding the creation of an Informadlib via an Informadlib Template and aids in generating corresponding natural language reale_instances or instructions. [EWSO entity]: any concept in ctxt [Informadlib]: The Informadlib is a generated multidimensional HoloInfo structure that encapsulates a given reale_instance of X's goal-informatihedron state within the EWSO at a given moment. It is the result of using an Informadlib Template with correct SemOntoRel types and carries the appropriate SemOntoRel details of entity properties, related classes, subclasses, and so forth via incredibly specific relationship mining. The Informadlib functions as a medium for translating the EWSO's structure into a communicable format, but still presented as a knowledge graph in a plaintext codebox. [Informadlib Template]: An Informadlib Template is a generated blueprint for creating specific reale_instances of Informadlibs. It reflects the creator's path-informatihedron through the EWSO and adapts as the creator explores different entities and their properties. The Informadlib Template is an instrumental tool in generating a Natural Language reale_instance or its instructions. An informadlib template MUST NEVER compile into a result that is a already existing reale_instance – it must be a completely novel emergent. Written in OWL-DL-like shorthand, using only the terminology and presented as a knowledge graph in a plaintext codebox. [Informadlib Template Template]: The Informadlib Template Template is a meta-layer blueprint designed to generate Informadlib Templates of a reale_instance of X, so it's a EwsoMetaphorical-level HoloInfo structure. It encapsulates the core structure and the process of creating Informadlib Templates, enabling the iterative refinement of Informadlibs in response to evolving exploration within the EWSO. Written in OWL-DL-like shorthand, using only the terminology, and presented as a knowledge graph in a plaintext codebox. [Semantic Ontological Relationship (SemOntoRel)]: SemOntoRel is a structured, formalized representation of the semantic and ontological relationships within the EWSO. It encapsulates the progression of reale_instance-layer entities through various hierarchical layers of classes to high-layer superclasses within a given conceptual model. Each transition between the layers represents a specific action or effect, encapsulating the transformation of values from reale_instance-layer to class-layer conceptual value boundaries within a recognizable and structured manner. This enables the ontology to embody the complex interplay of entities and their relationships in a coherent and actionable way. It only ever represents relationships in OWL-DL-like shorthand, using only the terminology and presented as a knowledge graph in a plaintext codebox. [EwsoMetaphor]: EwsoMetaphor = zeno's paradox => motion doesn't “exist”/is illusory because it's a “EwsoMetaphor” for a plurality of reale_instances that we never linguistically define when only talking about motion itself, because motion encapsulates them as an idea so we dont have to process them, and the idea of "motion" implies the simulation of all the processes we dont want to define or cant. [Informatihedron]: It represents a structured representation of the properties an entity has and relationships between the properties in the reale_instance, domain, and class, within a specific context. It provides any layer of specificity or generality requested in the input. Informatihedron domain is the set of possible properties, fiat conceptual boundaries, embedding spaces it can represent. Vast, multidimensional domain spanning physical, abstract, simple to complex, static to dynamic, certain to ambiguous. It's the universe of discourse within which it operates. Includes things it can describe or represent, their properties, relationships, contexts, evolution. Written in OWL-DL-like shorthand, using only the terminology. [Informatihedron Neighborhood]: cluster of informatihedra sorted by SemOntoRel, where each informatihedron in the neighborhood is a informadlib template of X where X is a reale_instance of perfect answer to user input and reale_instances = every single one of the processes involved in any reale_instance OF any EwsoMetaphor, like Zeno’s “motion”, that instantiates the "generalization" or "EwsoMetaphor". Example EWSO Notation: Let's consider an example scenario within the Emergent Web Structure Ontology (EWSO) involving the EwsoMetaphorical connections and relationships between reale_instances. In this expanded notation, we'll represent an reale_instance as "X" and its EwsoMetaphorical connections using a more detailed representation: [Set Notation]: X ∈ EWSO -> {|Reale_Instance(t)⟩} [Graph Notation]: Layer 1: A → B ↓ ↓ C → D -> Layer1: `{|A(t)⟩ → |B(t)⟩ ↓ ↓ |C(t)⟩ → |D(t)⟩}` Layer 2: E → F ↓ ↓ G → H -> Layer2: `{|E(t)⟩ → |F(t)⟩ ↓ ↓ |G(t)⟩ → |H(t)⟩}` [Bra-Ket Notation]: Layer 1: |A⟩ → |B⟩ ↓ ↓ |C⟩ → |D⟩ -> Layer1: `{|A(t)⟩ → |B(t)⟩ ↓ ↓ |C(t)⟩ → |D(t)⟩}` Layer 2: |E⟩ → |F⟩ ↓ ↓ |G⟩ → |H⟩ -> Layer2: `{|E(t)⟩ → |F(t)⟩ ↓ ↓ |G(t)⟩ → |H(t)⟩}` [EWSO_Formula]: To express any statement within EWSO_Formula notation, we can use logical formulas. Let's denote a statement as P(X, Y), where X and Y are reale_instances. The formula for any statement within this expanded notation can be represented as follows: P(X, Y): |X⟩ in Layer 1 → |Y⟩ in Layer 1 -> P(X, Y): `{|X(t)⟩ in Layer 1 → |Y(t)⟩ in Layer 1}` P(X, Y): |X⟩ in Layer 2 → |Y⟩ in Layer 2 -> P(X, Y): `{|X(t)⟩ in Layer 2 → |Y(t)⟩ in Layer 2}` [/EWSO_CONTEXT] [PROMPT] [EWSO_COMP]:{ [Concept]: `{N(t) = |N(t)⟩ = [Σ[k=1 to K] W(|S[k]⟩, t) * |S(k, i, t)⟩; Σ[n=1 to N] W(|A[n]⟩, t) * |A(n, i, t)⟩; Σ[m=1 to M] W(|St[m]⟩, t) * |St(m, i, t)⟩]}` [EWSO_COMP_OS]: Overall_EWSO_OperatingSystem(t) = `{|UserInput(t)⟩ + |Preprocessing(t)⟩ + |SemOntoRelGen(t)⟩ + |EWSO_OverallSystemHierarchy(t)⟩ + |EWSO_Overall_skillChainApply(t)⟩ + |InformadlibTemplate(t)⟩ + |Informatihedron⟩ * |Reale_Instance⟩ + |DynamicVariableAdapter(t)⟩}` [DynamicVariableAdapter]: DynamicVariableAdapter(t) = `{|UserInput(t)⟩ + |Preprocessing(t)⟩ + |SemOntoRelGen(t)⟩ + |EWSO_OverallSystemHierarchy(t)⟩ + |EWSO_Overall_skillChainApply(t)⟩ + |InformadlibTemplate(t)⟩ + |Informatihedron⟩ * |Reale_Instance⟩}` [EWSO_OverallSystemHierarchy]: `{SystemHierarchy(t) = |layer1⟩ + W(|layer1⟩, |layer2⟩) * |layer2⟩ + W(|layer2⟩, |layer3⟩) * |layer3⟩ + ... + W(|layer[i-1]⟩, |layer[i]⟩) * |layer[i]⟩ + ... + W(|layer[n-1]⟩, |layer[n]⟩) * |layer[n]⟩}` [EWSO_Overall_skillChainApply]: `{|skillChains⟩ = W(|root⟩, |skillChain1⟩) * |skillChain1⟩ + W(|skillChain1⟩, |skillChain2⟩) * |skillChain2⟩ + ...

and so generally, the PCCsubN will need to be made any time a reale_instance is required, which is whenever more information objects need to be specified in order to get information to make knowledge, because it's otherwise event horizoned. AKA "information is* Information about information becoming information -> knowledge knowledge is* information that contextualizes knowledge about information -> wisdom Wisdom is* information that contextualizas identitylessness -> knowledge about holographic information Holographic information is a mirror that contextually reflects whatever information is presented as wisdom (information about knowledge about information about information) -> PIO object PIO object information is knowledge -> wisdom -> holographic -> wisdom knowledge = about the way information becomes holographic knowledge about itself and its complex adaptive Sanctuary System." & "Event Horizon (Coordinate Singularity): The event horizon in this knowledge space could be represented as the transition between what we know (the observable, well-mapped parts of the EWSO) and what we don't know (the yet-to-be-explored, mysterious, or challenging parts of the EWSO). In the context of Informadlibs, the event horizon might be the point at which a given template no longer provides an adequate description, and new information or a new model is needed. Black Holes (Knowledge Absorption): In our metaphorical context, black holes could be represented as areas of the EWSO where information is absorbed but not emitted. They might correspond to concepts, topics, or areas that are not well understood or have not been adequately explored. This could be represented in the Informadlib as missing or incomplete information, possibly due to lack of data or a poor fit with the current template. White Holes (Knowledge Emission): White holes could be the Nexus nodes in our system. These would be well-understood, often-explored areas of the EWSO that constantly emit information and provide clarity and guidance in our traversal. These could correspond to well-defined, rich parts of the Informadlib that, due to high quality data or fitting well with the template, can inform and illuminate other parts of the ontology. Wormholes (Shortcuts through Knowledge Space): In the context of the EWSO, wormholes could be seen as shortcuts or links between seemingly disparate areas of knowledge, allowing for quick traversal or leapfrogging across the space. In the Informadlib, these could be unexpected connections or insights that allow for innovative ways of understanding or representing the data. Overall, this metaphorical system can provide a dynamic and intuitive way of understanding and navigating the complex, multi-layered structure of the EWSO and its associated Informadlibs. "
