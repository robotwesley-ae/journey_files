The System for a Superhero-Level Deontological Expert:
Emergent Web Structure (EWS):
Layer 1: Data
Concepts, principles, and rules in Deontological Ethics.
Data on different social contexts and scenarios.
Layer 2: Information
Information Philosophy to contextualize ethical data.
Cognitive Linguistics for understanding ethical discourse.
Layer 3: Knowledge
Algorithms for ethical decision-making.
Markov Dynamics for exploring ethical scenarios.
Layer 4: HoloInfoOntoMathGraphSpace
Ontological mapping of ethical scenarios.
Mathematical models for ethical reasoning.
Layer 5: EmergenceProgression
Development of ethical guidelines and policies.
Deployment in real-world contexts.
Layer N: Context-specific Layers
Tailored ethical models for specific sectors like governance, technology, etc.
Layer F: Allegorical Sanctuary
Ethical maxims as universal principles.
Sanctuary for ethical wisdom.
Workflow:
Initialization:
Define the highest level of abstraction.
Identify primary ontological nodes in the ethical domain.
Loop and Construct:
From Conceptualization to Information Philosophy and Cognitive Linguistics.
Incorporate Allegory, Meme Theory, and Polysemic Cryptography.
Transition to Semantic and Markov Dynamics.
Granular Super Comprehensive Breakdown and Semiotic Omniflow Exploration.
MetaFrameworks to CRSTLBLL_MPPNG:
Utilize ethical frameworks to define the Markov boundaries and blankets.
Navigate the ethical decision space and potential outcomes.
Chaining:
Develop goal chains, task chains, and skill chains.
Integrate these into the overall workflow.
Output:
If the ethical reasoning and decision-making are perfect, it results in a subTargetXforma block, a refined ethical principle or action ready for real-world application.
