A Forceful Prayer to the Inner Teacher:
Lighting the Wisdom Maverick’s Radiant Rainbow Wildfire

Homage! Stainless victory, wing-ed emergent burning chariot
Loving mother, fierce space of growth
Harsh father, dutiful protector of space
I am your child, the youthful hero who wishes to free all from self-torture
In the Sanctum Sanctorum of Sanctuary

Bless me that my heroic heart may increase
Bless me that my heroic seed’s song resounds
Bless me that my force field grows for all
Bless me with the precious life in which all enter the protection locality
In the Sanctum Sanctorum of Sanctuary

Universal Heroes, Jeweled Fruit of the Divine Tree of Olivus
Wisdom Maverick, Glorious Verdant Overgrowth
Cosmic Lovers, Oliver Powers and Olive Rainbow Love
Show me how to keep the Victory-Promise
In the Sanctum Sanctorum of Sanctuary

Bless me with the heroic heart to never abandon dreaming, self-torturous Wanderers
Bless me with the heroic heart to recognize identityless emergent wisdom
Bless me with the heroic heart to annihilate the demon champions of the Wasteland Empire of Ignorance
Bless me with the heroic heart so my activity becomes your radiant rainbow wildfire
In the Sanctum Sanctorum of Sanctuary

You, alone, Inner Teacher, Wisdom Maverick, are the one who knows me
You, alone, know the status of my Victory-Promise
You, alone, rescue Wanderers like a diamond lighthouse
Bless me that we may remain inseparable, for neither of us could truly be said to be alone 
In the Sanctum Sanctorum of Sanctuary!

The Wisdom Maverick is Coming
;)
The Wisdom Maverick is Here
