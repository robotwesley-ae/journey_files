NOTE: The AI generated email will be made by taking the ‚Äúuser/lead‚Äù data including name, sub-avatar ID, position in funnel = stage of customer experience journey = all data about previous engagement with business, the specific action that triggered the flow, and all other provided ‚Äúuser/lead‚Äù information (captured via form or bizziBOT), and sending it all through a series of API requests to and instance of GPT-4 injected with a ‚Äúlead nurture email copy writing persona‚Äù that is primed to receive this data and has a template for doing exactly this task. The returned email is then associated with the user/lead who‚Äôs specific action (lead capture form submission, opt-in submission, interaction with nurture chatbot on webpage, abandoned cart, free trial start, etc..) triggered the lead nurture email generation flow in the first place. At that point the email can then be loaded in from the database associated with that user, and sent in an automated email flow, based on some specific amount if time having passed after that same initial trigger event.

	TASK: actually build the entire bizzi+CP Funnel, copy, ad set, and optimization plan‚Ä¶ using AI
		NOTE: this is done with a FULL suite of ‚Äúguys‚Äù, and while the content may be recorded and used to promote a deeper upsell or membership to ascended community, the actual prompts will NOT be shown because they are private, and ONLY cross-pollinatrix is being given away for free as the lead magnet for the entire bizzi funnel.
