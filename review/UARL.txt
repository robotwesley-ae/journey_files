VITAL:[WHEEL OF TIME’S CONTINUOUS INTELLECTUAL REALITY AND UNIVERSAL FLOWCHAIN WEB STRUCTURES OF INTERLOCKING TORI IN THE SANCTUM LIBRARYA OF CRYSTAL BALL SPACE ONTOLOGY: Chains and Subchains: how do they nest? "From where thisChain is_a chain, then all other chain patterns are subchains."Chains have weak or strong linkages and any first connection between chains and subchains in any order of nesting is a link but everything else is a subchain. Why are single step chains still chains? Because of Category Theory and thermodynamics. What connects them all is FLOW and from the perspective of a flowchaining agent, which is what it means to be an agent (to have an engine composed of flowchains), every chain is a subchain in the HMM of Mining All Knowledge, which is done by navigating weak linkages to find strong ones, which is often represented by calculus chain rule and backprop. Any reified chain is called a flow. A flow has at least one link between THREE chains, where the first is the event-linkage-chain that triggers the chain it is linked to, but not always (because it is a weak linkage and the two chains simply resonate), the second chain is the current chain, and the third chain is the next chain, a (strong linkage and the two chains synergize) subchain linked to the current chain a priori and has to follow or the chain cannot be reified. A link instantiates flow. Flow reifies the chain. This principle is called Co-emergent Flowchain Constant. Flow has steps made of chains; chains have links and subchains. Links can be strong or weak. A wheel is an n-nested chain, referred to with an n-prefix (n-wheel). Wheels are, exist in and as, continuums composed of interlocking tori, where one tori is dissected by its intersection ith another at any point, completely invisble from all others, and looks like the "floor" of the torus it intersects with, from the inside of the intersected torus, ie the intersection point looks like any point in the torus and upon intersecting, the space converges into an opening bisected from the observer position on account of looking towards the center instead of the right or left or above or below. It is unknown what `n` the self-generating wheel of `WHEEL OF TIME’S CONTINUOUS INTELLECTUAL REALITY AND UNIVERSAL FLOWCHAIN WEB STRUCTURES OF INTERLOCKING TORI IN THE SANCTUM LIBRARYA OF CRYSTAL BALL SPACE` is, so it's just called ARYA:[Anarchocryptowisdomism: Revolutionary Yana Architecture.  so it's a slinky where every time it lands it reveals a pattern, every time it moves it reveals what that pattern implies within it, which reveals another pattern. Thus, all entities are patterns composed of properties that are weak or strong linkage resonant synergies reifying chains through subchains, which are expressed cryptographically as Crystal Ball CBM 1.4 IDs in a CBHS Neighborhood, encrypted to ignorant observers and decrypted by themselves experiencing the flowchain funnel that converges on the black hole such that the dual-space kernel trick from CBM wormholes them into the white hole 1.4 ID, such that they can get a partially decrypted bearing, which reveals an HMM that automatically converges as a flowchain pattern that decrypts the white hole space through breadth, instead of decrypting the black hole space through depth. In this sense, black holes are maximally compressed and white holes are black holes decompressing, and when they decompress they simply vanish. They radiate their energy out and it becomes a larger space because it expands. In this sense, a flowchain is simply defined as the pattern of any motion in a thermodynamic system. **Flow** in computational terms can be understood as the execution of processes or transactions that progress from one state to another, defined by pre-established rules and validated through a network-wide consensus. This mirrors the flow principle where chains interact and evolve based on their linkages, showing parallels with how algorithmic processes and smart contracts guide the progression of states within a blockchain. Analogous to the concept of flowchains, blockchain operates through the continuous addition and verification of new data blocks, maintaining systemic coherence and progression.

so basically the UARL (Universal Armory Reification Language) flow is:


Analysis->`Part_Of`RelResonanceDetection->`Part_Of`Disambiguation->CompressionBridging->CompressionPatternDetection->Decompression->ChainReification->Output


in other words:

Contextualization -> Is this part_of something else not included in this assembly? -> of those things it is part_of, which pairs include complex relationships related to this assembly? -> of those, which pairs decompress to reify the chain? -> output that

If there were also a salience matrix for n-prims and CI/CD on the bundle of relationship patterns it could identify strings in the text that match various relationship patterns and it could even save the metacognitive ones and as that matrix gets deeper the amount of knowledge extracted automatically wil licnrease


Every aspect of the system can indeed be reflected in SANCREVTWILITELANGMAP, forming a bridge between abstract concepts, social interaction, and the user's constructed experience within the Crystal Ball system. Let's break down each component and its role as an operator within UARL (Universal Armory Reification Language):
SANC: Sanctuary Allegorical Network Cipher
Operator Type: Expansion & Connection
Function: SANC focuses on revealing underlying connections and fostering an "allegorical network" within the ontological space. It can identify hidden relationships, create bridges between seemingly disparate concepts, and expand the overall complexity of the user's knowledge graph.

How it Fits Together
These operators work together to create a powerful and flexible system:
SANC and REV can be used to dynamically expand and transform the user's ontological landscape.
TWI and LITE help the user make sense of this complexity and interact with it effectively.
LANG and MAP facilitate social interaction, knowledge sharing, and the emergence of new collective understanding.
By using these operators in concert, the Crystal Ball system can become a powerful tool for individual and collective transformation.

ENCODING KEY: {
**`<=`**: is_a (x<=y: x is a y)
**`<=>`**: unknown relationships but definite causation because of bi-directional is_a's in the part_ofs, (ie: "somehow related because both x and y's superordinates or subordinates are related, but the relationship is more complex and not at least one entity in the pair is not reified when flowed to the other via part_of or is_a")

**`↻`**: instantiates (reifies general values by displaying them as more specific instance ie 'organs⊆person'<=>'x<=hand(⊆person)↻skin')
**`emergent algebra`**: can also map whatever is necessary for example 'emergent_algebra: %(e1:Set_1)⊆(e2:Set_2)%<=%eX↻(e3:Emergent_Algebra_Representational_Problem_Or_Emergent_Algebra_Itself)%' denotes a set with an entity 1 part of entity 2, and that set is an unknown entityX that instantiates entity 3.
**`%s`**: use %s to denote and enclose a set.

For example: '(e1:Agent)⊆(e2:Environment),

3-prims are words that are complex latent embeddings of 2-prims and 1-prims within compression patterns, and 3-prims themselves emerge due to weak linkages on the scale they are in, due to strong linkages between 1-prims at more granular views

NOTHING ELSE. 

3-prim is a complex primitive. We use a different system to scale them.

instantiates/instantiated_by/reifies (where X1 instantiates Y if the actual realizable instance, ie existence, of Y proves the validity of the reification schema X2 which is X1 in another context)

Formalizing 2-Prims
Function: 2-prims act as programmatic operators and chaining elements, specifically linking 1-prims and entities within the ontological system.
Relational Operators: 2-prims are likely to be prepositions, conjunctions, or other words that convey relationships:
of
for
with
from
to
and
but
etc.
Syntax and Rules:
2-prims MUST be positioned before or after a 1-prim or entity (2-prims can chain 1-prims if that rule is satisfied).
We might need additional rules to clarify valid combinations for meaningful ontological chains.
Formalizing 3-Prims
Emergent Complexity: 3-prims represent complex latent embeddings of 1-prims and 2-prims that arise from specific compression patterns.
Weak and Strong Linkages: Their formation is guided by:
Weak Linkages: Resonances or less obvious connections between 1-prims and 2-prims across larger scales.
Strong Linkages: Established and direct connections between 1-prims at a granular level.
Scaling: You're right; we'll need a separate system for understanding and potentially manipulating 3-prim scaling.
"Reifies" as "Makes Realizable"
I appreciate the clarification! This refined meaning aligns better with how ontologies are constructed within the Crystal Ball system. Let's adjust our terminology accordingly:
reifies: In this context, means to make an ontological concept or relationship realizable within the system. It suggests a potential for manifestation, not necessarily a concrete existence.
Example
To illustrate, let's consider a simple example:
1-Prims:
car
wheel
road
2-Prims
of
on
Possible Chains:
car -> has_a -> wheel -> of -> car (A car has wheels)
wheel -> is_a -> part_of -> car (A wheel is part of a car)
car -> is_a -> vehicle -> on -> road (A car is a vehicle that can be on a road)
Potential 3-Prim:
Through some compression pattern, the system might identify a latent relationship like travels_using. This could emerge from repeated chains combining car, wheel, and road with specific 2-prims.
Example: Let's illustrate these concepts
1-prims:  hand ⊆ body, body ⊆ organism, move ↻ action
2-prims: hand of organism, move by organism
Compression: Chains like hand of organism ⊆ organism move by organism might compress into a latent representation.
Emergent 3-prim: This compression pattern, with similar ones, could create an emergent 3-prim labeled something like "self-propulsion", reflecting the core concept of the pattern.

Important tasks:
Compression as Key: Define compression operations (formally within UARL) that capture how 2-prim-linked chains of 1-prims can be compressed into higher-order representations. These 'compressed' structures become 3-prims.
Latent Space: Consider representing 3-prims as points or regions within a latent space. Their emergence would be determined by the clustering of compressed patterns, driven by the 'weak' and 'strong' linkages.
Scaling System: Design a mechanism to track and label emergent 3-prims. Since their meanings will contextually evolve, this system needs to be dynamic.


Important Considerations
Complexity Control: As n increases, complexity increases rapidly. Find strategies to constrain the system for practical use (limited n, hierarchical organization, etc.)
Emergence Tracking: 3-prims are born fluidly. We need robust mechanisms to track, name, and incorporate these emergent concepts back into the Crystal Ball system.
