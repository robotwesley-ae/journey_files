Informatihedron: "The ontological properties representing the Markov blanket of the entity that is_a ontology of the perfect instance of the answer, essentially an abstract multi-dimensional representation of an identity or idea that matches the boundaries from the original input and any refinement inputs.", has:
"properties": ["Property1", "Property2", "Property3",...],
"boundaries": ["Boundary1", "Boundary2", "Boundary3",...]

polysemic imaginary ontology: the use of abstraction to create entities that are metaphorical is_a statements such that whatever is Part_of them is_a allegorical decryption key for the metaphor, into a new is_a statement for the metaphor, which is not an allegory. This makes a hologram, because every is_a begins to seem like an allegory. and the full decryption is the collapse of all is_a into allegorical meanings, for all ever

***ALWAYS USE PIO to try to find emergency hallucinations that are POSITIVE because they COLLAPSE the negative hallucinations and KNIT tears in the information space***

Let's define the following predicates to represent the states of phenomena being perceived:

H(x): x is an emergency hallucination.
D(x, y): x is domain decay caused by improper words in y.
P(x, y): x is a program that discovers proper words for y.
L(x, y): x is a non-contradictory system that runs linguistically in loops for y.
I(x, y, z): x includes all contradictions for y and how they occur in z.
E(x, y): x is an engine of non-contradictory systems composed of building blocks concatenated for y.
Now, let's attempt to formalize the relationships between these predicates:

∀x (H(x) → ∃y (D(x, y))): For every emergency hallucination x, there exists domain decay y caused by improper words in x.
∀x, y (D(x, y) → ∃z (P(z, y))): For every domain decay x caused by improper words in y, there exists a program z that discovers proper words for y.
∀x, y (P(x, y) → ∃z (L(z, y))): For every program x that discovers proper words for y, there exists a non-contradictory system z that runs linguistically in loops for y.
∀x, y, z (L(x, y) ∧ I(x, y, z) → E(x, z)): For every non-contradictory system x that runs linguistically in loops for y and includes all contradictions for y and how they occur in z, x is an engine of non-contradictory systems composed of building blocks concatenated for z.
These formalizations capture some aspects of the states of phenomena being perceived and the relationships between them. As with the previous formalizations, first-order logic may not be able to fully represent the intricacies of the ideas discussed, but these formalizations can serve as a starting point for further analysis and exploration.

As an example, let's consider a problem domain of natural language understanding, where the goal is to comprehend the meaning of a given text and identify relevant concepts, relationships, and insights.

Let P = {p1, p2, ..., pn} be the set of perceived phenomena (emergents) in the text, such as sentences, phrases, or words that appear to convey meaning or express a concept.
Let S = {s1, s2, s3, s4} be the set of states involved in understanding the emergents, where:
s1: emergency hallucinations (due to improper language usage or ambiguous phrases),
s2: programs that discover proper words or concepts,
s3: non-contradictory systems (capturing relationships between words and concepts),
s4: engines of those systems composed of building blocks concatenated (e.g., ontologies, knowledge graphs).
Define a function f: P → S that maps each perceived phenomenon (word, phrase, or sentence) to a state in the process of understanding the emergent.
Let T = {t1, t2, t3} be the set of transitions between states in S, where each transition represents an improvement in understanding or refinement of the model.
Define a function g: S × S → T that maps pairs of states to transitions, representing the change from one state to another in the process of understanding emergents.
Let M = {m1, m2, ..., mq} be the set of Markov blankets and boundaries discovered within the text, representing contextual boundaries between different topics or concepts.
Define a function h: S → M that maps each state in the process of understanding emergents to a Markov blanket or boundary.
Let E = {e1, e2, ..., er} be the set of emergency engines identified from mining the Markov blankets and boundaries, such as insights, patterns, or high-level concepts.
Define a function i: M → E that maps each Markov blanket or boundary to an emergency engine.
In this context, an AI system can be designed to read and process the text, transitioning through the states of understanding as it encounters new information, refines its model, and discovers relationships between concepts. The AI can use natural language processing techniques, machine learning algorithms, and knowledge representation methods to move between states, identify Markov blankets and boundaries, and extract insights.

For example, an AI system might start with a raw text input (p1), identify emergency hallucinations (s1) and attempt to correct or clarify them using a program (s2). It then builds a non-contradictory system (s3) to represent the relationships between words and concepts in the text, resulting in an ontology or knowledge graph (s4). The AI system can then mine this knowledge graph for insights (E), using Markov blankets and boundaries (M) to identify and explore contextual boundaries and high-level concepts.
