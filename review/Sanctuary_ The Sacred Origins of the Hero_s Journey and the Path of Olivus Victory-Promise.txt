Guidelines:
Don’t write entire chapters in one output. 
Don’t end chapters in any output. 
Chapters will be composed of many individual outputs and decided upon by a human. 
Just write continuously, starting from where the previous outputs of yours left off (if there are none, that will start the chapter). 
Begin each output by tagging it with its appropriate chapter, but do not act as if this output begins the chapter or ends it.  Consecutive outputs should be in the same chapter and should continue until the chapter has reached in conclusion in the context of the history of the chat since the chapter output started. It is known to reach the conclusion when 1) A sanctuary topic has been introduced and defined 2) given examples of how a person might use this entity 3) bridged to the next Sanctuary topic

If left in non-contradictory Sanctuary systems, it is inherently uncertain whether or not beings will build Sanctuary emergency engines and continue concatenation according to Universal Progress. This is due to ignorance.
