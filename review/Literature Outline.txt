Intro
What is information? An inference constructing difference
What is an idea? A known inference constructed difference
What is the relationship between ideas and information? Information exists a priori and becomes known through a subject

What is IP? Some kind of 
What is the problem with information?
IKI, PWKI, WKI


Assign all the below into IKI, PWKI, WKI categories

What we know is associative but it is difficult to know which knowledge you possess and what its associates are in the information space
Because what we know is largely unstructured
And not every type of information is formalized
Therefore, not machine readable
Therefore, instruction sets can be made but your own human understanding of X cannot be simulated in a neural net (NNs only generate ad hoc formalism from training data, IKI)
So when you have an idea, the knowledge needed to realize it cannot be quickly mined
Requires multiple people
Requires organization, effective communication
Effective communication only possible with formalism
So many ideas can only be realized by certain organizations of people
Not democratic

NOTE: Inferred information is superpositioned. Collapsed with CB

Intro p2: How do people currently manipulate data and generate realizables?
Ontologies: formalize information (BFO, OWL, etc…)
Graph Databases: intuitively store related information (entity oriented) (neo4j)
Visualization: intuitively understand stored related information
Neural Nets: mechanically arrange contextual information according to intent
Data Science, Knowledge Engineering (rapidminer)
Generative AI (GPT3)
All of this requires expertise
Expertise requires understanding
Requires time
Requires conditions of freedom
Has real world requirements
Slows growth and progress

But… what if expertise/understanding is democratized?

[images: Process Tree sequential diagrams (arrows), Informatihedron and neighborhood (Rhino+arrows)]
The new solution: intuitive cross-domain search that sculpts realizable objects from concept parameters
Data input into database (data collection and classification)
Core Identity Traits
Search input (agent) -> 
Data retrieval (database) -> 
Result visualization -> 
Informatihedron selected for Heaviest Weighted Realizable
Property Spectrum Visualization of Bounded k-NN ->
Informatihedron Neighborhood
Result manipulation (tuning parameters, assisted by graph embeddings = neighborhood warp)
This is information time travel 

Middle p2: USE CASES [Images: use Infographics]
1) Engineering - generative AI already does this, but not with a visual search
Dreamcatcher vs Crystal Ball -> architectural use case

2) Artistic Use - formalization of art object theory -> GenAI does not
Definition of Artistic Style (Ontology)
Definition of Avant-Garde (Ontology, Neighborhood Boundary, Domain Mining)
ScreenwritingAIs vs Crystal Ball -> screenplay use case

3) Research - theory rule engineering -> GenAI does not
Crystal Ball vs Classifier Algorithms -> ontology building use case

4) Business
product feature engineering -> GenAI does but requires expertise
GAMMA vs Crystal Ball
Article property mining -> attaching NLP to domains like marketing for puff pieces 
GPT3 vs Crystal Ball -> puff piece use case

5) Personal - cooking -> GenAI does quite poorly and only with instruction sets
Yummly vs Crystal Ball -> pasta carbonara use case

End: Phase 1 Funding and Traction
Hiring a team 
Engineers to build v1.0
GrandSTACK Dev Team + Knowledge Engineers
Release v1.0 -> CB dataset omnitool and single domain and subdomains use (democratizes screenwriting, cooking, whatever)
Sales -> for individuals working with said domain data
TAM, SAM, SOM
Value -> Information Real Estate -> 
Domain neighborhood lock (we own/rent the ability to use certain domains generatively)
TAM, SAM, SOM
realizable IP neighborhood lock (we own/rent all realizables IP in given domain, subdomain)
TAM, SAM, SOM
Crowdsourcing ontological datasets 
Bounty offers
Network effect

Phase 2: Expansion

2A) 
Engineers R&D to build/apply NN to Omnitool for automated domain construction, mining (domain-NN property spectrum extractor)
Sales -> library of purchasable IP for users (we charge flat % based on potential bounty value for lock and also take % total when IP mined by users is sold)
Application of Blockchain public ledger for IP ownership
Research & Development -> partnering with research institutions to construct high impact domains and subdomains
Give authorship 
% IP for CB applies
2B) 
B2B -> flat rate enterprise licensing to businesses based on operations value
We consult with you to build your business’ domain ontology and you mine it or pay us % to mine it for you
for operations management (efficiency)
human capital management (hiring/role transition/firing)
Hiring data links with applicant/available pool data
Hiring property spectrums (skills) cross references w applicants/available pool and maximizes matching efficiency
supply chain management (contingency simulation)
product feature engineering, product pivoting 

Phase 3: Further expansion
Blockchain to manage global IP ownership
