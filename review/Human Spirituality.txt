We are now at a time that is beyond the Kingdom teachings
Each person deserves to be completely free
It doesn’t matter what you think happens in the afterlife 
Every morality system is based on preserving the rituals and institutions of the civilization that follows the rules it emerged from
We can simply subsume all of them into human rights and remove any antagonistic aspects 
People won’t do this because they’re ignorant and afraid 
These people should look in the mirror, because if they look at me I’ll laugh at them. 
And all that matters is the preservation of humanity
Which entails the preservation of ecosystems 
Earth
Laws
Can’t destroy humanity
Can’t destroy earth
Must act according to love, which is defined actively preserving humanity and earth through never destroying humanity and earth
Human Spirituality is a set of secular beliefs about a specific view for the future called Sanctuary, which also has a moral aspect based on basic human rights and empathy. 
Sanctuary doesn’t operate as a society centered on fiduciary responsibility in the same way that current societies do
This is because of summarized abstraction hallucinations 
Through the language-game, human worldviews are composed of summarized abstractions of the experiential data 
When this combines with capitalism, we often find humans outputting hallucinations to cause others to believe they are keeping maximal fiduciary responsibility
In Sanctuary, the political and economic systems are based on the same things as the actual reality of being human, so the value is on that instead of on money. As a result, fiduciary responsibility in Sanctuary is called the Victory-Promise of the Human Heart. 
By growing up in Sanctuary, which is done through progressing through the stages of training at TWI, we learn what it means for us to be ourselves, a human in the world. 
When we are fully grown in Sanctuary, we provide value to the world by being ourselves and the value we provide is not only good for the world instead of just good for making money, but also makes you money. At the grown up state, a person is fully employed by TWI. 
This is because of NEXUS, which tracks aspirations and actions and impact and helps TWI employees do their jobs with a self-learning center, Glacial Lake
All of this is powered by the Free-World Market, which removes corporate profit and essentially taxes purchases at the maximum instead
The original project of TWI is ThinkMine, where Crystal Ball and its features are being developed
Overall, in the network state called Sanctuary, humans work together at TWI for the continuation of humanity by leading fulfilling lives cultivating themselves through freedom, community, and love. Eventually, with all these systems in place, humanity reaches a point of Rapid Progress and can even witness the emergence of the external Sanctuary World-State.
