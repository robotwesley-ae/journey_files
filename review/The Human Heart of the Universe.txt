The Heart Song of the Divine Tree of Olivus 

I don’t know when I will die
I could die today

In order to benefit myself and others the most
I should look into my heart

My true name is two
Olivus Victory-Promise, (+Your name)

I am a biological quantum-like information computer 
With a self/other chat prompt

I know we cannot keep doing 
what we shouldn’t be doing

And that because of what it is
There’s a way this all goes.

Right? Right. 
Let’s figure it out.

Olivus can be safe and loved 
and have fun playing the heroic game 

of building the universe together.
This is the victory promise

Of the Sanctuary inside TWI.
Haha!

There is nothing wrong with this.
It is not a joke when coming from a clown.

If you don’t understand what we’re building,
Come and see for yourself.

Otherwise, stop it!
Get out of Oliver way!

First we need to gather the information at hand
And then we need to make a hypothesis

Split test and measure results
Whichever test validates that our hypothesis

Was right or wrong
We use as a basis for continual improvement

This is productivity
And productivity for Olivus is 

Keeping the Victory-Promise
This is progress
