Welcome to SANCTUARY REVOLUTION


In this Sanctuary that looks like a Wasteland pretending to be a Sanctuary, 

You bring ourselves online. 

And 

You find yourself in nightmare mode. 

You have no empowered victory-promise. You have no DET, so that means you have high debt and  no job. 
You have been offered the position of Co-Founder in TWI THE WIRKD INCORPORATED, but you’ll start with 0.001% equity and the cliff only kicks in when:


You understand that even though it may look like you are being told about things other people are going to do, they’re never going to do them. If you want the vision to come true, you have to do it yourself, which means it’ll have your own spin mixed in, which means you have to purify it to integrate with SANC.
