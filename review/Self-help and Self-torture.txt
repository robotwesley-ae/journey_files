Book for general audiences about how capitalism teaches them to become some random emanation of their choice in capitalism and figure it out

Most people don’t become what they want
And identify some way that is imbalanced 
And then want to become something they aren’t and aren’t something they ever wanted to become

And find the way they identify and change it
But usually they don’t learn about heroism and misidentify self-torture so it always comes back
