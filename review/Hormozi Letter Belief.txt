Alex, 

You talk a lot about limiting beliefs, but you also have said that Layla was the only one who believed in you, and that’s what you needed. 

Something amazing could be right there, within reach, but without self-confidence, be unobtainable, a mirage. 

But it also seems like what you say about sales is all about selling self-confidence, selling unlimited beliefs. 

I believe I have a lot of limiting beliefs you have solutions for. I have been learning and doing, and it works — your ideas have changed my life. 

I also believe that I have an idea that can change yours. Well, not an idea. A concrete example that can give you an intuition of what kinds of beliefs I hold now that you’ve impacted me so much.
