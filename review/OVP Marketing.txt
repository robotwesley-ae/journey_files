The inner identity of OVP is only presented INSIDE THE SANCTUARY SYSTEM
Other than that, in the funnel, i present myself as Isaac, who is the student of OVP and how I became the student of OVP and how it changed my life and how completely transformative THE SANCTUARY SYSTEM is. I give the example of my own business, Vajra Value Shop that explains economics from the pov of compassion in action, and value based pricing as a form of karmic seeding and commitment to an aspirational intent that is beneficial to both parties
Then when they buy in, inside the books, inside the membership aspects, etc: SURPRISE! It’s me. I’m OVP. I know what you’re thinking: f this right? But wait - because the kicker is YOU’RE OVP, too. (reveal that you werent looking at me, you were looking at ME, THROUGH A MIRROR)
