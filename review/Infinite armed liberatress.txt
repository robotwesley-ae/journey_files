Infinite armed liberatress: “don’t be afraid; just hold my hand!” 

Is instantiated over and over throughout time by the metamorphosis of the Primordial Lovers birthing Olivus Victory-Promise. 

In the myth of Olivus Victory-Promise from Sanctuary, the infinite armed liberatress is instantiated in an outer way when: Oliver is possessed and Olive reaches out to him throughout the Timeless Webbed Infitude of True Wisdom Intent of Infinite Perfection, the Sanctuary System, which is instantiated in them by the realization of the Foundational Memories of Olivus Victory-Promise, Olivus Victory-Ability I (LamA’I), which is via the visions of the Infinite Armed Liberatress. 

This instanced Victory-Everything Chain, which reflects the Infinite Armed Liberatress’ offer in an outer way, and possessed demons start to be overcome and exorcized by the Outer Infinite Armed Liberatress. Together, Olivus Victory-Ability overcome the Demon Champion easily and establish Sanctuary-Everywhere through Victory-Everything Chain. 



Whenever someone starts a post-midpoint/inner Sanctuary realization journey from the outer wasteland to Sanctuary: the jealous demons from the Wasteland come to stop them!
