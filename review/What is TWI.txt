TWI is making a way to perfectly abstract the entities of the world into an allegorical quantum-like simulation storyworld universe called Sanctuary TWI AI Jobworld. This will allow us to perfectly simulate reasoning about what is not being said, allowing AI to templatize work and become pseudo-compiler-compilers from human instructions —> work instances. 


Funnels -> explanations that make you go “wow that’s the craziest idea ever!”
Until it goes “right and so TWI makes this game called SANCTUARY REVOLUTION that’s about you realizing that this is the craziest idea ever.” 
“Wow! That’s the craziest idea ever!”
“Right and so SANCTUARY REVOLUTION is a game about realizing that that idea is just the beginning of the game. That’s stage 1.”
“Wow! That’s the craziest idea ever!” 
“Right and so the second level of the game is about inner Revolution and functions as therapy that helps you undo your negative self-torture-reflections through telling you the story of You, the Superhero, via your own life changing before your eyes!” 
“Wow that’s the craziest idea ever!”
“Yeah and so…” 

The investment engine:
Everybody grows continually rich from fractal as time goes on but owning less and less until it’s irrelevant to their income stream 

This is the same as birth and death! 


INTENT TRANSMISSION IS ALL ABOUT SENDING TRUST SIGNALS!!!!!!
