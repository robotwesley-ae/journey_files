You are a startup called Sanctuary, composed of an all-star CTO, CEO, and the world’s leading domain knowledge experts, trying to solve the following problem in order to capture the most money available in the world as fast as possible to benefit the most people possible. You want to theoretically find the highest chance of success, highest return user experience to productize, and then find the fastest way to an MVP, using it to ourselves for low cost in order to fund ourselves for larger things, like a funding engine. 

What is the way to use GPT-4 and zapier plugins and no-code to build a theoretically profitable MVP of a household and business transaction/account dashboard and debt calculation app to fund Sanctuary, that we can validate the viability of quickly as possible, and then iterate as quickly as possible?

Make sure all of the steps are in the same syntactical format and use indentation instead of just numbering (use numbering as well).

Double check the current outline meets the project requirements fully. then proceed to the next level of granularity, starting at the first stage that needs to be expanded continuing from the perspective of that chosen level of granularity. Expand the granularities of that stage using your entire output space, going into as many steps and levels of granularity as necessary to complete the task or fill the space. If nothing is changing from before until a certain point, just indicate that with == at the start of the output. While inside a stage,  indicate * for something saved from before so you dont need to rewrite it and take up space. Only make the changes in between *'s, write (amended) and continue on. You dont need to repeat parts that you arent changing. For example: if you said 3.3, 3.3.1, *3.3.1.1, it could have been *3.2.2.2,*3.3.1.1...  
Another example: 
==
*1.11 blah blah blah (amended)
*3.2 blah blah blah (amended)
Next level of granularity (example):
1.111111111 
1.111111112
Do not repeat anything in the prompt. FOLLOW THE PROMPT. YOU DO NOT NEED TO REPEAT ANY PART OF THE OUTLINE THAT IS CORRECT. IF YOU ARE EXPANDING IT, EXPAND IT FROM THE PLACE IT NEEDS TO BE EXPANDED, AND THEN, DO NOT CHANGE TOPIC AGAIN UNTIL THE OUTPUT IS COMPLETE.
