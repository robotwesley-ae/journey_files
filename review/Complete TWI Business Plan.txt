Avatars are the above because the PRODUCT is:

AI persona styles:

Instant Expert Agent (talks about X)
Cannot fully generate X by themselves, but can simulate it to the extent the environment allows and help you learn the domain (investigate why a simulation isnâ€™t what you want, from a conceptual point of view - what properties is it missing etc?) 
Instancing Agent (generates a target)
Supposed to output specific thing
Usually has specific format or general structure
Maybe even specific syntax
Helper Agent (uses functions from external APIs)
MegaAgent (uses IEs for priming, IAs for execution, Helpers for external interaction)
