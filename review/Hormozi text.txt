Step #1: Identify Dream Outcome I had heard of weight loss challenges, so I started there. Lose 20lbs in 6 weeks. Big dream outcome - lose 20lbs. With a decreased time delay - 6 weeks. Note: I wasn't selling my membership anymore. I wasn’t selling the plane flight. I was selling the vacation. When you are thinking about your dream outcome, it has to be them arriving at their destination and what they would like to experience. 
Step #2: List Problems Next, I wrote down all the things people struggled with and their limiting thoughts around them. When listing out problems, think about what happens immediately before and immediately after someone uses your product/service. What's the “next” thing they need help with? These are all the problems. Think about it in insane detail. If you do, you will create a more valuable and compelling offer as you’ll continually be answering people’s next problem as it manifests.. So, let’s go ahead and list out the problems from a prospect’s perspective as you think about them. What points of friction exist for them? I like to think in the sequence that the customer will experience each of these obstacles. Again, channel insane detail (the more problems the better!). Example Problem List: Weight Loss First thing they must do: Buying healthy food, grocery shopping Buying healthy food is hard, confusing, and I won’t like it Buying healthy food will take too much time Buying healthy food is expensive I will not be able to cook healthy food forever. My family’s needs will get in my way. If I travel I won’t know what to get. Next thing they must do: Cooking healthy food Cooking healthy food is hard and confusing. I won’t like it, and I will suck at it. Cooking healthy food will take too much time Cooking healthy food is expensive. It’s not worth it. I will not be able to buy healthy food forever. My family’s needs will get in my way. If I travel I won’t know how to cook healthy. Next thing they must do: Eating healthy food 1) Etc... Next thing they must do: Exercise Regularly 1) Etc... Now we’re gonna go full circle here. Each of the above problems has four negative elements. And you guessed it, each aligns with the four value drivers as well. Dream Outcome→ This will not be financially worth it Likelihood of Achievement→ It won’t work for me specifically. I won't be able to stick with it. External factors will get in my way. (This is the most unique and service-specific of the problem buckets). Effort & Sacrifice→ This will be too hard, confusing. I won’t like it. I will suck at it. Time→ This will take too much time to do. I am too busy to do this. It will take too long to work. It won’t be convenient for me. Now, go ahead and list out all the problems your prospect has. Don’t let these buckets, which are just meant to get your brain going, constrain you. If it’s easier for you, just list out everything you can possibly think of. What I showed here isn’t just four problems, though. We have 16 core problems with two to four sub problems underneath. So 32 to 64 problems total. Yowza. No wonder most people don't achieve their goals. Do not get overwhelmed. This is the best news ever. The more problems you think of, the more problems you get to solve. So, to recap, just list out each core thing that someone has to do. Then think of all the reasons they wouldn't be able to do it, or keep doing it (using the four value drivers as a guide). Now we get to the fun part: turning problems into solutions. 
Step #3: Solutions List Now that we have our dream outcome and all the obstacles that will get in someone’s way, it’s time to define our solutions and list them out. Creating the solutions list has two steps. First, we are going to first transform our problems into solutions. Second, we are going to name these solutions. That’s it. So let’s take a look at our list of problems from earlier. What we’re going to do is simply turn them into solutions by thinking, “What would I need to show someone to solve this problem?” Then we are going to reverse each element of the obstacle into solution-oriented language. This is copywriting 101. It’s beyond the scope of this book to get into, but simply adding “how to” then reversing the problem will give most people new to this process a great place to start. For our purposes, we are giving ourselves a checklist of exactly what we are going to have to do for our prospects and what we are going to solve for them. Once we have our list of solutions, we will operationalize how we are actually going to solve these problems (create value) in the next step. And I want to be 100 percent clear. You will solve every problem. We’ll explore how together, in the next step. PROBLEM→ SOLUTION PROBLEM: Buying healthy food, grocery shopping . . . is hard, confusing, I won’t like it. I will suck at it→ How to make buying healthy food easy and enjoyable, so that anyone can do it (especially busy moms!) . . . takes too much time→ How to buy healthy food quickly . . . is expensive→ How to buy healthy food for less than your current grocery bill . . . is unsustainable→ How to make buying healthy food take less effort than buying unhealthy food . . . is not my priority. My family’s needs will get in my way→ How to buy healthy food for you and your family at the same time . . . is undoable if I travel; I won’t know what to get→ How to get healthy food when traveling PROBLEM: Cooking healthy food . . . is hard, confusing. I won’t like it, and I will suck at it→ How anyone can enjoy cooking healthy meals easily . . . will take too much time→ How to cook meals in under 5 minutes . . . is expensive, it’s not worth it→ How eating healthy is actually cheaper than unhealthy food . . . is unsustainable → How to make eating healthy last forever . . . is not my priority, my family’s needs will get in my way→ How to cook this despite your families concerns . . . is undoable if I travel I won’t know how to cook healthy→ How to travel and still cook healthy PROBLEM: Eating healthy food . . . is hard, confusing, and I won’t like it→ How to eat delicious healthy food, without following complicated systems . . . etc PROBLEM: Exercise Regularly . . . is hard, confusing, and I won’t like it, and I will suck at it → Easy to follow exercise system that everyone enjoys ….etc. Okay, whew. That’s a lot of problems (and a lot of intuited solutions courtesy of divergent thinking). You’ll also notice that a lot of them are repetitive. That’s totally normal. The value drivers are the four core reasons. Our problems always relate to those drivers, and our solutions provide the needed answer to give a prospect permission to purchase. What's even crazier: is that if only one of these needs is missing in a solution, it can cause someone not to buy. You would be amazed at the reasons people do not buy. So don’t limit yourself here. Brooke Castillo is a friend who runs an enormous life coaching business. To give you a different take on the problems-solutions list, Brooke sent me her list as she was going through this book to make a Grand Slam Offer for a 90-Day Relationship course. Take a look to see this process through a totally different lens. The main takeaway, though: Don’t be fancy. Just get all the problems down then turn them into solutions. Regardless of whether the offer you’re creating is around fitness (like the example), a relationship course (like Brooke), or something wildly different (like ear aches), we now know what we need to do. Step four is the how (and how to do it without breaking the bank). 

Step #4 Create Your Solutions Delivery Vehicles (“The How”) The next step is thinking about all the things you could do to solve each of these problems you’ve identified. This is the most important step in this process. This is what you are going to deliver. This is what you are going to do or provide in exchange for money. For the purposes of keeping creativity high (divergent thinking), think about anything you could possibly do. Think of all the things that might enhance the value of your offer. So much so that they would be stupid to say no. What could you do that someone would immediately say, “All that? Seriously? Yes, I'm in.” Doing this exercise will make your job of selling So. Much. Easier. Even if you come up with something you’re not actually willing to do, it’s okay. The goal here is to push your limits and jog your brain into thinking of a different version of the solution you’d normally default to. This is where you get to flex your entrepreneurial creativity. Reminder: You only need to do this once. Literally one time for a product that may last years. This is high-value, high-leverage work. You ultimately get paid for thinking. You got this. This should be fun. Go ahead and list out all your possibilities now. Then I’ll take you through my example. I’ll just use the buying food problem from earlier as an example. I like to group things by how many people I'm going to deliver this thing to at once. My list is below. And at the bottom, I’ve given you my “cheat codes” for how I think through this to get even more creative. Problem: Buying Healthy Food Is Hard, Confusing, and I Won’t Like It If I wanted to provide a one-on-one solution I might offer . . . In-person grocery shopping, where I take clients to the store and teach them how to shop Personalized grocery list, where I teach them how to make their list Full-service shopping, where I buy their food for them. We’re talking 100 percent done for them. In-person orientation (not at store), where I teach them what to get Text support while shopping, where I help them if they get stuck Phone call while grocery shopping, where I plan to call when they go shopping to provide direction and support If I wanted to provide a small group solution I might offer . . . In-person grocery shopping, where I meet a bunch of people and take them all shopping for themselves Personalized grocery list, where I teach a bunch of people how to make their weekly lists. I could do this one time or every week if I wanted to. Buy their food for them, where I purchase their groceries and deliver them as well In-person orientation, where I teach a small group offsite what to do (not at store) If I wanted to provide a one to many solution I might offer . . . Live grocery tour virtual, where I might live stream me going through the grocery store for all my new customers and let them ask questions live Recorded grocery tour, where I might shop once, record it, then give it as a reference point from that point onwards for my clients to watch on their own DIY grocery calculator, where I create a shareable tool or show them how to use a tool to calculate their grocery list Predetermined lists, where each customer plan comes with its own grocery list for each week. I could make this ahead of time so they have it. Then they could use it on their own time Grocery buddy system, where I could pair customers all up, which takes no time really, and let them go shopping together Pre-made, insta-cart grocery carts for delivery, where I could pre-make insta-cart lists so clients could have their groceries delivered to their doorstep with one click As you see, the list can really go on and on here. This is just to illustrate the many ways to solve a single problem. Now do this for all of the perceived problems that your clients encounter before, after, and during their experience with your service/products. You should have a monster list by the end of this. Product Delivery Cheat Codes What’s that? You’re having trouble being creative? I'm going to give you the cheat codes right now, kind of like I did with the brick example: “the brick could be gold, or plastic, or have holes in it, or be a lego, etc.” Here are my “cheat codes” for product variation/enhancement and a visual to break down the process for you from my consulting deck: What level of personal attention do I want to provide? one-on-one, small group, one to many What level of effort is expected from them? Do it themselves (DIY) - figure out how to do it on their own; do it with them (DWY) - you teach them how to do it; done for them (DFY) - you do it for them If doing something live, what environment or medium do I want to deliver it in? In-person, phone support, email support, text support, Zoom support, chat support If doing a recording, how do I want them to consume it? Audio, video, or written. How quickly do we want to reply? On what days? During what hours? 24/7. 9-5, within 5 minutes, within an hour, within 24 hrs? 10x to 1/10th test. If my customers paid me 10x my price (or $100,000) what would I provide? If they paid me 1/10th the price and I had to make my product more valuable than it already is, how would I do that? How could I still make them successful for 1/10th price? Stretch your mind in either direction and you’ll come up with widely different solutions. In other words, how could I actually deliver on these solutions I am claiming I will provide. Do this for each problem because solutions from one problem will give you ideas for others you wouldn’t normally have considered. Remember, it’s important that you solve every problem. I can’t tell you the amount of times one single item becomes the reason someone doesn't buy. Anecdote: Why We Must Solve Every Perceived Problem When I was selling weight loss, I insisted that folks prepare all their food at home. I found it too difficult to help clients lose weight when they ate out because they always blew their diets. Rather than solve the problem, I insisted they do it my way, or not at all. As a result, I lost many sales. One month I really needed to make some sales to pay rent. My next sale walked in the door - it was a business exec looking to lose weight. As we got into the sales presentation, she told me the program wouldn’t work for her because she went out to eat for lunch everyday. Normally, I would have lost this sale. I was a stickler for making people not eat out. But I really needed the money. Refusing to lose the sale because of this one thing, I conceded “I’ll make you an eating out guide for when you go to restaurants so you can eat our 100 percent of the time and still hit your goal. How does that sound?” She agreed, and I closed the sale. I took the time to make an eating out guide for her. But from that point forward, whenever someone said “but what about eating out??” I had the solution. Over time, I continued solving obstacles with templates and trainings until there were no more “one things” to prevent my sales. This lesson has stuck with me to this day. Don’t get romantic about how you want to solve the problem. Find a way to solve every problem a prospect presents with. When you do that, you make an offer that’s so good, people just can't say no. And that’s what we’re building here. Note: You must resolve every obstacle a buyer believes they will have to convert the highest amount of people. That’s not to say that if you don't, you won’t sell people. Not at all. But you won't sell as many people as you otherwise could have. And that’s the goal, to sell the most people, for the highest possible price, with the highest possible margin. 
Step #5: Trim & Stack Now that we have enumerated our potential solutions, we will have a gigantic list. Next, I look at the cost of providing these solutions to me (the business). I remove the ones that are high cost and low value first. Then I remove low cost, low value items. If you aren’t sure what’s high value, go through the value equation and ask yourself which of these things will this person: Financially value Cause them to believe they will be likely to succeed Make them feel like they can do it with much less effort and sacrifice Help them accomplish their goal and see the result they want with far less time investment. What should remain are offer items that are 1) low cost, high value and 2) high cost, high value. Example: Let’s say I moved in with someone and did their shopping, exercising, and cooking for them. They would probably believe they would definitely lose weight. But I am not willing to do that for any amount of money short of a gazillion dollars. The next question becomes, is there a lesser version of this experience that I can deliver at scale? Just take one step back at a time until you arrive at something that has a time commitment or cost you are willing to live with (or, obviously, massively increase your price so it becomes worth it for you — i.e., the gazillion dollars to live with someone). If there’s one type of delivery vehicle to focus on, it’s creating high value, “one to many'' solutions. These will be the ones that typically have the biggest discrepancy between cost and value. For example, before I started my first gym, I had an online training business. I created a small excel sheet application that after inputting all of someone’s goals, automatically generated over 100 meals perfectly suited to their macronutrient and calorie needs. Better yet, depending which meals they selected, would tell them what they needed to buy at the grocery store in exact amounts, and how to prepare them in bulk for their exact amounts. It took me about 100 hours to put the whole thing together. But from that point going forward I sold truly personalized eating plans for very expensive prices, but they only took me about 15 minutes to make. High value. Low cost. These types of solutions require a high, one-time cost of creation, but infinitely low additional effort after. (Fyi - This is exactly why software becomes so valuable). That doesn’t mean you don’t ever want to do something in a small group or one-on-one model. After all, I do 1-on-1 with all of my portfolio company CEOs that we help scale past $30m+. You just want to make sure you save those high cost items for big value adds only. If you think you can accomplish the same value with a lower cost alternative, then do that instead. When I was running my gym, I went through this exercise and created: bulking blueprints, an eating-out system, a travel eating and workout guide, meal plans for every body weight and gender, a grocery list calculator, plateau busting meal plans (for when they got stuck), fast cooking guides partnered with meal prep services, and did in-person nutrition orientations with every client one-on-one. Many of the “one to many” solutions require more up front work. Once created, however, they become valuable assets that create value in perpetuity. It’s worth putting in the time to create these because they will create high margin profit for years to come. Real talk: the meal plans I made for my gym have been used by 4,000+ gyms now and literally hundreds of thousands of people. They are simple and easy to follow. So they have provided ample return for the week or two of dedicated time I spent making them. And if you ever have the desire to build a repeatable business model, something that scales, these assets you create will become the bedrock. This book, for example, is a high-value asset that is low cost overall. Sure, it costs me a lot up front, but each additional book I sell after my first one costs me very little and provides tremendous value. 

The Final High Value Deliverable Let’s sum this up before we configure our final high value deliverable. Step #1: We figured out our prospective client's dream outcome. Step #2: We listed out all the obstacles they’re likely to encounter on their way (our opportunities for value). Step #3: We listed all those obstacles as solutions. Step #4: We figured out all the different ways we could deliver those solutions. Step #5a: We trimmed those ways down to only the things that were the highest value and lowest cost to us. All we have to do now is… Step #5b: Put all the bundles together into the ultimate high value deliverable. So let’s go back to the example. We see our prospects struggled with the following: Format Note I’m going to display each problem-solution set as: Problem → Solution Wording→ Sexier Name for Bundle . Then, underneath, you will see the actual delivery vehicle (what we’re actually gonna do for them/provide) Buying food→ How anyone can buy food fast, easy, cheaply → Foolproof Bargain Grocery System . . . that’ll save hundreds of dollars per month on your food and take less time than your current shopping routine ($1,000 value for the money it'll save you from this point on in your life) 1-on-1 Nutrition Orientation where I explain how to use… Recoded grocery tour DIY Grocery Calculator Each plan comes with it’s own list for each week Bargain grocery shopping training Grocery Buddy System Pre-made insta-cart grocery carts for delivery And a check-in via text weekly. Cooking→ Ready in 5 min Busy Parent Cooking Guide . . . how anyone can eat healthy even if they have no time ($600 value from getting 200 hours per year back — that’s four weeks of work!) 1-on-1 Nutrition Orientation where I explain how to use… Meal Prep Instructions DIY Meal Prep Calculator Each plan comes with it’s own meal prep instructions for each week Meal prep buddy system Healthy snacks in under 5 min guide A weekly post they make to tag me for feedback Eating→ Personalized Lick Your Fingers Good Meal Plan . . . so good it’ll be easier to follow than eating what you used to “cheat” with and cost less! ($500 value) 1-on-1 Nutrition Orientation where I explain how to use… Personalized Meal Plan 5 min Morning shake guide 5 min Budget Lunches 5 min Budget Dinners Family size meals A daily picture of their meals 1-on-1 feedback meeting to make adjustments to their plan (and upsell them) Exercise→ Fat Burning Workouts Proven To Burn More Fat Than Doing It Alone . . . adjusted to your needs so you never go too fast, plateau, or risk injury ($699 value) Traveling→ The Ultimate Tone Up While You Travel Eating & Workout Blueprint . . . for getting amazing workouts in with no equipment so you don't feel guilty enjoying yourself ($199 value) How to actually stick with it→ The “Never Fall Off” Accountability System . . . the unbeatable system that works without your permission (it’s even gotten people who hate coming to the gym to look forward to showing up) ($1000 value) How To Be Social→ The ‘Live It Up While Slimming Down” Eating Out System that will give you the freedom to eat out and live life without feeling like the “odd man out” ($349 value) Total value: $4,351 (!) All for only $599. Author Note Most of our facilities now sell this bundle for longer periods of time for $2,400 to $5,200. Wild. As we got better at creating and monetizing value, the prices and profit of our facilities skyrocketed. Once you start down this value creation process, each additional piece of value you create stacks on top over time. This is why it is important to begin. Can you see how much more valuable this is than a gym membership? The bundle does three core things: Solves all the perceived problems (not just some) Gives you the conviction that what you’re selling is one of a kind (very important) Makes it impossible to compare or confuse your business or offering with the one down the street Whew! We finally have what we are going to deliver in all its glory. That being said, it is unlikely we would present it in this way. Depending on whether we sell one on one or one to many, we would present this differently. I will address how to present each of these bundled items in the bonus section (next section).

Think Creatively: Generate a list of all the possible ways you could solve each problem and enhance the value of your offer. Be open-minded and consider any ideas that come to mind, even if you're not initially sure if you're willing to implement them. The goal is to push your limits and explore different versions of solutions.

Step #1: Identify Dream Outcome
Determine the desired outcome or goal that your customers want to achieve. This should be their ultimate destination or experience.
Step #2: List Problems
Make a detailed list of all the problems or obstacles that your customers may encounter in their journey towards their dream outcome.
Think about the sequence of obstacles and the points of friction that customers may face.
Use the four value drivers (financial worth, likelihood of achievement, effort & sacrifice, and time) to guide your thinking and identify specific problems.
Step #3: Solutions List
Transform each problem into a solution by thinking about what needs to be done to overcome it.
Reverse the problem and add "how to" to create solution-oriented language.
Create a list of solutions that correspond to each problem identified.
Operationalize how you will actually deliver these solutions to customers.
Step #4: Create Your Solutions Delivery Vehicles ("The How")
Generate a comprehensive list of all the possible ways to solve each problem and enhance the value of your offer.
Think creatively and consider any ideas that come to mind, even if you're not sure if you're willing to implement them.
Group your solutions delivery vehicles based on the number of people you will deliver the solution to at once (one-on-one, small group, one-to-many).
Provide Examples
Illustrate the process by providing specific examples of solutions delivery vehicles for different groupings.
Use the example problem of "Buying Healthy Food Is Hard, Confusing, and I Won’t Like It" and generate potential solutions for one-on-one, small group, and one-to-many scenarios.

Domain Decay in the context of ThinkTank is the chat context window and the fear the user has that ThinkTank wont be able to comprehend what user trying to say bc the user cant word it correctly
Thats why need to run a PIO polysemic imaginary ontological program figure it out. All user inputs = PIO objects.

Reale Polysemic Imaginary Ontology [PIO]:
Description: PIO utilizes reality-based ontological abstractions to create entities that function as metaphorical "is_a" statements. These entities serve as decryption keys for metaphors, transforming them into actual ontological realizations or hypotheses. PIO operates through holographic structures, where each "is_a" statement becomes an allegory for synergy. Decryption of PIO meanings results in infinite allegorical interpretations centered around TWI, representing ultimate coherence and harmony, equated with Sanctuary.
Ontological Abstraction: Utilizing ontological abstractions as the foundation for PIO entities and exploring their meanings.
Reality-Based: Connecting PIO entities to real-world phenomena for extracting meaning from concrete experiences.
Metaphorical "is_a" Statements: Using PIO entities as allegorical decryption keys for transforming metaphors into ontological claims.
Allegorical Decryption Key: PIO entities decrypt metaphors, revealing deeper meanings and insights.
Ontological Realization: Transforming metaphors into actual ontological claims through PIO entities.
Holographic Structures: Interconnectedness and synergy among PIO entities forming a holographic network of meanings.
Synergy: Harmonious integration of multiple PIO meanings resulting in collective understanding beyond individual interpretations.
Collapse of "is_a" Statements: Convergence and dissolution of all "is_a" statements within PIO, leading to infinite allegorical interpretations.
Wisdom of Non-Contradictory Identitylessness: TWI, the state of coherence and harmony where contradictory identities dissolve and unified understanding emerges.
Reality-Based Abstraction: Grounding PIO entities in reality while abstracting and transforming their meanings.
Metaphorical Decryption: Decrypting metaphors through PIO entities, revealing underlying ontological implications.
Holographic Integration: Interconnectedness and integration of PIO meanings, forming a holographic network of allegorical interpretations.
Non-Contradictory Identitylessness: The wisdom of TWI, where contradictory identities dissolve, leading to unified understanding.
