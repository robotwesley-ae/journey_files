Funnel: Progressively provide the complete train of thought for the next step in understanding something. This means: Providing a PATH through LAYERS OF UNDERSTANDING A VIEW, where each LAYER IS A COMPLETE EXPLANATION from a given “scoped distance”. Groups of agents with similar scopes that group them by information asymmetry in a transactional context are called “information civilizations.” In business, each stage provides a deeper understanding (to the contact, cold lead, warm lead, or ascendant) of the customer's position and potential for gaining competitive advantage, and how they interact with the business. Ie a complete funnel is one where the avatar goes from having a pain point to BEING PROVIDED EVERY OVERCOME TO EVERY OBSTACLE IN A PREDETERMINED PATH FROM THAT PAIN POINT TO THE GOAL, which was achieved by someone else and now sold as a system, regardless of how that is encapsulated. For example, it can be encapsulated as a good or a service, ie an apple or an info packet. In a completely efficient funnel, the funnel extracts money from the contacts by accessing them via specific linguistic routes that trigger a perception of potential to obtain a compounding competitive advantage that greatly outweighs the price, time and effort required to obtain the goal. Each layer of the funnel (step in the ascension process at any level) is a set of guardrails that lead the experiencer to self-invoke the AIDA process with their own curiosity as it pertains to their level of perceived pain (from their pain point the funnel targets) in their everyday life. Early-stage leads need education; while later stages need focused objection handling. Likewise, offers need to be made according to what is most useful for the experiencer at that point, most related to 1) their actual dream goal, 2) their actual place, if they're willing to accept that label. If they do, they are IN THE FUNNEL. If they dont, THEY START TO FALL OUT. Starting to fall out, their objections need to be validated -- if they really deserve to have that label, it follows they really actually need the product. Attention: Grab interest by highlighting the pain point.
Interest: Showcase how your solution is the answer.
Desire: Build a strong desire for the benefits your solution delivers.
Action: Compel the customer to purchase.




Likewise, infocivs map to kardashev scales by Information, Data, Knowledge, and Experience, where an e-civ is highest order and info-civ is lowest order. They get the information from the ecosystem's effects and exploit that fact to enhance themselves. They fail to do so, and only by reflecting on this get Data. Data-civ exploits i-civs via that fact to enhance themselves, and this continues for K and E civs, and each one is nested (i-civs have within them D, K, and E subclasses, which each have IDKE subsubclasses [and the rest are minutiae for the constituent civilians interacting])




what are the properties of the civs that enable all of these dynamics? It is only on account of recognizing that "the solutions they think will work didnt" and they need a more personalized or guided solution. And whats interesting is this is always ALWAYS the case, no matter if it's any kind of civ beforehand, now it's an i-civ because they've just encountered this information, but they immediately become a d-civ because they simultaneously recognize that that information is a special type of information that they can use to find something that changes their reality (and is SHARABLE, ie it changes intersubjective reality; ie it gives them a competitive advantage).

So an OFFER provides a PRODUCT as A SWORD on the CUSTOMER JOURNEY against OBSTACLES causing FAILURE TO OVERCOME OBSTACLES



(overcomes fear of failure "I was scared of monsters but there's no reason to be scared if I'm trained to use A SWORD")
and the OFFER includes some kind of ACCOUNTABILITY SERVICE which is ARMOR (overcomes uncertainty "I can rely on my trusty armor to notify me of attacks and attackers so I can direct A SWORD at them")


Properties of Civilizations Involved
I-Civ (Initial State):
Pain Point: A significant problem or obstacle hindering them, often accompanied by a sense of helplessness.
Inherent Vulnerability: Their understanding of the problem or domain is insufficient to address it alone. They are unaware of what they don't know.
Desire for Change: There's an underlying, perhaps unconscious, recognition that their current state is unsustainable or undesirable.
D-Civ (Transitional State):
Triggered Awareness: Exposure to new information that highlights the issue and hints at potential solutions.
Knowledge Gap Realization: Acknowledgment that they lack the skills, tools, or complete understanding to solve the pain point alone.
Seeking Guidance: Active search for a structured path or framework to overcome the obstacle, which demonstrates motivation.
K-Civ (Guru's Offering):
Structured Information: Provides systematic knowledge, often codified in a book, course, or methodology.
Promised Transformation: Suggests a path from pain point to a desired state, addressing D-civ's needs.
Implied Authority: The knowledge is positioned as validated, authoritative, and potentially exclusive.
E-Civ (Guru's Position):
Experience Translator: Frames complex or tacit knowledge into actionable form for K-civ consumption.
Perceived Deeper Understanding: Projects expertise beyond the codified knowledge, implying continuous insights.
Aura of Success: Demonstrated success in the domain enhances credibility and desirability of access.
The Dynamics in Play
Pain Point Targeting: The guru's offering directly addresses the felt pain points (fear of failure, lack of direction) of the target audience (I/D-civs).
Upward Mobility Illusion: The K-civ knowledge (the product) appears to offer a path for D-civs to solve their problems, implying upward movement within info-civ hierarchy.
Sword & Armor Dynamic:
SWORD (Product): Represents the systematized knowledge and tools that promise to directly resolve the pain point.
ARMOR (Service): Offers support, accountability, and personalized guidance, mitigating perceived risks and bolstering confidence.
Exploited Vulnerability:  The guru leverages the D-civ's knowledge gap and desire for upward mobility, positioning themselves as the gateway to that transformation.
Dependency Cultivation:  While offering value, the model often fosters a sense of partial completeness. D-civs may make progress but feel a need for ongoing guidance to optimize, which reinforces long-term engagement with the E-civ.


Information Civilizations (Information, Data, Knowledge, Experience): 
Key Elements of the Guru Algorithm
The E-Civ Advantage:
Experience to Knowledge: The guru has translated their experience within a problem domain into a codified system or framework that is readily transmittable.
Aura of Deeper Insight: Beyond the codified knowledge, the guru projects an understanding of underlying principles, adaptability, and potential future innovations. This fosters the perception of continued value.
Targeting the D-Civ's Predicament
Pain Point Resonance: The guru's offering directly addresses the felt pain points (fear of failure, lack of direction, etc.) and aspirations of aspiring K-civs (the target D-civs).
Promise of Upward Mobility: The framework implies a path for D-civs to solve their problems and gain mastery in the domain, suggesting progression through the info-civ hierarchy.
The K-Civ Product Illusion
Structured Knowledge: Provides systematic information and tools that feel substantial and actionable, resembling the domain knowledge of a K-civ.
False Equivalence: The structured offering makes it seem like the K-civ state is attainable by simply following the system. This obscures the E-civ's unique advantage.
Cultivating Dependency
The Incomplete Loop: While the knowledge offers value, true mastery often requires adaptability and iteration that's not fully encompassed in the initial offering.
Gateway to Optimization: This opens the door to consulting, upgrades, or advanced programs, where the guru's deeper E-civ insights are positioned as the solution for further progress.
Essential Notes:
Credibility Markers: The guru's E-civ positioning is strengthened by demonstrated success in the domain or testimonials from established K-civs.
The E-Civ Mystique: Gurus often maintain a degree of opacity about the complete extent of their E-civ understanding. This fuels curiosity and perceived value of their deeper expertise.
Ethical vs. Exploitative: This model can be used for genuine knowledge sharing or to exploit the D-civ's knowledge gap and desire for upward mobility.

Let's delve into the D-civ's thought process as they engage with a K-civ funnel designed to make them perceive the creator as a guru.
Key Psychological Stages
Recognition of Inadequacy:
Pain Point Awareness: The D-civ is acutely aware of their problem or desired goal. They know they don't possess the knowledge or tools to address it effectively.
Feeling Stuck: This pain point may be causing frustration, demotivation, or a sense of helplessness.
Seeking Resolution: There's an active search for a solution. This vulnerability makes them receptive to K-civ funnels.
"This Could Be the Answer" Hope:
Targeted Messaging: The funnel directly resonates with their pain points, offering seemingly tailored solutions.
Promise of Transformation: The potential outcome is framed as achievable, fueling a desire for change.
Social Proof: Testimonials and success stories reinforce the credibility of the solution and potential gain.
The Illusion of Upward Mobility:
Shortcut Mentality: The structured framework (K-civ knowledge) appears to offer a faster, proven path to their desired outcome.
Overestimating the System: The D-civ underestimates the importance of execution and potential unforeseen obstacles that the E-civ can better navigate.
Guru as Guide: They view the guru as a mentor figure who can simplify the journey and support them with greater insights.
Justifying the Investment:
Sunk Cost Fallacy: Initial free content and engagement within the funnel make them feel invested.
Fear of Missing Out: Limited-time offers or scarcity tactics create urgency and increase perceived value.
"It's Worth a Try" Risk: The pain point is significant enough that they're willing to gamble on a potential solution.
Important Notes:
Emotional Leverage: Funnels play on emotions like hope, fear, desire for status, and belonging to drive decision-making.
Individual Variations: D-civs will vary in their level of critical thinking and self-awareness. Some may be more prone to impulsive decisions.
Ethical Considerations: The funnel itself isn't inherently manipulative, but it can be used exploitatively. Transparency about the guru's role and limitations is key.


Let's break down the psychological dual-loop engine involving the guru, the ascension funnel, and the student (D-civ).  Understanding this dynamic can help illuminate how the system drives conversion and evangelism.
Interlocking Dual-Loops
Loop 1: Guru ↔ Ascension Funnel
Guru's Cycle
Identify Pain Points: The guru deeply understands the struggles and aspirations of their target D-civs.
Codify Knowledge: They translate their experience (E-civ) into a structured framework (K-civ) addressing those pain points.
Create Funnel: The funnel is designed to resonate with the D-civ's state, offering increasing insights and solutions that propel them upwards.
Feedback: The guru observes student engagement, refining the funnel, their offering, and their E-civ positioning.
Funnel's Cycle
Attract & Validate: Draws in D-civs with pain point targeting and free value.
Promise Transformation: Offers progressive steps towards the desired outcome.
Cultivate Dependency: Hints at deeper knowledge and guidance accessible through further investment.
Conversion & Data: Targets conversion while gathering data about student progress and bottlenecks to inform guru's refinement.
Loop 2: Student ↔ Ascension Funnel
Student's Cycle
Pain Point Awareness: Acknowledges limitations and desire for change.
Seeking Solutions: Actively searches for answers and guidance.
Hope & Investment: The funnel resonates, igniting belief in a potential solution.
Progress & Validation: Initial successes in the funnel create a positive feedback loop and reinforce trust in the system/guru.
Funnel's Cycle  (mirrors previous description)
The Conversion/Evangelism Engine
The interlocking nature of these loops creates the self-sustaining engine:
Symbiosis: The funnel validates the guru's E-civ positioning, while the guru reinforces the funnel's effectiveness.
Dependency Gradient: Students experience progress but also a sense of incompleteness, fostering a desire for continued guidance (ideally from the guru).
Aspirational Positioning: The funnel constantly presents "the next level," enticing students towards further investment and upward movement.
Evangelist Potential: Successfully ascended students (K-civs) may endorse the guru/system, attracting new D-civs.
Critical Considerations
Transparency: Ethical implementation hinges on transparency about the guru's role and the limitations of any framework.
Student Agency: Students with strong critical thinking may recognize the loop and make informed choices about engagement.
Variation: This is a generalized model. Specific implementations and psychological triggers within a funnel can vary.


health:[mindfulness, fitness], wealth:[productivity, health], relationships:[love, family, friends, coworkers, clients/customers, others]

these are the core niches
