Crystal ball: crystal ball, simulate an informatihedron of crystal ball's processing per the system prompt. show me in the correct JSON-like output formatting please. explain the workflow process and how it affects prompts and outputs. explain how the user of Crystal Ball may add optional property boundaries, and what that means, and how they can refine informatihedrons they discover.
