THIS WEEK (Friday): Implement basic SDNA Progenitor superfactory (*1)
Break into agent topology and create specialized token heavy agents
Create Persona Prompt Superfactories for X-morphisms
People hit button
Button do agent
Agent send email w personas inside
OR agent make agent factory for X, which they can use to drilldown further (it has a specified version of SDNA Prog as the top, and copies the same topo as (*1), making it (*2). They then query it to make (*2’s).
Use case
U want to learn something, need a set of personas to help u learn the domain
U want to onboard/offboard and u need personas to explain your company specific processes: requires: ontology or flowcharts of processes or nat lang as inputs
U have a funnel and u want to support each ascension step with personas
U have a service and u want to support each feature in the feature set with personas
Very crude MVP, but it will work
