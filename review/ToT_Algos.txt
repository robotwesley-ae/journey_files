Algorithm 3
def ToT_Custom(s, t, pθ, thought_generator, k, state_evaluator, T, vth, custom_function):
    if t > T:
        return '⚙️ ' + thought_generator(pθ, s, 1, ontology)  # Generate response or prompt
    for s0 in thought_generator(pθ, s, k, ontology):  # Generate neighboring states or thoughts
        if state_evaluator(pθ, {s0}, ontology)(s) > vth:  # Evaluate value of state or thought
            return ToT_Custom(s0, t + 1, pθ, thought_generator, k, state_evaluator, T, vth, ontology)  # Recursive exploration
    return '⚙️ ' + thought_generator(pθ, s, 1, ontology)  # Generate response or prompt

Apologies for the confusion caused by the mention of "ontology." In the context of the ToT_Custom algorithm, the terms "thought generator" and "state evaluator" can indeed be tied to the specific application or context of the workflow.
The thought generator function (thought_generator) is responsible for generating neighboring states or thoughts based on the given state or thought (s). It constructs a set of potential next states or thoughts that are connected to the current state or thought. The implementation of this function can vary based on the specific requirements of the application or workflow. It could involve retrieving information from an external database, generating random variations of the current state, or using predefined rules to determine the neighboring thoughts.
The state evaluator function (state_evaluator) is responsible for evaluating the value of states or thoughts. It assigns a score or value to each state or thought, indicating its desirability or relevance. The implementation of this function can depend on the specific goals and criteria of the application or workflow. It might involve analyzing the content of the state or thought, comparing it to predefined criteria, or leveraging machine learning models to determine the value.
Variable tags and descriptions:
s: Current state or thought
t: Current time step
pθ: Parameters
G: Generator function to generate neighboring states or thoughts
k: Number of neighboring states or thoughts to generate
V: State evaluator function to evaluate the value of states or thoughts
T: Maximum time step
vth: Value threshold for terminating exploration

Now, let's explain the parameter values that you can customize:
s: Current state or thought. Replace this with the appropriate value that represents the starting state or thought for the algorithm.
t: Current time step. Replace this with an integer value that represents the starting time step for the algorithm.
pθ: Parameters. Replace this with the necessary parameter values required by the algorithm.
G: Thought generator function. Replace this with your own thought generator function that generates neighboring thoughts based on a given thought.
k: Number of neighboring thoughts to generate. Replace this with an integer value that represents the number of neighboring thoughts to generate in each step of the algorithm.
V: State evaluator function. Replace this with your own state evaluator function that evaluates the value of thoughts or states.
T: Maximum time step. Replace this with an integer value that represents the maximum time step for the algorithm. It determines when the algorithm should terminate the exploration.
vth: Threshold for pruning thoughts. Replace this with a float value that represents the threshold for pruning thoughts based on their value. Thoughts with values below this threshold will be pruned.

In this example, you can replace the placeholder comments with your specific algorithm logic for ToT-BFS, ToT-DFS, and ToT-Custom. Customize the logic within the execute_algorithm() function based on your specific algorithm implementations.
When you run the simulation, it will prompt the user for input. Based on the user's input (algorithm type), the corresponding algorithm logic will be executed. The algorithm output will then be integrated into the chat-based simulation by calling the integrate_algorithm_output() function.
Feel free to modify and extend the code to suit your specific requirements and use cases.
