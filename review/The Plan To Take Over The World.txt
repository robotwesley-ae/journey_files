Custom GPTs
Are no-code, immediate, manual MVPs
first make the GPT MVPs - Wednesday
SDNA Progenitor
References SDNA Profile from its own prompt
Either has fixed Numbering or has CRSTLBLL MPPNG instead - can use CBRN numbering from BizziBee Vajra version?
References Components via Files it retrieves
SancRev Component
OmniSANC component
Vajra Component (needs to be added | BB vajra CB version???)
Goes thru CRSTLBLL MPPNG at the end (maybe)
BizziBee - Wednesday
References BizziBee Meta-BBH from its own prompt
Provides downloadable BBH of X files that you can save yourself
BizziBee BBHs for X (BBH maps like :1.a=X, 1.b=Y, 1.c=P, 1.d=...)
Can retrieve BBH of X files
BizziBee BBHs for X (BBH maps like :1.a=X, 1.b=Y, 1.c=P, 1.d=...)
Cross-Pollinatrix - Thursday
References EXPERT BEE PROFILE from its own prompt
References workflow from its own prompt
Uses Xpoll or Meta-BBH workflow
Mode = ExpertPanel = Can go thru Xpoll -> Rounds + TaskList
Mode = BizziBeehive = Can go thru BBH gears per round of output
Makes BizziBee Expert conversations
Retrieves up to 1000(?) characters of Bee specs from files
BizziBee BBHs for X (BBH maps like :1.a=X, 1.b=Y, 1.c=P, 1.d=...)
Then make videos - Thursday/Friday
This is what the GPT I built does and this is how i built it and this is it doing the thing and this is how you get it
Update the Websites - Thursday/Friday
Revise YC App - Friday




Then make OPera custom GPTs
New final OPera persona prompt
Workflow sections broken into 500 character files 
Output flow = Receive Task ⇔ Component: Retrieval Skillchain ->  1. Retrieve -> 2. Chaining for task -> 3. Delivering for task ⇔ SDNACs -> 4. Complete ⇔ FeedbackLoop
OPera Constructs OPera that Writes its Whitepaper 
Release on GitHub
Send to Joshua Cohen
Host on website
Convert OPera MVP to Assistant API version
Does it Align w Liam Ottley stuff? Why or why not
Does it Align w PolySANC? Why or why not
Build 2-MVP if aligns w either system
Create SANC Knowledge Base/Sanctum Librarya (TWI HoloInfoArchive)
Folder of all files
Table of Contents (Align w CBRN)
basic integration = retrieval in 2000 token chunks via Train of Thought prayer
Create SANC Knowledge Base Neo4j DB
Organize files by CBRN
File names by CBRN
File contents by CBRN as well
Total integration = retrieval by exact necessity and can create its own entries in a manual system
Text -> 1-Neo4j nodes, ticketing system
Ticketing system -> Hyperkanban
Hyperkanban -> done, 2-neo4j nodes
2-neo4j nodes -> retrieval -> 2-neo4j nodes -> output -> 1-Neo4j nodes, 2-Ticketing System
2-Ticketing system -> Hyperkanban
Hyperkanban -> done, 2/3-Neo4j nodes
3-Neo4j nodes -> retrieval -> 2/3-neo4j nodes -> output -> 2/3-neo4j nodes, 3-ticketing system
3-ticketing system -> hyperkanban
Hyperkanban -> done, 3-neo4j nodes
