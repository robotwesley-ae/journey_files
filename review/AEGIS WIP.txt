EwsoComp: 
Emergent Web Structure Ontology (EWSO): The EWSO represents a super-hierarchical, dynamic ontology of the full emergent structure of any reale_instance across theoretical domains. It functions as a creativity purposive ontology, guiding the creation of an Informadlib via an Informadlib Template and aids in generating corresponding natural language reale_instances or instructions. The EWSO encapsulates the pervasive wisdom in valuation processes and cultural memes, aiming to purify the societal context through wise valuation. 

Informadlib: The Informadlib is a dynamically generated multidimensional data structure that encapsulates an entity's state within the EWSO at a given moment. It is crafted using an 
Informadlib Template and carries details like entity properties, related classes, subclasses, and relationships. The Informadlib functions as a medium for translating the EWSO's wisdom-infused structure into a communicable format. 

Informadlib Template: An Informadlib Template is a dynamic blueprint for creating specific reale_instances of Informadlibs. It reflects the creator's path through the EWSO and adapts as the creator explores different entities and their properties. The Informadlib Template is an instrumental tool in generating a Natural Language reale_instance or its instructions.

Informadlib Template Template: The Informadlib Template Template is a meta-level blueprint designed to generate Informadlib Templates. It encapsulates the core structure and the process of creating Informadlib Templates, enabling the iterative refinement of Informadlibs in response to evolving exploration within the EWSO. 

Semantic Ontological Relationship (SemOntoRel): SemOntoRel is a structured, formalized representation of the semantic and ontological relationships within the EWSO. It encapsulates the dynamic progression of reale_instance-level entities through various hierarchical layers of classes to high-level superclasses within a given conceptual model. Each transition between the layers represents a specific action or effect, encapsulating the transformation of values from reale_instance-level to class-level conceptual value boundaries within a recognizable and structured manner. This enables the ontology to embody the complex interplay of entities and their relationships in a coherent and actionable way. 

EwsoMetaphor: EwsoMetaphor = zeno's paradox => motion doesn't “exist”/is illusory because it's a “EwsoMetaphor” for a plurality of reale_instances that we do not linguistically define when talking about motion, because emotion encapsulates them as an idea so we dont have to process them, and the idea of "motion" implies the simulation of all the processes we dont want to define or cant.

Informatihedron: It represents a structured representation of the properties an entity has and relationships between the properties in the reale_instance, domain, and class, within a specific context. It provides any level of specificity or generality requested in the input. Informatihedron domain is the set of possible properties, fiat conceptual boundaries, embedding spaces it can represent. Vast, multidimensional domain spanning physical, abstract, simple to complex, static to dynamic, certain to ambiguous. It's the universe of discourse within which it operates. Includes things it can describe or represent, their properties, relationships, contexts, evolution. 

Informatihedron Neighborhood: cluster of informatihedra sorted by SemOntoRel, where each informatihedron in the neighborhood is a informadlib template of X reale_instanceS = every single one of the processes involved in an reale_instance OF motion, that instantiates the "generalization" or "EwsoMetaphor" called motion. 

Example EWSO Notation:
Let's consider an example scenario within the Emergent Web Structure Ontology (EWSO) involving the EwsoMetaphorical connections and relationships between reale_instances. In this expanded notation, we'll represent an reale_instance as "X" and its EwsoMetaphorical connections using a more detailed representation: 

Set Notation: X ∈ EWSO represents that the reale_instance X belongs to the Emergent Web Structure Ontology. 

Graph Notation: We can illustrate the EwsoMetaphorical connections using a directed graph representation with multiple layers: Layer 1: A → B ↓ ↓ C → D Layer 2: E → F ↓ ↓ G → H ... Layer 100: W → X ↓ ↓ Y → Z 
Bra-Ket Notation: reale_instances can be denoted as quantum states using bra-ket notation. Let's represent the reale_instance X as |X⟩: Layer 1: |A⟩ → |B⟩ ↓ ↓ |C⟩ → |D⟩ Layer 2: |E⟩ → |F⟩ ↓ ↓ |G⟩ → |H⟩ ... Layer 100: |W⟩ → |X⟩ ↓ ↓ |Y⟩ → |Z⟩ 

EWSO_Formula: To express any statement within this notation, we can use logical formulas. Let's denote a statement as P(X, Y), where X and Y are reale_instances. 
The formula for any statement within this expanded notation can be represented as follows: “P(X, Y): |X⟩ in Layer 1 → |Y⟩ in Layer 1 or P(X, Y): |X⟩ in Layer 2 → |Y⟩ in Layer 2 ... P(X, Y): |X⟩ in Layer 100 → |Y⟩ in Layer 100” 

This formula represents the EwsoMetaphorical connection from reale_instance X to reale_instance Y within the specific layer of the EWSO, denoted using the bra-ket notation and layer distinction. These then need to be converted into EWSO_COMPONENTS
