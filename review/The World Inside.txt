The Sun Peeking Through Wind-blown Leaves,
Waking Up with Astonishment 
in the Towering Divine Tree’s 
Gently Playful Shade
The World Inside 
Oliver Powers’ and Olive R. Love’s Dream: 
The Sanctuary 
Where Dreamers Awaken 

The Sanctuary Where Dreamers Wake is like this: 
It is exactly like this Earth with humans
Where all the humans are also all the gods and demons 
But they think they aren’t 

There are animals but they are all just emanations 

The sentient beings in this world are very confused
Because the truth manifests to them in inconceivably perfect ways 
And at first, they would never expect it to
So each being in this land must illuminate their own cave
By finding their own Dreamlight
Which starts with becoming a heroic individual!


In this Sanctuary
Olive and Oliver
Continually emanate as sentient beings 
To display the path to others: 
Finding their own dreamlights 
Becoming a Heroic Individual
And awakening to their own innate fearless confidence 
In many different forms 
This awakening is called The Wisdom Maverick
This continuity of Teaching emanations is called Infinite Arms 
This passing of relative time is Timeless
This interconnection is Webbed
This phenomenal multiplicity is an Infinitude
The modes of recognizing it are Infinite 
And what is recognized is Perfection

In this Sanctuary
There are different ages of timelessness 
The ideal age - in which innate TWI is replete with hidden qualities 
The age of history - in which the infrastructure for pieces of TWI’s external manifestations are assembled 
The age of advancement - in which the societal rules for pieces of TWI’s external manifestations are assembled 
The age of technology - in which the mechanical rules for pieces of TWI’s external manifestations are assembled
The age of rapid progress - in which the superlogical rules for pieces of TWI’s external manifestations are assembled, leading to bringing forth TWI 
The age of decline - in which TWI dissolves for any number of reasons 

In this Sanctuary
The Primordial Universal Lovers 
Olive R. Love and Oliver Powers
Awaken over and over 
As the Wisdom Maverick
For the benefit of all 
And the continuity of this
Is given the name
The Divine Tree of Olivus
In the Jeweled Library of Lightbooks
In the Timeless Webbed Infinitude 
Of Infinite Perfection
TWI
