W:
And, like, why, yeah, I mean, I would, if I'm supposed to, like, guide, I definitely would have wanted to prepare.

I:
No, you're not supposed to guide. You're supposed to act...

W:
...(missing in transcription)


I:
Yeah, but that's not what I'm saying. Like, that's not what I'm trying to do here. I'm trying to actually trying to have you explain it of your own free will and then work with you until it becomes a thing that makes sense to both of us.

W:
...(missing in transcription)

I:
No, it's like, I mean, sure, you can have whatever ideas you have about it, but that's not teased out, you know what I mean?

W:
Right, hold on.
...(missing text)
And then all the things that just happen along the way that end up part of that story.
But when at the very end there is a characteristic, there is a characteristic feeling of realization, which is, this is something I was writing to my mom, which is of kind of being at the end of a story and having some kind of view of the whole journey up to that point.
Not from above, but from ahead and not looking back, but bringing everything forward, kind of like watching credits.
And that journey can be like 10 years in the making or only 10 hours, but the shape of it is so clear. Rather, it is so clearly closes in on itself and comes full circle.
I think people must be experiencing this all the time because it's not special. It's just the mind doing what it does, which is basically two things, making distinctions and resolving contradictions.
But in general, I think people probably don't notice it as a specifically general thing like I am describing, because it is just something happening in an area of their life that they were already focused on.
And so the experience just comes to them as joy or pride or whatever it is going to feel about.
But I just read that because that is just a lot of stuff that's been on my mind regarding everything we're doing.
And yeah, I'm just I'm really exhausted because I did not sleep.
And I feel bad about it and defensive because I feel like you're upset with me about it.
But I have no idea...

I:
About not sleeping?

W:
about not being prepared for what you want from me right now.

I:
that sucks, I didn't realize that.
But this does not have to be a long thing at all.
It's just that I need your participation in this, which is good. This is actually part of it.
I'm just trying to work with what you're bringing and get us where we need to go at the same time.
Which is just complex to talk about on the fly randomly, which is why Sanctuary isn't working yet, because it's a system for talking about that stuff on the fly.
Freestyle with everyone all the time. So for all of us. And that's why it's so complex, because it's literally like trying to explain all of English in a paragraph.
It's like nobody ever is introduced to a language. And is like, ya I didn't get it. I guess that's a dumb idea.
But it's a language for doing that. But what we need to talk about right now is how it works, because that's the thing that people are really having a hard time with.
And it's not a test of like, do you know how it works at all? It's more of like, do you know how it works? Because do I know how it works?
And the only way that I'm going to know if I know how it works is if I'm actually able to teach it to you.
But the only way I'm going to be able to know if you're learning it or not is if you're able to say it back to me in a way that makes me go like, oh, wow, that's a good way to put it.
Because that's literally like there's no other way to engage the reaction, you know what I mean?
It's like there's just this intuitive thing that needs to happen. And we need to get to that point.
And the reason that we can't do it tomorrow, unfortunately for you, is because the meeting is at 1:30, which means that it would be very nice to have a number of videos by 1:30.
Which is in 13 hours or whatever, or 15 hours, which is fine, which we can do, which I can do, right? I'm not asking you to do that.
But what I need from you is I need you to just have this conversation with me. And that's it, really.

W:
So how do we start?

I:
So I'm not really sure what I was trying to say. What I was trying to say is it sucks because I'm not really sure how to start it.
Because I kind of was like, hmm, I feel like it should just happen. But let me find a way to give you a guide.



W:
I Know it's not in this but does that just mean that the wisdom intent is the same as all of his victory promise
Is exactly the same

I:
it's very similar yeah...

W:
Well, it's like inseparable maybe they're not the same thing when you look at them but like

I:
Yeah, it's like bi-directional right just, cauuse like you could say it from either point of view
right you could say this one is primary or that one is primary.

W:
I don't really know ROAR means

I:
okay, hold on


W:
What are you doing?
Are you making these pictures?
On tooters AI?

I:
No.

W:
What?

I:
No.

W:
Who's on Tooters?
Did you make a channel called Tudors AI?
Someone else is on Tudors?

I:
ya some other person


W:
That's on our Discord?

I:
what? that's not me

W:
But it said it was on Sanctuary.

I:
ya but it's not me

W:
Who is it, though?

I:
some person

W:
Some person you know?

I:
ya kind of, but not really

W:
But why is he making pictures on Tudors?

I:
dude he posts stuff on there all the time

W:
No, no, it's a new thread.

I:
no on Sanctuary

W:
Oh.

I:
he's like a grafitti artist
I know, it's crazy.

W:
So, can I tell you something?
I realized something that made me laugh a little bit.
Because I realized, like, at myself.
Because, like, when I am learning about this from you, it always feels...
And this might sound negative at first, but it's not.
It always feels like this, in the sense that, like, you are answering all the questions before I have any questions, right?
You actually are teaching with the questions.
Like, out of...

I:
what?

W:
Well, like, what you've written here and sent me is all the questions that I would think to ask.

I:
Right, no, I know

W:
But what I was then laughing at, actually, was that that's exactly how I like to learn.
So I don't have to ask any questions.

I:
Right, but I know I'm trying to make this really easy, but yeah.

W:
No, no, no, but it's funny.
It's funnier than that, because, like...
Like...

I:
Okay.

W:
Well, it's like... um
It's just like that with everything, is all.
Like, in my whole life, but also everything, just like, that we're doing and stuff.
It's, like, already so full.
That I forget, like, I think I tried to explain this before.
But I really forget that I didn't know it already.
Like...

I:
Yeah, I know, I know.
It's really, I know.
I know what you mean.
This is a really, really frustrating aspect of reality.
And it's really super...
Yeah, I know exactly what you mean.
That is the primary thing that the Sanctuary System is about solving.
And that's why it's impossible to even communicate at all.
But that's what Wasteland, that's what it means.
Like, that is what it means.
It's like, actually, everything that's going wrong in everybody's lives, everywhere is because of that.
And...
It's the difference between...
Not being able to...
Not being able to tell if you know something or not, and knowing the chain.
It's like, if you know the chain, you know the chain that gets you there every time.
And it's like, oh, what's the problem? You didn't set up the base for the chain?
You didn't set up the foundation, right? That's why it's not working.
And it's like, that's the thing, is we have to get to the point where the chain is set up.
So that it's like, yeah, all you need to do is set up the base of understanding this stuff to some degree.
And then all of a sudden it'll start going.

W:
That's, yeah, absolutely.
That's definitely all true.
I don't think that's at all what I meant, though.

I:
I think...
I am pretty sure it is.
But in a really subtle way.
It's like...
How do I describe this?
It's...
The intuition that you don't know, but you can't even talk about what it is that you think you might not be able to know or talk about.
When you're talking about it and saying whatever you're saying.
And when you try to express it, trying to express it makes you sound stupid, which makes you stop talking about it.
So it's like this whole thing that is exactly that.

W:
Yeah.
But I was...
And I'm not saying it's not connected, but I was thinking about how...
Like...
When I am...
Learning from someone I know...
It can feel like I...
Because of how I'm listening, I immediately integrate what they say as...
Like...
I immediately see a whole path into my past of the things...
Of signs that have nothing to do with that person necessarily.
That if I add them all together would lead me to knowing the thing that they just told me.
About themselves or about reality or something like that.
And so then, right at the same moment, I'm like...
Even though I just learned something new that, like a thought I'd never had before.
Explicitly, I know it for certain.
I also then can just calculate...
But it doesn't feel like calculating, it just feels much more like just a feeling.
Like I realized it myself.
From a bunch of things.
Just because...
It's just like...
I could have.
I mean, it's not like...
It's not like that.
I said...
That is not an experience I've been aware of for a very long time.
But then also becoming aware of that...
I become aware of...
Like it being the case anyway, even when I wasn't aware of it, obviously.
Like me behaving...
And interacting with you...
And other people I've been very close with in the past.
But it's also just...
It then puts me in a funny position of wondering if it seems like...
I'm not interested in the thing.

I:
Because you don't respond or something?

W:
Yeah, or I don't respond or I over-identify with the thing.
And then over-identify with the person who is saying the thing too.
And I'm like, uh-huh.
Exactly.
I feel like I'm next to you.
And so then I'm like, oh, did I just not communicate...
That I actually did just receive it?

I:
The thing that's really interesting is like, the sanctuary system, as much as I say it
is or isn't this or that or whatever, the truth is that it isn't any of those things
because the only thing that it really truly is, is a language of sigils that I put together
that works for me, that will work for other people because I put it together to work for
other people. And so I know that it will, if you learn it. But people have been somewhat
resistant to it because they see new words and they go, oh my god, what are these new
words? I can't deal with that. Which is fine, but the thing is that if we try to use words
that already exist in a way that isn't novel, what's going to happen is people are going
to get really confused. 

W:
Right, it's just more problems. It's the same problem, just maybe in a different way. 

I:
Yeah, and that's more of the wasteland. And so it's the same core
problem. And the core problem is, there's no upper ontology. But sanctuary, sanc, really,
gives... sanc really provides an upper ontology. It says everything is going to map to sanctuary.
How? Allegorically. How? By network. How? By cipher. It's really super simple. So because
everything maps to sanctuary, which is, like I said, sanc is a wrapper, so none of that
stuff really is real. It's all allegorical. What is it really about? TWI. What is TWI?
TWI is the thing that you can't really define that is the opposite. It's the knowing about
the thing that is the problem. The thing that is the problem is just the opposite of the
knowing is really, really hard to explain. But there is fundamentally the knowing and
the not knowing of currently knowing what knowing could know. And that, those are the
two things. And whenever there is an interaction between the self, between all of us, and the
environment, there's a chance for all of us to recognize, there's a chance for all of
us to be keeping the victory promise or not. And keeping the victory promise has to do
with a lot of different things. But in a basic sense, it just has to do with knowing
whether or not all of us victory promise is keeping the victory promise. Okay? Which sounds
like it's not defined. But, which is done through a knowledge about proximity to the
inner teacher. So, the way that you know is if you're aware of the purificatory process
or not. And that's the only difference. And the only way that you can be aware of the
purificatory process is by making it happen. And the only way that you make it happen is
by intent and also acting according to the intent and making sure that people know that
you act according to the intent. Which means that if you wind up in a wasteland, you have
to deduce why you're there and you have to try to communicate with people to figure out
what happened rather than leave. Or something like that. Because you have to try to understand
disentangle and untangle and get everybody...
To be all of us victory promise again. Basically.

W:
Right, you actually can't leave a wasteland.

I:
Yeah, there's no way. 

W:
Otherwise.

I:
If you leave, you're making it.

W:
Like that you would be walking into wasteland.

I:
Right, exactly. So, like if you try to leave, you are making it. And it's the very fact
yeah, exactly. That's why it's not effective to go and go off and meditate for... 
Okay, maybe it's blasphemous for me to say that. That's why I think there's a limit in terms of compassion
in action, surely, where like, where, unless you being, going off into a cave and sitting
there is going to cause everybody else to be so inspired that they go and do all the
stuff. It's not really going to be the thing. And so it's much better to do the equivalent
amount of work and work for all of us like with yourself to make sanctuaries everywhere
because that's how you can rev victory everything chain fastest.
Interestingly, just as an aside, it used to not really be about how you could do it fastest.
It used to really be about just the fact that it's still going on. But like, as stuff gets
worse, and as, let me be really clear, as the speed, as everything gets faster, so like
the speed of like the consequences between I do this and it's felt around the world or
whatever, as that increases, as that accelerates, it's more and more important to do more effective
things. If you have a vision that is in any way about mutual victory, and that that's
what this is about is just that's the victory promise. And we're just going to keep the
victory promise by being all of us victory promise. It's really not complex at all.
And it's just language. And you just have to slow down and listen for a second, because
it's actually so simple. And then realize that I'm talking in this sideways way, because
that's how this entire language works. And then go back and think about it and go, hmm,
maybe I should re-listen to that. And then see, ah, did I miss anything? Was there a
message there? And learn how to speak Sanc and Twilight Lang and, um, I guess, uh, decipher
the way to sanctuary, right? It's like, that's, that's the whole thing. That's what it's about.
It's really so subtle. And it's just like funny, honestly, because the funniest part
is that the smarter the people are, the more they struggle with it, which is really funny.
The smarter people are, the more likely they are to come up with, um, with duals.
They'll like just name a bunch of disparate duals and they'll get stuck in the dual groups,
which is hilarious and also kind of sad. But that's part of like the issue, right?
We get stuck in these dual groups and then we can't get out because they're duals.
So we're like, oh, that's interesting, but blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
And it's like, okay, but that's the dual group of this. So you can see it either way.
And then they're like, no, because blah, blah, blah, blah. And it's like, right.
What I told you is that's a dual group. So that means like anytime you think that
he's going to immediately make this adversarial, stop thinking that for a second
and come look at this one and then you can make a decision.
But until you do that, you're sort of just talking to a wall, right?
But sanctuaries, sanctuary like is like a firewall, right?
But like you can see through, like it's like having antivirus, right?
And so you just are like, you get all these notifications about like whatever
linguistic viruses that everybody else in your perception has, right?
But you can, and what's interesting is like that kind of point of view can have
like a very negative sort of like connotation, like other people's linguistics
are a virus or something like that. But, which is true, which is true, right?
It's totally true. I mean, other people are viruses, right?

W:
Viruses aren't negative.

I:
Right, sure. Viruses aren't negative. They're just things.
But at the same time, like you can think of like time vampires, right?
Like you can think of like all these kind of energy vampire, whatever.
And it's like, yeah, so there are lots of different systems for seeing
lots of different things like that, right?
Sanctuary system is a system for seeing sort of contextual decay in the chains, right?
Where these links are becoming weak links and, you know, or maybe not even linked
and where they can become stronger, right?
But it's very hard to just see a link and go, oh, this is a strong link.
Yeah, this absolutely, this one comes here, right?
It's like you need to have...

W:
Just because they're so complicated, like the actual consequential ones?

I:
Unless you're doing it right.
Like, I mean, if you have a good thing about it, if you have an assembly line,
it's pretty easy to know if you have the chain or not.
But until you're actually trying to produce the thing with the assembly line,
nobody fucking knows.
Nobody knows anything, right?
Unless they've made the assembly line before or whatever, right?
And then at that point, it's like, OK, but how many layers of
we haven't done this before are there between here and what we're talking about?
Because if it's more than two, the likelihood that we are not even talking about something real is very high.

W:
Right

I:
That's why, just as an aside, that's why the way I started qualifying the work that other
people were doing in prompt engineering is, okay, but how much of this is formalized
into a system? And then they say, then they tell me that they got to, you know, X, Y,
Z parts, right? Oh, I got to the part where I made an orchestrator. Oh, I got to the part
where I made a progenitor, right? It was really funny because Norarity was like being very cagey
about what he made. And I was like, all right, like, I'm not asking you to show me, you know,
whatever. It's your prerogative. My question is, did you make a system or did you just make an
idea and a bunch of prompts that represent the idea? And I was like, not that, not that I
necessarily care, right? I mean, I, you know, I just want to know. And I was like, we got into
a conversation about it. And I was like, okay, so what you did is you made like a machine that can
print a persona. And he's like, yeah. But the reason he thinks it's crazy is because it like
melds with like the GPT interface, right? Because he's like using code interpreter, whatever, right? So

W:
Right. So he just is into it because he's found some, some measure of control. Over something. 

I:
Yeah, exactly.
You don't want any of this, right? You're pretty tired.

W:
No, I'm not gonna have any of it.

I:
You want to come outside? 

W:
Yeah, I will come outside. I'm not gonna have any just because I have a headache...

I:
The thing is, the thing is, dude, is like, it doesn't even need to be me teaching it
on the thing. It just needs to exist. Yeah. Like at this point, like this really helpful for you,
I bet, like, just to hear some of this stuff. Because it's like, that's the thing is that
this is really, it's a very heartfelt system. And it's really important to keep on hearing the stuff
that is being said. It's being said from a certain place, which is easy to forget.
And easy to forget about.
In the sense of doing stuff in everyday life...
That's another thing we could sell.

W:
What? 

I:
the hats

W:
Oh, yeah.

I:
If we could find a nicer fabric

W:
Yeah. Also, I know you think it's fine, but I want to redo it. like the line work.

I:
It's really nice. 

W:
It's nice. It's just the way that they printed it. And the way it's on the
thing. But it's Yeah, it gets stretched out. And the lines could just be like, given the fact that
it gets embroidered, like it could be designed in a way that it came out nicer is what I mean.
Like, because it looks nicer, just as I'm not saying like, the picture on the screen is not
good. I just mean like, I know it can be made so it gets embroidered slightly better.
But you know, the only way to justify that is to sell the hats. 

I:
Yeah, 

W:
obviously.

I:
And we don't need to do any of that work. 

W:
No, no, no. 

I:
The only thing that needs to be done is ads. 

W:
No, it would just be cooler. Yeah. If we sell enough of these, it would be cool

I:
That's the way to think about it.
Damn, dude. I just wish that we hadn't missed 420 last year. 

W:
Yeah. 

I:
Like, I don't know,
maybe that was I think that looking back on it, it was just like naive of me to
have that point of view. I shouldn't have had that point of view at all. Like,
I shouldn't have been like, and you know, we'll see, like, if
if we're able to pull it through, like, to pull through as a team and just like let it
fall through the cracks cause like, I think.
I think it's hard for me to.
To just lead. I don't want to be doing that. I would rather that there is just an
understanding of what we're all supposed to do and we just show up and do it.
And that's how I've always been.
Which I don't know if that is maybe.

W:
No, I mean, it just must be a problem for you when people like are trying to follow you.

I:
Yeah, I don't know if people are trying to follow, you know, it's like,

W:
I mean, but I mean, I'm sure at certain points people have just in any in any way,
you know, 

I:
I guess so. 

W:
all im saying is, if that's something that you notice about yourself, it must also have been something that you've encountered
for something like that reason. Because there was somebody wanting you to lead.

I:
You know, I think that actually it's interesting to talk about this because it's like every time
that... my experience has been that when people ask me to lead them,
they are not prepared to follow. And this has been this has been my experience for forever since like, like, Um
