CHOO 1 & CHOO 2 Stages
CHOO 1: Planning
Automobile for Chaining TaskGoal: Factory Planning via Breaking Goal into Requirements and Enumerating Automobiles from SDNA Defs for TaskRequirements.Steps.
Automobile for Chaining Factory Establishment
Worker Creation Planning
SDNA Progeny
Morph

Specific Vajra
Cross-Pollinatrix
Self-reflection version
K-NN version
Fusion version
Graph integration SDNA track
Create new graphs with integrations for new flows for new Cross-Pollinatrix for new SDNA Progeny
Create meta-track = traincar
Create new graphs encapsulating the entire process into a single button that has a single graph that can connect to other graphs
CHOO 2: Delivering
InstanceDelivering: Assembly Line Run
This step executes the Automobile from CHOO 1
InstanceChaining: Assembly Line Progenation
This step iterates CHOO 1 for drilldown after the CHOO2a step runs its entire automobile.
ONIOnMORPH
Is a system like autogen that incorporates personaTypes and ChainTypes.
Is what is wrapped in the SANCREV OPERA website
And anyone can license it
OPera
Is a prompting methodology that incorporates ONIOnMORPH and has personaTypes and chainTypes
