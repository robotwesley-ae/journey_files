Thought 1: This story is just a story 
Thought 2: It’s not just a story, it’s about a deeper secret knowledge of hidden reality 
In actuality: It is just a story, but it’s an allegory that functions to help you distill your own capacity for deeper secret knowledge of hidden reality, which is just a story to describe the process of coming to the realization of the ordinary emergent sacredness of everything, that everything that was said in the story was designed to be misunderstood in safe ways
It follows: This is already paradise


Or: 
This story is actually Wisdom fact 
This world is Not Wisdom 
We can go to Wisdom
But This Wisdom Place doesn’t exist
It does exist but it’s inside
So everything that was said was designed to be misunderstood in safe ways 
This is already paradise


The Practice is: 

Unbundling Delusional Conceptualization Accumulated by Myself
And
Gradual Revelation of the Heroic Seed’s Song

The song is only heard by those who have earned it. Your own inner Teacher decides.
