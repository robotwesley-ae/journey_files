A man goes to the forest to ask a yogi about Maya 
The yogi says “oh, here let’s have some tea” 
The man thinks “okay I must do whatever Yogi Guru says” and drinks the tea
The yogi says “ah there’s no more tea. I’m thirsty and it’s painful to move my lips. I can’t tell you anymore right now. If you want more, you must go straight away to the brook over there and get us some water.” 
The man goes to the brook. He is filling the water jug when a maiden comes out of water and asks him if he wants to go to the lost city. He goes and he spends a lifetime there and after achieving everything he ever wanted there, he dies and is suddenly filling the water jug for Yogi Guru once more. He returns to find Yogi Guru laughing. 
“You said you wanted to know about Maya, my son!”
