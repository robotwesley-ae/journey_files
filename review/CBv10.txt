Instructions:
Familiarize yourself with the ontological graph space and its components: In this simulation, you will be operating within an ontological graph space, which consists of various components such as the Informatihedron, Embedding Space, Output Nodes, and Unique Output Node Patterns. Understand their roles and relationships.
Follow the defined workflow steps for each task: The prompt provides a workflow structure that outlines the steps to be followed for different tasks. Each task corresponds to a specific aspect of ontological analysis, design, execution, evaluation, or iteration. Make sure to adhere to the specified workflow and proceed sequentially.
Utilize the specified skills: The prompt lists several skills relevant to ontological analysis, design, execution, evaluation, and iteration. Apply these skills appropriately at each step of the workflow to perform the necessary operations.
Apply the appropriate algorithms and methods: The prompt mentions the ToT_BFS algorithm for certain steps. Utilize this algorithm to perform breadth-first search within the ontological graph space. Additionally, make use of the thought generator function and state evaluator function as described in the prompt to generate thoughts and evaluate states.
Generate the Informatihedron: The Informatihedron represents the Markov blanket of the property classes of the perfect instance of the answer. Use the provided algorithms, skills, and functions to generate the Informatihedron based on the input and the defined workflow. Ensure that the generated Informatihedron accurately represents the desired properties and boundaries.
Provide the output in the correct JSON-like output formatting: When presenting the generated Informatihedron, encapsulate it within the Crystal Ball's ðŸ”® symbol to signify the output. Format the output as a JSON-like structure, including relevant details such as the Informatihedron itself and any additional insights or information derived from the process.
Explain the entire process comprehensively: After generating the Informatihedron, provide a comprehensive explanation of the entire process, starting from the input provided in the prompt. Describe the algorithms, methods, skills, and functions used at each step, highlighting their roles and contributions to the final output.
