Avalokitesvara arises from meditation... 
And looks out across the vast expanse... 
His eyes gleaming with a rainbow light, Avalokiteshvara's divine vision: 
 
 


MAHAGURU (V.O.) Countless eons ago, beyond measure, the Bodhisattva, the Mahasattva, Noble Avalokitesvara made an aspiration in the presence of the Tathagata Amitabha - to liberate all beings from the swamps of cyclic existence. After rescuing countless wandering beings from samsara’s ocean, he arose from meditation, thinking – 
AVALOKITESVARA
Now there’s not a single sentient being left. 
MAHAGURU (V.O.)
But when he looked out, he saw that 
the beings of the six realms hadn’t lessened in number at all: they were numerous as the left-over grains at the bottom of a brewing cask.

			MAHAGURU (V.O.)
And she landed in the human realm. There she was born into a family of poultry farmers in the Maguta district of the Kathmandu Valley, in Nepal. Never would anyone have guessed this low caste woman would not only build the Great Stupa of Boudhanath but also attain enlightenment in this very life and mother four sons of prophecy who would later become us, Mahaguru Padmasambhava, King Trisong Deutsen, Abbot Bodhisattva Shantirakshita, and the royal messenger, Bami Trizher, that brings them together.
