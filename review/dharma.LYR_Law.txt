Here’s a pretty good example of how the teachings of Vimalakirti’s Value Chain work:

On more than one occasion, my Teacher, Ngakchang Karma Yeshe Namgyal Rinpoche, said to me “Guru Rinpoche said: ‘Follow the law of the place you are from’”. 

What does it mean?

Guru Rinpoche = the inner teacher, inherent non-contradictory wisdom
Said = is always like this
Follow the law = the way the mindstream is set up (innermost secret samaya)
Of the place = the relationship between the mindstream mechanics of the body, speech, and mind mandalas of spontaneous presence
You are from = the transference target

On more than one occasion, I thanked my teacher, Ngakchang Karma Yeshe Namgyal Rinpoche, for grand things like “opening my mind” or “busting me for <obstacle>” and he responded in a frank, almost annoyed tone: 

“You’re welcome.”
