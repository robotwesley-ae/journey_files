The Book of Myths concerns the topic of creating societies and the systems within them. 

The secret meaning of Oedipus. 
Oedipus represents someone who takes secret language at its face value. He ends up actually making his mother his consort and killing his father, because he is blind. Instead of discovering the consort hidden behind the veil of the mother and the power hidden behind the veil of the father. It could be said everyone who doesn’t understand yet is simply making this mistake. In other words, Oedipus is the representation of the epitome of the self-torturous Dreamer. Don’t do it to yourself!
