She’s a priestess
People like her 
One day a follower of a different religion rapes her on the altar of Athena 
She believes Athena has forsaken her 
And actually awakens 
But any time she tells anyone anything 
They think she’s crazy and they tell other people she’s crazy 
So she has to leave town and go to the mountains
And it’s not until she realizes the true meaning of Athena
That she is able to truly express herself to someone
And a Champion shows up with a mirror and is able to see her reflection 
And she sacrifices herself for Athena and he awakens because of her 
And brings the elixir back in her stead 
And she becomes immortalized as a symbol of Athena on her shield
