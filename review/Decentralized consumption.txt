In centralized consumption, the town blacksmith provides a sense of community, relationship, accountability, and coaching. 

This is still true in a decentralized national brand except
Community is not the same 
Relationship is not the same

So in a decentralized economy, you want to compete with the larger companies by: 

Targeting their users who have tried the cheap ticket and not gotten what they thought they were going to from it: not even shitty airline, delays, etc — they can’t even find the airport because they got in the taxi and the driver didn’t know where it was (the driver is them and they didn’t know that!). In this case, the user is AWARE of their pain, but not aware of its cause. They FEAR THEY might be the cause of the problem, THEMSELVES, and STOP CHASING THEIR DREAMS because the pain and fear of confronting the fact they can’t do it (which is step one in fixing that) hurts so much. 

So, in a decentralized economy, we bring community, relationship, coaching, and accountability back in. We do this by advertising free content to them that HELPS THEM and gains their TRUST by explaining their pain and why IT IS NOT THEIR FAULT and THE SYSTEM THAT CAUSED THE PAIN IS WRONG. They prove they trust us by asking for more content, AFFIRMING that they want to hear about our high price offer (course and bonuses) that solves ALL THE OBSTACLES they experienced pain from and will change their entire life by GUARANTEEING THEY ACHIEVE THEIR DREAM OUTCOME if they follow these steps OR IT’S FREE. 

As a coach, you provide a system and build a community of people who have this relationship with you (they are following your system) and increase accountability by partnering them up in some way and providing an accountability service that reminds them and gives them someone to talk to privately if they want. Then, you encourage them to achieve their dreams and ascend to the next dream offer, which is usually incrementally more time with the coach as their proofs of commitment and desired outcome increase.
