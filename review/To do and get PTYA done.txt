In order to not feel bad I have to do this

I will feel really good just having some content

Even if itâ€™s just 3 min vids of the HJ stages

And then a video about how to apply them to your life



Chain
Compile notes from Google
Record this to make a video later:
Go through HJ map and map nodes from start to finish that I will touch on for each video
Make individual prompts for each one
Master template
Different individual graph sections for each stage (1 per persona) 
Have each prompt talk to the YouTube scripter
GAN
Write scripts
