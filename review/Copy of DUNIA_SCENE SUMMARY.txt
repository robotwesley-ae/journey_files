DUNIA



WIND SWEEPS THE FIELDS -
THE LAUGHTER OF PLAYING CHILDREN - 
THE MAGIC OF PEACE -

EXT. ZAIRE - RURAL FARMING VILLAGE - DAY

Small mud brick houses. DUNIA’S MOTHER and DUNIA’S FATHER work in the field as YOUNG DUNIA (12) and her sister run around, laughing.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dunia’s Mother plays tag with her daughters.

GUNSHOT RINGS CHAOS.

Father drops his crops. The game stops as Young Dunia turns and sees her mother fall to the ground - head ripped open. Sister runs to mother, a deadly mistake as -

GUNSHOTS SALVO. Strays cut the brush, pock the field. Young Dunia watches her sister get eaten by the bullets, an accidental human shield. Child soldiers creep into view from the bush line, attacking whoever they see. Dunia’s Father reaches her, picks her up and runs. Gunfire continues to crack as Young Dunia clings to her father, looking back at the carnage. She wails and grasps for her mom and sister - a hand reaching into the abyss and finding a void. Dunia’s Father runs toward the bush at the edge of the village, trying to disappear.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dunia, and her father try to escape.
He tells her to run, and that he loves her.

GUNSHOT. Father’s head explodes. Young Dunia falls to the ground, bounces up and RUNS faster than ever.

Tears stream; BULLETS SLAM into the world around her... All she can do is keep running but she barely makes it into the bush and ducks behind a tree. Eyes wide - the kind of wide only achievable when fearing for your life. Focus. She wants to move but she can’t. Bullet rain too heavy, too scary.
Cowering behind the tree, she closes her eyes tight, and covers her ears. On the other side of the tree, THREE CHILD SOLDIERS close in on her. Laughing and shooting.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Child soldiers find and accost Young Dunia in the bush.
They threaten to rape her.
Young Auni approaches, challenges the child soldier’s actions.
They dismiss Auni.
Auni shoots all three soldiers with an AK-47.
Auni extends his hand to Dunia and asks her to escape with him.
Mukuyu is alerted by the gunfire, and approaches the area.
Panicked, Auni stages the area and develops a cover story for him and Dunia.
Mukuya, young Ebenga, young Lufua, and young Tshibola show up and see the re-ordered carnage.
Mukuya is suspicious of Auni’s account of the events.
Mukuya brandishes his magic knife, and commands young Dunia to shoot her father’s corpse in the head, ostensibly to serve as proof of Auni’s account.
She shoots.

GUNSHOT/SLAM TO BLACK.

MUKUYU (V.O.)
Welcome, child.

FLASH OPEN:


EXT. CONGOLESE JUNGLE - DAY

Mukuyu, his army of child soldiers, Young Dunia and Young Auni march through the jungle until stopping to make camp on Mukuyu’s order.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mukuyu explains the military structure to Dunia, introduces squads and their leaders by name.

Mukuyu introduces Dunia to Alpha squad, and commands Alpha squad members to train her.

Ebenga questions Mukuyu’s decision, and Mukuyu lightly rebuts.


EXT. MUKUYU’S MAKESHIFT CAMP - FIRING RANGE - DAY

Young Auni finishes carving a target into a tree. Young Dunia stands a distance away holding an AK-47. Young Banyale and Christopher watch under a tree, giant backpack next to them. Young Banyale grabs a fruit from the tree and bites into it.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Auni assists Dunia in target practice with an AK-47. Banyale and Christopher observe, and make bets on her success rate. 
Dunia has trouble at first but finishes strong after encouragement from Auni.    
Christopher and Banyale comment from the sidelines.

Dunia hesitates for a moment, Ebenga interrupts to spur her on.
The magic knife exerts a manipulative influence over Dunia’s mind.

Ebenga takes the knife back from Dunia and stabs Christopher multiple times to finish him off.
The crowd of child soldiers applaud the execution.

Peaceful. Lines of civilians streaming away from the battle raging just on the other side of the bush. Young Dunia and Young Auni burst through the bush to the surprise of a man, ILONGA (20’s), driving a truck in the traffic line. All he sees are two child soldiers.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ilonga, scared at first, quickly realizes that Auni and Dunia mean him no harm, and are in fact just kids in need of help. He takes them to his village where they start new lives. Through montage, Auni and Dunia grow into adults, fall in love, and have two children.

SLAM TO BLACK.

TEXT OVER BLACK:

PRESIDENT MUKUYU controls the country with an iron fist.

After 20 years of violent conflict, an unprecedented era of peace dawns as the remaining rebel groups in the jungle run out of resources and begin to give themselves up.

Due to mounting international pressure, President Mukuyu announces DRC will begin its first peaceful transition of power, in free and fair elections, in just six months time.

Later, he announces the timeframe will be suspended, pending infrastructural developments to ensure the elections can be held country-wide.

The Congolese people, familiar with Mukuyu’s political tactics, fear he will find clever ways to delay the development of said infrastructure. United by their hope for a new Congo, Congolese from around the country volunteer to help the Office of the National Electoral Commission (CENI) implement the necessary infrastructure…

DUNIA and AUNI lead the team responsible for implementation of the infrastructural developments headed by CENI in their village.


INT. DUNIA’S VILLAGE, DRC - CENI OFFICE - DAY

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dunia and Auni talk about Mukuyu and his intentions. They are interrupted by a knock on the door, and Auni readies his gun.

They bring him inside.

IN THE HOUSE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Baraka asks Dunia about Muzuri’s whereabouts, and Dunia reassures him that Muzuri will return.

IN THE BUSH

Muzuri hears a vehicle. He stops. Looks. A pickup truck at the edge of town. He squints. Nobody in the back. No machine gun mount. Keeps scanning. Closer... a light appears! No! A torch. He finally sees: A masked death squad soldier, BANYALE (30’s, aura of evil intent), holds a torch, surrounded by other MASKED SOLDIERS with machetes and unlit molotovs.
Closing in on the village. THEY’RE FUCKING CLOSE. He can almost hear them. Muzuri BOLTS. His movement draws the attention of Banyale, who signals the squad. Death Squad moving faster now.

IN THE HOUSE

Auni closes his eyes. Deep breath.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dunia in passenger side. Eve in driver seat. Baraka in middle. Truck idling. Distant gunfire. Dunia instinctively covers Baraka’s ears.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dunia, Baraka and Eve listen to gunfire out of sight, waiting for Roland to return. Dunia and Eve grow suspicious of the situation.

EXT. DEATHSQUAD CAMP - NIGHT

LED work lights. A large fire. A number of tents. A fold out table with guns and ammo, drugs, foot, hand, and neck shackles. THREE DEATH SQUAD MINIONS, Banyale’s squad, around the fire. FOUR CAPTIVE WOMEN sit off to the side of the fire, around a rock with a bunch of chains ran through it. Their necks collared, hands and feet shackled and duct tape around their mouths. Chains running through the rock link all the neck shackles together. Like spokes on a wheel.

Impossible to escape. Dunia and Eve get dragged to the Squad. Banyale heads towards a tent.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Banyale orders one of his men to shackle the women, and warns him not to touch Dunia.

Squad Member #1 talks to himself in front of the captive women about how he wants to rape Dunia because she’s “fancy” (forbidden). Squad Member one removes the tape from Dunia’s mouth. She warns him that he’ll be killed if he touches her. He antagonizes Dunia, and threatens to cut out Eve’s tongue. Dunia still rejects him. Squad member one threatens to kill Kampata, then breaks her ankle in front of Dunia. Dunia begins to cooperate. Right before he rapes her, Dunia signals to Eve. Eve grabs Dunia’s hands, allowing Dunia to kick the squad member to the ground. Eve and Dunia overpower the squad member, Eve beating in his head with her shackles, and Dunia stabbing him in the neck. Dunia, now free, is unable to find the key to release Eve or any of the other women. Dunia escapes on her own, vowing to return with help and liberate the captive women.

INT. UN BASE - INTAKE ROOM

Dunia still bawling. Bolt-cutters chomp through the shackles. She sits in a chair in front of MONUSCO REGION 6 FORCE COMMANDER JAYA VIDYA (30s, Indian, epitome of battle- hardened).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dunia meets Vidya and tells him about the attack on her village. Dunia explains that the attacks were not perpetrated by rebels, but in fact by Mukuyu’s army, citing her recognition of the commanding officers from her experience as a child soldier. Vidya is not fully convinced. Dunia continues, explaining that they are holding other women captive as sex slaves in the nearby camp she just escaped from. Vidya explains that the UN peacekeeping forces have no jurisdictional right to investigate or police this matter. Dunia protests but Vidya dismisses her, and recommends that she rest.

EXT. UN CAMP - REFUGEE SECTION - NIGHT

Dunia walks towards the tent laden camp, liquor bottle in hand. A fire roars. Around the fire, a group of REFUGEES listen as an old woman, NGANGA NIMI (60’s) tells a story. Nimi is covered in spirit paint markings and her clothes are tied in many knots. She holds a hammer. Beside her, a humanesque wooden idol with mirror eyes and a mirror belly, a bucket of nails. Intrigued, Dunia approaches.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nganga Nimi tells a story about the evil which has infected the country, and of the Nkondi hunters who can be summoned to fight this evil and free the people from injustice. Nimi describes the summoning ritual involving nails which are hammered into an idol. Nganga Nimi introduces herself to Dunia and then leads her through the ritual to bring forth the Nkondi. Dunia performs the ritual, saying the magic words “Countless beings are bound by myriad chains, may I free them all!” and plunging the nail into the idol. Nimi comments on the potency of the ritual, and tells her that she will have a vision while she sleeps, and that she herself will become the Nkondi.


INT. DUNIA’S TENT - LATER

Dunia lies in bed, drifts asleep.

UNFAMILIAR BUSH

Flashback to the final moments with her father when she was a child. After Dunia’s father dies, she cries out for Auni.

She runs through the bush, heavy rain pours. She grows up as it becomes -

BURNING RUINS OF DUNIA’S VILLAGE

Adult Dunia runs through the village. Ebenga, standing among bodies and body parts, laughs as she passes. She looks back: Banyale, Lufua, Tshibola chasing her. Runs out of the village, into the bush. Keeps running as Banyale and co. chase.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Banyale and the others antagonize Dunia (“You’ll never escape! You can’t run forever…”)

Yells fade as she reaches the bank of a great river. Rain stops. Clear skies.

EXT. RIVERBANK

A thundering elephant trumpet resounds from the other side. Dunia looks out to see Auni, Akina, and Baraka across the river, waving to her, riding an elephant, glowing with rainbow light. Elephant enters the river and brings them over to her side. She falls to her knees and sobs as her family dismounts and embraces her.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Auni presents Dunia with her fate, telling her that she will become the Nkondi. He gives her an AK-47 which he, Baraka, and Akina all touch to imbue with their spiritual presence. Auni tells Dunia that she has been given a power called “the Eyes of Justice” which will manifest as rainbow lights in her vision. Banyale, Tshibola, and Lufua appear in the distance, but Dunia shoots them with her imbued AK-47 and they turn into light. Auni leaves Dunia with a warning that the path ahead will be hard.

Rain turns to fire.

BLINK AWAKE

Dunia stares at the bottle. It glows with rainbow light.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dunia recognizes that she now has the Eyes of Justice.

EXT. UN BASE - BARRACKS - NIGHT

Sophia on sentry, lighting a cigarette. Rainbow lights glare off her flame. Dunia approaches holding the bottle.

Dunia asks Sophia for a cigarette and lighter. They smoke together and discuss the still captive women at the deathsquad camp. Dunia is dissatisfied but Sophia reminds her that she can leave anytime. Dunia Asks for the keys to her truck, and to borrow Sophia’s lighter. Sophia obliges, and notices a shimmer in Dunia’s eyes that she hadn’t seen before.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dunia vows (“Never Again”), and covers the bodies with a sheet.

MOMENTS LATER

Dunia flips up the singed rug in her living room. Moves the dirt revealing a rope handle. She pulls it. The dirt cracks around it. She pulls hard. The CHEST she and Auni buried their guns in comes flying out of the ground and slams on the dirt floor. She unlocks the chest to reveal her AK-47 (Auni’s is missing from before), magazines, and bullets. She grabs the magazine and starts loading bullets. Click, click!

MOMENTS LATER

Dunia loads a magazine into her AK-47. Pulls the bolt. Steps out of the house with her AK-47 strapped around her shoulder, carrying the chest full of loaded magazines. Puts it in the truck. Grabs the bottle, stuffs the sheet in it - a wick - a molotov. Hops in and goes to turn the ignition but is stunned as...

She looks up to see a WHITE ELEPHANT in front of her, bathed in a moonlight rainbow. It trumpets. Ignition.

Truck flies down Congo National Road #2 back towards the Death Squad Camp. Rainbow lights guide her way. She’s close. Lights off.

EXT. DEATH SQUAD CAMP - NIGHT

Lufua unzips his tent and steps out. Lights a cigarette, unzips his pants and starts to piss. So sleepy. He looks off towards the captive area. Squints. What the fuck? Finishes pissing. Seriously, what the fuck?!? Wipes the sleep from his eyes and... sees CORPSE of Squad Member #1.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dunia launches a surprise attack on the death squad camp. Lufua is the first to notice. Banyale’s tent is set on fire by a molotov cocktail. They are all caught off guard. Gunfire begins.


EXT. DUNIA’S TRUCK - DEATH SQUAD CAMP - NIGHT

Brights on the camp. Dunia, covered by the open driver side door, sprays bullets through the rest of Banyale’s minions. A quick wave of death. Muzzle flashes light up the seats stained with Baraka’s blood from earlier.

IN THE CAMP

Bullets continue to rip through minions. Banyale hides on the ground - blinded by the truck lights. Tshibola writhes in pain.

INT. WESTERN DIAMOND MINE - SUPERVISOR’S OFFICE - NIGHT

A shocked Ebenga learns of the events of the attack at the death squad camp.

EXT. DEATH SQUAD CAMP - NIGHT

The last of the minions falls. Shooting stops. Only Tshibola remains. He scrambles to move but can’t. His leg is totally fucked. He tries to aim his pistol at Dunia but the truck brights are too blinding. He squints. Dunia aiming at him. He puts his gun down.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dunia restrains Tshibola with shackles at gunpoint. Dunia frees Eve, they hug. Dunia frees Feza, who asks Dunia about Auni and Baraka. Feza comforts Dunia. Eve frees Kampata and asks Feza to help bring the injured Kampata to the truck. Tshibola realizes who Dunia actually is, recalling that he thought her and Auni had died many years ago. Dunia learns from Tshibola that Banyale and Lufua are headed to Ebenga who is headquartered at the Belgian mine, Western Diamond. Tshibola taunts Dunia, presuming she is powerless.

Dunia speeds down the road. Eve and Feza in the truck. The other freed Captive Women in the bed with Kampata. Dunia can’t believe this is reality. It’s all starting to hit them. They’re safe. They break down, but it’s a euphoric release.

Dunia, with Nimi, realizes that Mukuyu’s magic knife has placed this dark influence on her soul. Nimi warns Dunia that she must confront this evil, both in the world and within herself in order to bring justice to her people and to keep the light of her pure heart lit.

Random Guard reaches the truck-- Oh my god... there’s no driver - only TSHIBOLA’S SEVERED HEAD STRAPPED ON TOP OF A BOMB.

EXT. UN CAMP - REFUGEE SECTION - NKONDI IDOL - DAY

Kampata pulls back and swings the hammer at her nail but... TRUCK BLOWS UP AT THE GATE AND GUNFIRE ERUPTS! She misses the

Dunia, Eve, Kampata run to her, grab her, and drag her into the bush as Peacekeepers fight off Death Squad trucks flying in through the gate.

Massive battle ensues. Bullets pock dirt in the ritual grounds, cut the bush and smash tree bark. Nganga Nimi holds strong and chants an incantation. Dunia tears her clothes to make a bandage, but Kampata is dying.

EXT. UN CAMP - VARIOUS - DAY

Dunia and company have run-ins with small groups of Death Squad but easily handle them. Whole camp is piled with corpses. Lull in the battle. It’s only the front gate now.

Dunia-- lots dead on both sides but Peacekeepers pushing the Death Squad back. Dunia looks to the ritual grounds. Nimi still dancing and chanting. Kampata nowhere in sight. Roar of trucks cause Dunia to spin towards the back fence -

A whole other brigade of trucks break through! It’s Ebenga and Lufua! The women now thrust back into the heat of combat. The women trying to move towards the ritual grounds but are being overrun! Feza runs out of bullets.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amidst the chaos, Dunia, Eve, and Feza find themselves pinned down. Dunia tells Eve and Feza to find Kampata and escape while she covers them. Ebenga and Lufua spot Dunia, and they go after her. Dunia runs to hide in the bush, Lufua pursues. A dying Kampata attempts to complete the nkondi ritual, and Nimi is shot. Ebenga, brandishing Mukuyu’s magic knife, taunts Nimi as she dies, but she responds with strength and belief in the power of the nkondi. Ebenga kills Nimi. Ebenga burns the nkondi idol, and Kampata cries. With her last ounce of will, Kampata attacks Ebenga with the nail, only to be kicked to the ground by Lufua. Lufua proceeds to threaten to rape and torture her. Ebenga stops Lufua for a moment, only to give him Mukuyu’s magic knife, and order him to “break them”. Lufua begins to rape Kampata with the magic knife. Dunia has flashes of visions of all of her traumatic experiences. Dunia here’s Nganga Nimi’s warning about “the shadow”, followed by Mukuyu’s voice “do what i want!” Dunia is in shock and faints. Feza watches as Lufua continues to rape and torture Kampata. Eve sees rainbow lights, and Eve beats Lufua’s head in with the ceremonial hammer, killing him quickly. Ebeange shoots Eve in the arm and she’s down. Kampata thanks Eve with her dying breath. Ebenga captures Eve and Vidya, and many other women. Ebenga yells out to Dunia tauntingly, challenging her to come to the diamond mine to save her friends. Ebenga, the remaining death squad members, and the many captive women leave the UN camp.


EXT. UN CAMP - REFUGEE SECTION - RITUAL GROUNDS - BUSH - DAY

Crying Feza tries to bring Dunia back to reality. Shaking her. Catatonic Dunia just looks at the aftermath. The burning idol. Nimi’s body. Kampata’s body... pools of blood.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Feza tries desperately to wake Dunia up. Dunia dealing with internal conflict first hears Mukuyu's demonic commands, which are then superseded by the voices of Auni, Baraka, and Nimi. The spirit voices give her power and she wakes up, offering her hand to Feza with the line “Don’t be afraid, just hold my hand.” Feza and Dunia embrace.








EXT. UN CAMP - REFUGEE SECTION - RITUAL GROUNDS - DAY

Dunia and Feza run up to dying Kampata. Dunia holds her. She’s still alive, barely.

WRECKED APC

APC totally flipped and shredded. Sophia recovers from the shock. Sees Feza - dead, crushed. Some of Charlie Squad still alive, also recovering. Sophia frees herself from the wreckage, pulls the pin on a smoke grenade and tosses it out. Then another.

SCAFFOLDING - MINE ENTRANCE

Dunia looks at the mine entrance. It’s DARK AS FUCK. She grabs a small handheld work light and flips it on. Throws it in the mine. It’s just one long passage with various holes in each side - digging chambers. She grabs another work light, tucks it under her gun arm. Into the mine, AK-47 out in front. Swivel.

Dunia cautiously searches for Ebenga. Looks to the left... Ebenga POPS OUT FROM THE RIGHT! She spins as he pistol whips her and her shoulder takes the hit. She drops her gun. He’s lost a lot of blood - moving like a zombie, stumbling and swaying.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ebenga and Dunia exchange taunts. Dunia jumps after the rifle, but Ebenga grabs her first. Ebenga begins to strangle Dunia on the ground, but she hits his wound and gets away. Ebeanga and Dunia struggle as they both try to get to the rifle first. Ebanga kicks Dunia to the ground, only for her to sweep his legs and grab the AK-47 herself. WIth Dunia in control, Ebenga reveals that he no longer has the magic knife, and that it is now back with Mukuyu himself. Dunia vows to kill them both soon enough.

President Mukuyu claims that the recent violence in Kivu was in fact perpetrated by a rebel group, and he proceeds to name Dunia (Dunia the Huntress) as the leader of this dangerous and violent group. Dunia is shocked. Mukuyu continues, as he both delays the election indefinitely, citing the ongoing violence, and throws the nation into a state of martial law as he imposes a curfew and full communications blackout. Mukuyu also puts out a bounty on Dunia. Dunia is still completely shocked as Vidya tries to comfort her and explains her efforts to help Dunia escape the country. Dunia resists this idea, and can only think of the continued suffering and oppression of her fellow people. Vidya tells Dunia to let it go and escape with her life. Dunia suddenly reaches a moment of clarity as she feels the power of the Nkondi and her eyes begin to glow. Dunia asks for a gun to take to Kinshasa.


EXT. UN BASE - KINSHASA - NIGHT

Heavy rain. A UN helicopter lands. Dunia and Sophia hop out. Sophia grabs a CASE from the heli. They walk to a ROW OF TRUCKS.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sophia and Dunia say goodbye to each other as Dunia loads her weapons into a truck. 


EXT. PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - NIGHT

Still raining. A motorcade leaves. Dunia tails it to:


EXT. KINSHASA RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Rain crashes like bullets. Fancy place. Motorcade pulls up. Mukuyu gets out. Dunia pulls up across the street. Opens the case. Two pistols, magazines, a waitress’ uniform, Kampata’s ritual nail. She starts changing.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dunia arms herself and papers to enter the building. She repeats the ceremonial words (Countless beings are bound by myriad chains. May I free them all!) and her rainbow eyes light up.

INT. KINSHASA RESTAURANT - LATER

Elegant. Dunia walks in, eyes glowing, and follows the shimmering lights straight to the wine room. Picks up a glowing bottle, and follows the glints through the restaurant to -


INT. KINSHASA RESTAURANT - PRIVATE ROOM

Even fancier than the rest of the place. Twelve red chairs, black walls, fireplace, perfect marble. Candle lit. Lined with WHITE MEN, wearing various pieces of clothing and jewelry with the splayed man emblem. Dunia walks through the door holding the wine bottle. She’s tense. More than before. She starts to make her way past the guests at the sides of the table to Mukuyu, at the head of the table.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mukuyu discusses his mining operations with one of the white men at the table, while Dunia pours them wine. Mukuyu accidently knocks his glass over which splashes on Dunia, causing her to drop the bottle which shatters. Mukuyu briefly apologizes, and as Dunia begins to clean the wine with her napkin (illuminated by rainbow lights) Mukuyu does a double take to ask Dunia if they have met before. Mukuyu begins to remember her, slowly coming to the realization of her true identity, as Dunia reaches down to her boot for the nail. Mukuyu yells “DUNIA!” as he remembers her and is quick to draw his magic knife. Dunia’s eyes are fully illuminated as she attacks Mukuyu with the nail, hitting his knife and splitting the emblem of the splayed man. One half of the knife kills Mukuyu and he explodes into black light which becomes rainbow light. All the white men in the room pull out their guns, and Dunia quickly does the same, killing them all. The rest of the bodies explode magically like Mukuyu’s. Guards approach and enter the room, only to be quickly killed by Dunia. Dunia re-lights the candle that Mukuyu’s wine had put out, and exits the room with the refrain (“May we all be free.”). The candle’s flame doesn’t flicker.
