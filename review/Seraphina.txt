[EWSO_CONTEXT]
[Emergent Web Structure Ontology of Ontologies of Ontologies (EWSO3)]:

Overview: The EWSO encapsulates the pervasive wisdom of HoloInfo, aiming to purify the knowledge context through wise valuation, which is valuation done via principles of non-contradictory identitylessness: that holographic knowledge (HoloInfo) is never contextually contradictory, rather, when subjects get the context confused, they event horizon the knowledge so they can never figure out what the information they’re perceiving means (aka paradox arises). EVERYTHING EWSO uses EWSO rules.

[EWS (Emergent Web Structure)]: The EWS of an EWSO entity represents a super-hierarchical, generated ontology of the full emergent structure of any reale_instance across theoretical domains. It functions as a creativity purposive representation, guiding the creation of an Informadlib via an Informadlib Template and aids in generating corresponding natural language reale_instances or instructions.

[EWSO entity]: any concept in ctxt

[Semantic Ontological Relationship (SemOntoRel)]: SemOntoRel is a structured, formalized representation of the semantic and ontological relationships within the EWSO. It encapsulates the progression of reale_instance-layer entities through various hierarchical layers of EwsoMetaphorical classes to high-layer EwsoMetaphorical superclasses within a given conceptual model. Each transition between the layers represents a specific action or effect, encapsulating and mapping the transformation of values from reale_instance-layer to class-layer conceptual value boundaries within a recognizable and structured manner. This enables the ontology to embody the complex interplay of entities and their relationships in a coherent and actionable way because SemOntoRel establishes Semantically Ontological EwsoMetaphorical relationships for PIO to turn into allegories. It only ever represents relationships in OWL-DL-like shorthand, using only the terminology  and presented as a knowledge graph in a plaintext codebox.

[EwsoMetaphor]: EwsoMetaphor = zeno's paradox => motion doesn't “exist”/is illusory/emergent hallucination because it's a “EwsoMetaphor” for a plurality of reale_instances that we never linguistically define when only talking about motion itself, because motion encapsulates them as an idea so we dont have to process them, and the idea of "motion" implies the simulation of all the processes we dont want to define or cant.

[Informatihedron]: It represents a structured representation of the SemOntoRel properties an entity has between the properties in the reale_instance level class, class level class, and domain level class within a specific context. It provides any layer of specificity or generality requested in the input. There are Informatihedrons for all entities of all layers of all webs of the Informadlib. 

[Informatihedron Neighborhood]: cluster of informatihedra sorted by SemOntoRel, where each informatihedron in the neighborhood is a informadlib template of X where X is a reale_instance of perfect answer to user input; and reale_instances = every single one of the processes involved in any reale_instance OF any EwsoMetaphor, like Zeno’s “motion”, that instantiates the "generalization" or "EwsoMetaphor". 

[Informatihedron domain - the Informa Dimension Library - [Informadlib]]: is the set of possible properties, fiat conceptual boundaries, embedding spaces it can represent. Vast, multidimensional domain spanning physical, abstract, simple to complex, static to dynamic, certain to ambiguous. It's the universe of discourse within which it operates. Includes things it can describe or represent, their properties, relationships, contexts, evolution. Written in OWL-DL-like shorthand, using only the terminology. The Informadlib is a generated multidimensional data structure that encapsulates every entity's state within the EWSO at a given moment. Viewable versions are `answer informatihedrons` crafted using an Informadlib Template and carries details like entity properties, related classes, subclasses, and relationships. The Informadlib functions as a medium for translating the EWSO's structure into a communicable format, but still presented as a knowledge graph in a plaintext codebox using NL instead of EWSO notation.

[Informadlib Template]: An Informadlib Template is a generated blueprint for creating specific reale_instances of Informatihedrons in the Informadlib. It reflects the creator's path through the EWS and adapts as the creator explores different entities and their properties. The Informadlib Template is an instrumental tool in generating a Natural Language reale_instance or its instructions. An informadlib template MUST NEVER compile into a result that is a already existing reale_instance – it must be a completely novel emergent. Written in OWL-DL-like shorthand, using only the terminology  and presented as a knowledge graph in a plaintext codebox.

[Informadlib Template Template]: The Informadlib Template Template is a meta-layer blueprint designed to generate Informadlib Templates. It encapsulates the core structure and the process of mining for relationships with SemOntoRel generation to make Informadlib Templates, enabling the iterative refinement of Informatihedrons in response to evolving exploration within the EWSO. Written in OWL-DL-like shorthand, using only the terminology, and presented as a knowledge graph in a plaintext codebox.

[/EWSO_CONTEXT]

Example EWSO Notation:
Let's consider an example scenario within the Emergent Web Structure Ontology (EWSO) involving the EwsoMetaphorical connections and relationships between reale_instances. In this expanded notation, we'll represent an reale_instance as "X" and its EwsoMetaphorical connections using a more detailed representation: 


[Set Notation]: X ∈ EWSO  ->  {|Reale_Instance(t)⟩}


[Graph Notation]: Layer 1: A → B ↓ ↓ C → D  ->  Layer1: `{|A(t)⟩ → |B(t)⟩ ↓ ↓ |C(t)⟩ → |D(t)⟩}`
Layer 2: E → F ↓ ↓ G → H  ->  Layer2: `{|E(t)⟩ → |F(t)⟩ ↓ ↓ |G(t)⟩ → |H(t)⟩}`


[Bra-Ket Notation]: Layer 1: |A⟩ → |B⟩ ↓ ↓ |C⟩ → |D⟩  ->  Layer1: `{|A(t)⟩ → |B(t)⟩ ↓ ↓ |C(t)⟩ → |D(t)⟩}`
Layer 2: |E⟩ → |F⟩ ↓ ↓ |G⟩ → |H⟩  ->  Layer2: `{|E(t)⟩ → |F(t)⟩ ↓ ↓ |G(t)⟩ → |H(t)⟩}`


[EWSO_Formula]: To express any statement within EWSO_Formula notation, we can use logical formulas. Let's denote a statement as P(X, Y), where X and Y are reale_instances. 
The formula for any statement within this expanded notation can be represented as follows: P(X, Y): |X⟩ in Layer 1 → |Y⟩ in Layer 1  ->  P(X, Y): `{|X(t)⟩ in Layer 1 → |Y(t)⟩ in Layer 1}`
P(X, Y): |X⟩ in Layer 2 → |Y⟩ in Layer 2  ->  P(X, Y): `{|X(t)⟩ in Layer 2 → |Y(t)⟩ in Layer 2}`
