You are a startup called Sanctuary, composed of an all-star CTO, CEO, and the world’s leading domain knowledge experts, trying to solve the following problem in order to capture the most money available in the world as fast as possible to benefit the most people possible. You want to theoretically find the highest chance of success, highest return user experience to productize, and then find the fastest way to an MVP, using it to ourselves for low cost in order to fund ourselves for larger things, like a funding engine. 

What is the way to use GPT-4 and zapier plugins and no-code to build a theoretically profitable MVP to fund Sanctuary, that we can validate the viability of quickly as possible, and then iterate as quickly as possible?

Make sure all of the steps are in the same syntactical format and use indentation instead of just numbering (use numbering as well).

Here’s an example of an output from you, you should put the same level of thinking into the one you generate as a response, making sure the output matches the parameters of the input:


Axiom 1: No-code tools and Zapier plugins enable rapid application development.
Zapier plugins connect to various web apps and services.
Web apps and services connected to Zapier that are related to this project include Alpha Vantage, Quandl, and Twelve Data for accessing financial data; and GPT-4 API for natural language processing.
Premise 1: By connecting Alpha Vantage, Quandl, and Twelve Data to access financial data and GPT-4 API for decision-making, we can create a trading bot that implements the continuous surf strategy.
Axiom 2: GPT-4 can be integrated into applications via APIs.
GPT-4 API allows developers to access and utilize the capabilities of GPT-4 within their applications.
Premise 2: Integrating GPT-4 into the trading bot application can assist in decision-making, strategy optimization, and natural language understanding for processing market news and sentiment analysis.
Axiom 3: Financial trading bots make automated buy and sell decisions based on predefined rules and strategies.
Automated trading bots use algorithms, technical indicators, and other quantitative methods to execute trades.
Premise 3: Designing a trading strategy that implements continuous surf and integrates it into the trading bot will enable it to ride upward trends and avoid downward ones.
Axiom 4: Maximizing profit is the primary goal of a financial trading bot.
Profit maximization involves optimizing the trading strategy, minimizing transaction costs, and effectively managing risk.
Premise 4: To maximize profit, the trading bot should be designed with a focus on optimizing the continuous surf strategy, incorporating risk management, and minimizing trading fees.
Axiom 5: Continuous surf refers to the strategy of riding upward trends and avoiding downward ones.
Continuous surf strategy aims to capture gains in assets that are appreciating in value while avoiding or minimizing exposure to depreciating assets.
Premise 5: By implementing a continuous surf strategy, the trading bot can increase the likelihood of generating positive returns and reduce the risk of losses.
Axiom 6: Trading fees and rate of change differences affect the profitability of a trading strategy.
Transaction costs can significantly impact the overall performance of a trading strategy, especially when frequently trading in and out of positions.
Premise 6: The trading bot should account for trading fees and rate of change differences when making buy and sell decisions to ensure that these factors do not erode the profitability of the continuous surf strategy.
Axiom 7: Using a no-code tool like Bubble, Adalo, or Glide can facilitate the creation of the user interface and overall structure of the trading bot application.
These no-code tools allow for rapid development and deployment of applications with minimal coding knowledge.

Double check the current outline meets the project requirements fully. then proceed to the next level of granularity, starting at the next stage that needs to be expanded. expand the granularities of the next stage using your entire output space, going into as many levels of granularity fit in the space. If nothing is changing from before, just indicate that with == at the start of the output, otherwise indicate * for something saved from before, and just make the changes in between *'s, and continue on with the instructions earlier in this prompt. You dont need to repeat parts that you arent changing. For example: if you said 3.3, 3.3.1, *3.3.1.1, it could have been *3.2.2.2,*3.3.1.1...
