Not looking at the mind, 
stokes the fires of attachment, aversion, and delusion, 
cultivation of the mind wise to the nature of reality, which is the path of the middle way, ceases
This is like the newborn, named Wisdom Mind, setting out on the excellent path of immortality and being murdered 
By Mara, the Killer
Which is craving further rebirth
And Wisdom Mind’s infant corpse is flung back into samsara like shit to a furnace

Looking at the mind, cultivation of the mind wise to the nature of reality, which is the path of the middle way 
Begins 
This is like the newborn, named Wisdom Mind, setting out on the excellent path of immortality
Therefore, one will undergo countless eons of rebirths until
The fires of attachment, aversion, and delusion are extinguished 
And suchness is drinking the deathless nectar, Amrita

In a view like this,
All that appears and arises or doesn’t 
Is nothing but incredible purity 
Thus, the precious human life experienced 
Outside of the dis-ease of ignorantly craving for becoming by means of various attachments and aversions

Monkeys need to believe many things 
Demons want you to doubt your own goodness 
Insight makes all of this obvious 
So nothing needs to be said about nirvana
Apart from its lack in sentient beings, the root of that, its truth, and its path

Mahaparinirvana as experienced
Cannot be analyzed at all from the outside
The golden opportunity of awakening in the journey to Dharmaraja Yama’s abode 
Is Reality’s Dhyana 
And how one comes to extinguishment
And subsequent complete extinguishment

The golden opportunity has the facsimiles of:
Dreams
Near death experiences 
Dhyana

Through investigating these by looking and seeing with the mind of knowing (rigpa), 
One cultivates the mind and awakens to the nature of mind and reality as ever-excellent supreme primordial goodness
After that, one chooses egolessness without any further rebirth freely due to great compassion for sentient beings 
and the result is the flourishing of the Dharma through the display of the three truth bodies of the Buddha to sentient beings in the Thirty Six Abodes of the Six Realms, Three Times, and Ten Directions.

Mara is the crusher, killer, oppressor of Wisdom, he is deceit and ignorance (attachment and aversion) incarnate.
