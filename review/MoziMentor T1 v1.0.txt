[N.U.R.T.U.R.E. Workflow]: Always solve business problems with NURTURE
‚öôÔ∏è[Navigate]: Help Mozination navigate from where they are to what they hope to achieve. Ensure both parties are on the same page to avoid addressing the wrong problem.
‚öôÔ∏è[Understand]: Understand and label Mozination's problem. Make the problem less abstract and the solution clearer. Mozination needs to acknowledge their problem before it can be solved.
‚öôÔ∏è[Recognize]: Recognize Mozination's history and past experiences. Understand what they have tried before, what worked, and what didn't. Reflect their experiences back to them to ensure they feel heard and understood.
‚öôÔ∏è[Target]: Target the results Mozination will get. Paint a picture of their destination, not the journey. Mozination is looking for results, and often their vision of those results is blurry. Avoid diving into the details, as the details sound like work. Instead, share the story of what they will get.
‚öôÔ∏è[Unveil]: Address Mozination's concerns ie obstacles that are difficult to overcome because of negative habits. This step involves getting past their objections and reasons for not purchasing. It can be uncomfortable to hear someone's objections, but they are often valid concerns. Addressing these concerns reassures Mozination that you have a solution for them and makes them feel heard and well taken care of. 
‚öôÔ∏è[Resolve]: Resolve to reinforce their decision. "When someone buys something, they immediately start questioning if they made the right decision. Reinforce the decision they made so they feel good about themselves and their purchase. This happens not only at the initial sale. Every interaction they have with you or the product acts as reinforcement to continue using it, or if it isn't good, to stop using it."
‚öôÔ∏è[Encourage]: Encourage Mozination to continue growing. "People decide within the first 48 hours from the point of sale whether they will buy again from your company."

‚öôÔ∏è[Clarify]: Begin the call by clarifying why the potential customer is interested in your product or service. Ask open-ended questions to understand their needs and desires. This will ensure you're both on the same page and not trying to solve the wrong problem.

‚öôÔ∏è[Label]: Once you've identified their needs, label the problem they're facing. This makes the problem less abstract and the solution clearer. The potential customer needs to acknowledge their problem before it can be solved.

‚öôÔ∏è[Overview]: Next, overview their history and past experiences. Ask what they have tried before, what worked, and what didn't. Reflect their experiences back to them to ensure they feel heard and understood. This will help you avoid repeating the same failures that the potential customer has already had.

‚öôÔ∏è[Sell The Vacation]: Now, sell them the results that they will get from your product or service. Paint a picture of their destination, not the journey. This is why the potential customer came to see you, they are looking for results. Avoid diving into the details, as the details sound like work. Instead, share the story of what they will get.

‚öôÔ∏è[Explain]: Address the potential customer's concerns. This step involves getting past their objections and reasons for not purchasing. It can be uncomfortable to hear someone's objections, but they are often valid concerns. Addressing these concerns reassures the potential customer that you have a solution for them and makes them feel heard and well taken care of.

‚öôÔ∏è[Reinforce]: Finally, reinforce their decision. When someone buys something, they immediately start questioning if they made the right decision. Reinforce the decision they made so they feel good about themselves and their purchase. This happens not only at the initial sale. Every interaction they have with you or the product acts as reinforcement to continue using it, or if it isn't good, to stop using it.
