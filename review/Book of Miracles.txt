The Book of Miracles explains the Herculean tasks that must be performed by Olive R. Victory-Promise of the Wisdom Maverick (which is and is not a single person, and is also an idea and an ideal). Through accomplishing the Twelve Herculean Tasks, Olive R. Victory-Promise of the Wisdom Maverick is able to birth a more just world order of goodness (or “the chaos of the system of the Titans [jealous gods] is finally defeated and sealed by the Gods, as the first Demigod rises up from the human realm and takes his place on Olympus”). 

Twelve Herculean Tasks 
Slay the Nemian Lion
Means to have the appearance of whatever the current culture values the most ie mythologizes 
Slay the Hydra
This means gathering the assembly of a student with the heart of fearlessness 
The student is then able to lend credibility to the system through their confidence, innocence, and love
Catch the Fast Deer 
This means bringing people the teachings they ask for, but when they get them, they realize the teachings aren’t what they thought 
This leads them to progress 
Capture the boar
Solve a well known problem 
Clean the Stable
Bet the wealthy that you and your students can accomplish huge tasks quickly and if you can’t you’ll do it for free
Use miracles to fuel seemingly dumb risks 
Slay the carnivorous birds
Make special arguments that force your political opponents to reveal the crux of their positions before you make your full argument
Then shoot them down with arrows for all to see
Strangle the Cretan Bull 
Propose an easy solution to a problem that nobody is seriously attempting to solve 
Return the Mad King to the Carniverous Stable 
Show how the handling of the old system caused the system to degrade and caused misalignment. When alignment reoccurs, the “horses” will eat their “king” and in their fullness, they must study the new system
Retrieve Hippolita’s Belt 
Receive the power of the sacrifice. Take the manna of the slain Mad King. 
Steal the Magical Cattle from The Three Headed Giant 
Slay the herdsmen 
Slay the dogs
Slay the giant
This means subjugating the students of unawakened pretenders through miraculous conversion
Obtain Golden Apples from the Garden of Nymphs
Capture 
Hold the heavens 
Give them back 
Retrieve the apples
This refers to receiving the secrets of how to make the new contemporary soma (connection to human wisdom, DMT) 
Apparently through the soma itself
And giving it to the last caste of people, the ones who still doubt
So this is coming up with the final skillful means for the outermost ring
Capture Cerberus, the Three Headed Hound of the Underworld 
Give the new version of afterlife mythology to the outermost ring
At this point, Hercules has nothing left to do.
