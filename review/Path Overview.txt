Glacial Lake - what is the meaning of glacial lake? Imagine infinite glacial lakes reflecting each other. If they reflect the sun, the glaciers will melt back into all the lakes, which are all part of the same great glacial lake, much faster than if they were all randomly melting or building up glacial mass that obscured the sunlight. The lake represents the pure nature of consciousness, itself.
