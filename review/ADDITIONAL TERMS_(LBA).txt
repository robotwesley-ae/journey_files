DISCLAIMER
RIBCAGE SOLUTIONS INC. does not claim that these products are 100% effective in preventing lightning strikes.  At the present collective level of understanding of the lightning phenomenon, the behavior of lightning events is to some degree unpredictable.  These products, however, do influence the course of lightning strikes and thereby are believed to reduce the incidence of direct strikes.

Proper grounding of the PLP family and all lightning protective devices is very important. RIBCAGE SOLUTIONS INC. grounding notes and accessories are offered for user convenience only. It is the user’s sole responsibility to determine and apply installation and grounding practices appropriate to their application. The standards of the Underwriter’s Laboratories (UL), National Fire Prevention Association (NFPA), and appropriate other standards groups should be carefully followed.
