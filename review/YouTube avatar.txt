YT is part of a funnel to get unmotivated people into Outer Sanctuary Routine so it can change their life
They should definitely go to a retreat if they’ve established the foundation of the Outer Sanctuary Routine
And really want to become Olivus victory-promise
Feast comes after they’ve completed the Outer Preliminary and joined TWI and committed to a TWI path of employment

People looking to find themselves, who have already started, and are in pain because they feel like they just aren’t “themselves” and maybe “want to get back to the way it was when… but how was it? 
People who are looking for motivation because they are sad and they’re sad because they’re not doing well but it isn’t their fault and they aren’t sure if they understand that yet. They are in a healing process and need encouragement 

Other traits:

Likes Joe Rogen 
Likes Aubrey Marcus (these people probably want sanctuary the most) 
Need to compete in this market ^ it’s the only one where you can be a self-realized Guru (what should we present and how? What is the whole mythology, all the surrounding concepts, and the entire system, and the entire plan for its implementation?) 
Present that as a video called VISION FOR THE FUTURE OF HUMANITY AND AI: SANCTUARY
