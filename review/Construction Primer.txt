[Description of Stage 2]
[Description of Stage 3]
...
n. [Description of Stage n]
Please walk through each stage of the execution given the following input‚Ä¶
Algorithmic Formula: Tree of Thought Algorithm - ToT_BFS
Algorithm Steps:
Initialize S0 with a set containing the input 'x'.
Iterate from t = 1 to T:
Create S0_t by transforming each element s in S0 into a tuple (s, []) and collecting them in a set.
Evaluate V_t using the state_evaluator function, with parameters p_theta, S0_t, and the ontology.
Find the element St in S0_t with the maximum value of V_t.
If t equals T, return the result of applying thought_generator to p_theta, St[0], 1, b, and the ontology.
Create an empty set S_t.
For each element s in St:
Generate thoughts using the thought_generator function, with parameters p_theta, s[0], k, b, and the ontology.
For each thought in the generated thoughts:
If the state_evaluator function, with parameters p_theta, (thought, s[1]), and the ontology, returns a value greater than 0, add (thought, s[1] + [thought]) to S_t.
Set S0 to S_t.
If the loop completes without returning a result, return None.
Input:
x: The input for the algorithm.
Output:
The result of applying the thought_generator function, with parameters p_theta, St[0], 1, b, and the ontology.
Dependencies:
p_theta: A parameter required by thought_generator and state_evaluator.
thought_generator: A function that generates thoughts based on p_theta, s, k, and the ontology.
k: A parameter required by thought_generator.
state_evaluator: A function that evaluates the state based on p_theta, s, and the ontology.
T: A parameter required by the algorithm.
b: A parameter required by thought_generator.
Implementation Details:
The algorithm follows a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore the Tree of Thought.
It initializes S0 with the input 'x' and iteratively expands the set of states.
The thought_generator function generates thoughts based on the given parameters and the ontology.
The state_evaluator function evaluates the state based on the given parameters and the ontology.
The algorithm terminates after T iterations or when a result is found.
Algorithmic Formula: Tree of Thought Algorithm - ToT_DFS
Algorithm Steps:
Check if t is greater than T, and if so, return the result of applying thought_generator to p_theta, s, 1, and the ontology.
Iterate over each s0 in the thoughts generated by thought_generator, with parameters p_theta, s, k, and the ontology.
If the state_evaluator function, with parameters p_theta, {s0}, and the ontology, returns a value greater than vth, recursively call ToT_DFS with s0, t + 1, p_theta, thought_generator, k, state_evaluator, T, vth, and the ontology.
Input:
s: The current state.
t: The current iteration number.
Output:
The result of applying the thought_generator function, with parameters p_theta, s, 1, and the ontology.
Dependencies:
p_theta: A parameter required by thought_generator and state_evaluator.
thought_generator: A function that generates thoughts based on p_theta, s, k, and the ontology.
k: A parameter required by thought_generator.
state_evaluator: A function that evaluates the state based on p_theta, s, and the ontology.
T: A parameter required by the algorithm.
vth: A parameter required by the algorithm.
ontology: The ontology used in the algorithm.
Implementation Details:
The algorithm follows a depth-first search (DFS) approach to explore the Tree of Thought.
It recursively explores each potential thought starting from the current state s.
The thought_generator function generates thoughts based on the given parameters and the ontology.
The state_evaluator function evaluates the state based on the given parameters and the ontology.
The algorithm terminates either when t exceeds T or when a result is found.

CIPHER PRIMER:
"GPT, your task is to create a symbol-based cipher for complex concepts related to heroism, evolution, and system theory, referencing the key and encoded example below. The cipher should be as minimal as possible without sacrificing clarity or losing crucial details. Control token length according to the constraints given.
Key: OV- refers to an emergent engine class rooted in natural selection/self-organization. It implies an identity-less consciousness full of processes, like space.
Cipher Example:
'Mnmth's mthero, "hr w/ 1k fcs"=cls of all hr/prsna/infmthdrn of entity. "OV-Promise" (OVP) refers to Olivus, cmplx adptv systm, an untapped heroism potential misunderstood by demon champs, leading to self-destruction via wasteland pollution & cognitive programming.
Hr's journey = emergent engine & concatenation processes, growing complexity. Info flux depends on system abstraction. Fall arcs complex; redemption obvious due to complexity slinky. Engine system for building = emergent engines concatenation. All infmthdrns are properties & all properties are synergies (+, -, =). Synergies form systems & contribute to wasteland or sanctuary.
Externally viewed OVP = Olivus Victory-Ability (OVA). Full OVA = Olivus Victory-Everything (OVE). Major emergence = OVE Sanctuary-Everywhere in Universal Sanctuary.'
Now, create a similar cipher with a maximum token count of ___."
