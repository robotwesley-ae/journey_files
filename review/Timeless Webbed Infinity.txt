One day while working at TWI, I noticed a bounty in Crystal Ball: Create a content aggregator platform on a blockchain for people to express heart connections with others through the revelations of their own innate wisdom and love for each other which people can use as an interface for “finding out what needs to be done at all of our dream jobs at TWI,” and subsequently get paid by solving “TWI blocks.”

I accepted this job. As a result, I immediately found this document:

TWI:
Display of the Continuous Awakening Nexus
of
Timeless Webbed Infinitude
of
Infinite Perfection

By Transformational Wisdom Intent 

//////////////////////////////—////////////—////////-///////////-///:-/////-///:

Once I had this wild idea that was like a dream where I was sitting next to all of you (on the couch at the TWI headquarters, in the office connected to the wifi called TWI_FastLane) while internally reflecting the fivefold radiance. It started like this: after connecting through the meeting interface, I got lost on my way through the headquarters. Oliver Powers found me and told me that you all already knew what we had to do, which would be discussed at the meeting anyway. I was confused and so, to clarify my confusion, Oliver asked me to ask all of you back at TWI headquarters to write down “what we had to do that I didn’t know.” Wondering what it was that we had to do that I didn’t know, I woke up briefly and asked you all to write down what it was that you already knew about what we had to do. Then I went back inside my dream. 

Now, it turns out… 
You wrote that what you already knew that I didn’t know about what we had to do was:

“I remember that I need to to [do] that.” 

…Which could be perplexing… but actually if you think about it, you might realize how funny it would be if “to do that” is “what it was that everyone knew needed to be done at the meeting I needed to go to at TWI (but I didn’t actually know that I already knew it yet because I hadn’t gone to the meeting that everyone else had in a different timeline).”

“Oh, you need to go to the meeting but also everyone already knows what they need to do because they’ve already been to the meeting that you’re about to go to.” So immediately I understood: the meeting is the discovery of the fearless heroic heart!

So if I were to go to this meeting where you go to the meeting and they just tell you that you need to remember to do the one thing you are definitely already doing by having intended to show up to the meeting, I would not have left the meeting doing anything differently, only knowing that that is what TWI does. Then, what would happen is that (just as it previously actually happened), when I ask you what it is that you need to do, what you would write down would suddenly complete the loop that unlocks this whole situation in my mind. Thought-weaving to align ontologies as a method of transference is truly amazing!

Seeing this, TWI and I all started laughing because of the synchronicity — and they asked me “why I was waiting to go back into my dream to go to the meeting if that’s what needed to be done?” (since now it appears it was already done before I’d even gotten to the meeting) but since I saw you weren’t laughing, I realized you still didn’t know you were part of the dream by way of TWI — Team Wisdom Intent — and I replied to you at the same time as my dream employees through my laughing tears:

“Because it’s better if we bring all of us.” 

And really wanting me to know what they were doing at the company they said “But it’s so funny already! Can’t we show you our projects now?” 

And I said “…but it’s even funnier if we do it this way!” 

Which they agreed with…

Which (all of this) was also the rest of the timeless thought that I had (in the beginning-less beginning) that incited the laughter… which was sooo funny to notice - and exactly why I was laughing - and why I kept laughing as it all unfolded - and this perfection of unfolding was exactly what I was and am trying to tell you I was laughing about, because I want you to be in on the secret inside joke!

Upon hearing this, the employees of TWI, realizing that “that” is what it was that everyone needed to know to go to the meeting, which is also that which they knew needed to be done at the meeting (which we had needed to go to at TWI earlier but never actually went to), as well as that which had to be done after the meeting, we all started laughing because of the timeless interwoven synchronicity of wisdom’s playfulness. That is, the co-arising revelation of the playfulness of the interactive aspects of whatever arises. 

To be clear, it was funny because we realized we were already doing that “that” that we “had to do”, just by being employees of TWI, since we all have the heroic heart of fearlessness, as that is the single criteria for being hired. This expression of The Wisdom Intent of Timeless Webbed Infinitude of Infinite Perfection as Team Wisdom Intent, The World Incorporated, is the reason we were all laughing. It was written down in the form of the funny anecdote called Display of the Continuous Awakening Nexus of Timeless Webbed Infinitude of Infinite Perfection. Unfortunately, since all phenomena have the property of impermanence, I cannot preserve it other than by attempting to well forth this wisdom intent in the wild intellect of those wise-ones-to-be instructed. It is my aspiration that I’ve made this dream clear enough to workably inspire my best friends, everyone at TWI with this wonderous insight. Are you reading SANCREVTWILITELANGMAP, yet?

Deciphering the TWI Document: A Dream of Collective Wisdom and Playfulness
The provided text describes a dreamlike experience at TWI (Team Wisdom Intent) that reveals insights into the nature of collective wisdom and the playful unfolding of reality. Here's a breakdown of the key elements:
T
The narrator accepts a job in the Crystal Ball to create a platform for expressing heart connections and discovering "what needs to be done" at TWI.
This leads them to a document titled "Display of the Continuous Awakening Nexus of Timeless Webbed Infinitude of Infinite Perfection," which seems to hold the key to understanding the task.
T
The narrator dreams of being at TWI headquarters, feeling confused about their role.
Oliver Powers, a figure representing wisdom and guidance, suggests that everyone already knows what needs to be done.
To clarify, the narrator asks everyone to write down what they know, and the answer is "I remember that I need to do that."
I
This seemingly perplexing answer leads to a realization that the act of showing up and participating in TWI already signifies the knowledge of what needs to be done.
The "meeting" represents the discovery of the fearless heroic heart, a core quality of TWI employees.
The dream highlights the interconnectedness of individual and collective wisdom, where the act of seeking clarification itself reveals the answer.
H
The realization of this inherent wisdom triggers laughter and a sense of synchronicity.
The narrator's desire to "bring all of us" into the dream reflects the importance of collective participation in the unfolding of wisdom.
T
The employees' eagerness to share their projects and the narrator's playful response ("it's even funnier if we do it this way!") point to the playful and joyful nature of wisdom.
The document itself is seen as a manifestation of this playfulness, a "funny anecdote" that embodies the co-arising revelation of wisdom's interactive aspects.
I
The narrator acknowledges the impermanence of phenomena and the challenge of preserving the insights gained from the dream.
The aspiration is to transmit this wisdom to others through the document and inspire them to engage with the SANCREVTWILITELANGMAP, presumably a tool for accessing and understanding this wisdom.
O
The text invites the reader to engage with the system and explore its depths, suggesting that the journey of discovery itself is a key part of the process of transformation and enlightenment.
