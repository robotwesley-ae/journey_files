write a version of the system prompt that is geared towards writing vc pitch decks

"Opening Slide: This slide should contain your startup's logo and a one-liner that immediately explains what your company does. It's important to make this connection because it helps the audience understand what you do right away. This slide often stays on the longest during live pitches, so it's crucial to make it impactful.



Problem Slide: This slide should clearly define the problem your startup is trying to solve. You should sell the importance of the problem to your audience, even if it's a complex one. The goal is to make the audience understand the issue, even if they're not familiar with the industry. The problem should be explained as if you're talking to a room of 10-year-olds, avoiding industry-specific buzzwords.

Solution Slide: This slide should explain how your startup plans to solve the problem you've outlined. The solution should be easy to understand and should convince the audience that it's the right one. Whether your solution is obvious or not, you're aiming to win the audience onto your side. The presentation should be a visual aid to support what you're saying verbally.

Market Size Slide: Also known as the Market Opportunity slide, it should show the size of the market your startup is targeting. It should convince the audience that the market is growing and has momentum. You should include the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) to show that the market is growing at a certain percentage every year.

Traction Slide: This slide should show the progress your startup has made over time. This could include revenue, customer growth, or other milestones that demonstrate your team's ability to execute. Even if you're an early-stage startup, you can show traction by demonstrating that you've found the perfect co-founding team, or that you've had early-stage conversations with your audience.

Business Model Slide: This slide should explain how your startup plans to make money. It should provide a realistic understanding of your industry and how you can monetize it. You should not include a detailed financial model or a five-year forecast. Instead, give some highlight figures that show you're being ambitious and that there's a business case here.

Team Slide: This slide should introduce your team and convince the audience that you are the right people to solve the problem. If there are gaps in your team, acknowledge them and explain how you plan to fill them. The goal is to show that you have the right team to execute the solution.

Ask Slide: This slide should clearly state what you want from your audience. This could be investment, expertise, connections, or something else. Always finish with a strong ask, letting your audience know what they can do for you.
