The secret gathering cycle is a process by which founders and civilizations become entangled in emergency flow. 

How best to understand? 

It has only ever been taught experientially 
Those who have gone through it are not known
Because of the way emergent civilization founders are launched into emergency flow

For example, Jesus. 
Jesus is an idea that was created by Jewish pulp writers in around 800-600 BC. It was then resurrected (as an idea) around the year 0 AD by (most likely) the apostles who had created a psychedelic sacrament society and needed a way to refer to the knowledge beyond the great limit at the end of the line.
