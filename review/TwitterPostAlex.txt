ChatGPT is a FREE sales assistant 

But most people don't know how to use it 

That's why I built 100 prompts to learn how to close high ticket clients consistently 

And for the next 24 hours, it's FREE! 

To get it, just:

Sales is the core of business

But most people don’t know how to sell

So they turn to gurus like Alex Hormozi and his CLOSER framework for Grand Slam Offers

But most people don't know how to apply CLOSER framework to their own ideas

Those that do, report to have made a lot of money.

Some people get AIs like ChatGPT to help them with this

But AIs need special training to be able to “use human skills”


And they say this is not currently possible…

So I was surprised when I ended up inventing it…


I made an AI that can use the CLOSER framework in a human way

And now I’m trying to get Alex Hormozi’s attention on Twitter


Because he’s looking for entrepreneurial opportunities to help people, and he has models for selling information


And I can make AIs for every information-based skill

So if he contacts me and makes a revshare deal to sell this AI himself, he can also put part of his profits towards as an angel investment in my company

I’m writing this ad to get traction, so I made a whole suite of AIs

My AIs can do all of this: sales, social media, business analysis, etc.

And for the next 24 hours, 

The first persona in this series is FREE! 

You guessed it - it’s the MASTER CLOSER PERSONA.
