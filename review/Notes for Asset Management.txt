Maybe each ledger update -> export as excel and send to 2nds, they mark whatever is not an asset, used, destroyed, etc, and also take photos of each thing and send back to me
I reconcile transactions and upload photos

Introductory email
Intro email should clearly state that asset hub is required for all
Intro email should give clear instructions to CC the asset manager on all sales conversations with vendors
Canned “INTRO EMAIL”
Overall flowchart of the entire process of asset management from the crew perspective to send them with reminder email
Inviting to Asset Hub
Always invite the HODS and 2nds to AH and assign them this way
Example
BI-WEEKLY Ongoing update emails coinciding with ledger updates
Canned “LEDGER UPDATE EMAIL”
Track down every high ticket asset as it comes in on AH and add photos 
Send individual reminders/talk to people until they put the photos up for each high ticket item
Canned “INDIVIDUAL REMINDER EMAIL”
This is how many transactions you have pending
This is how many reconciled transactions you have that need photos
Automated email filler
Create integration that pulls from Google Sheets and populates the Canned “INDIVIDUAL REMINDER EMAIL” accordingly
See if there is an Asset Hub API that can be integrated to auto-populate the spreadsheet and dynamically update it
Reminder email process
Create spreadsheet titled “PROGRESS_REPORT”
Make rows for pending transactions, photos, and final dispositions
Make columns for each prep, production, and wrap week
	EITHER
Check transactions pending for each department
Mark in spreadsheet
Check assets for photos
High ticket items need photos
Mark in spreadsheet
OR
Use third party integration tools to automate according to 3aii
Halfway reminder
Canned “HALFWAY REMINDER EMAIL”
Two-four week notice
Canned “ASSET WRAP NOTICE EMAIL”
Mtg w each department
Sales convo finalizes plans
Asset unload logistics finalized w Prod Coord
Flow chart
Wrap -> unload logistics to departments
Meet the departments at the unload spot to inventory assets 
Make sure nothing leaves on the truck
Mark the department as returned and bulk update the dispositions of their assets accordingly

Overall notes:

1) Assets + Costumes needs their own process whereby costumes photographs everything that comes in and sends the photos to BOX. 
	Assets can get from BOX and put on AH with info
2) Assets + Set Dec needs their own process whereby Set Dec uploads continuity to BOX and 
Assets can see any items seen on camera that need to be asseted because theyre difficult to replace

Automation notes:
1) Canned emails
2) Chatbot that explains everybody’s role and how to do all of their job lol
