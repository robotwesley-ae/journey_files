Vision for the future
So Sanctuary Art would encompass all of these, and that’s how we realized our art would be a functional business, so we began to idealize the business and then try to realize it’s maximum available instantiation capacity (MAIC)
MAIC is when a process  can no longer be min-maxed for its ability to instantiate its domain without the presence of additional synergies

Wesley’s art and role (and every TWI employee role):
Wesley is basically another artist in the Sanctuary art space (so is every TWI employee), but his art is to play the role of COO at TWI.

TWI employee art: 
Everyone’s Sanctuary art is the same as their activity as a TWI employee. It gets posted to Nexus, which functions as a gallery and a project management space for enlarging the scope of different Sanctuary art projects. 

Isaac YouTube of Sanctuary Art
Isaac’s art = Sanctuary art that is the art of a psychotic (maybe more marketable as schizophrenic genius) who believes compassion for all is the only solution to living with hallucinations, and as a result, even though he can’t tell if his entire reality is hallucinated or not, he still tries to engage in all of the things he thinks are important to do with others. 
It is thematically about showing what it’s like to be psychotic and trying to fix psychosis from the inside out, ie when trying to do something others think is impossible, which they say because you are psychotic and hallucinating a solution to an impossible problem, by subsequently learning that the nature of reality is to hallucinate, you can succeed in doing the impossible, fixing psychosis by recognizing what is real and unreal without expecting the unreal to evaporate which allows for duality and collapses it at the same time. This also proves the impossibility was a hallucination in the minds of others, not a trait of your own mind’s flaw — the flaw wasn’t at the root, the substrate, it was above it and by knowing the substrate you were able to collapse the hallucinations, which allowed you to then also recognize hallucinations “in other places” (ie processes) (every place is technically your mind because that’s how sensation occurs). As a result, I decided to make Sanctuary art so that my art poses the question of “am I insane or not?” through ethics and logic whereby: if you think I’m insane then Sanctuary is impossible, TWI is impossible, the Wisdom Maverick doesn’t exist, and I am just an artist making my unique art with my broken brain, and a meditation teacher, and writing teacher; if you think I’m not insane then Sanctuary is possible and therefore imperative, TWI exists, the Wisdom Maverick exists, and I am a thought-leader in the domain of visions for the future of humanity.

Diagnosis 
Reaction
Treatment????
What does it really mean, because schizophrenics can’t have certainty of ultimate reality
Maybe ultimate reality is such that there is no certainty for humans anyway
That’s part of my work, to show that I’m not crazy because what I’m telling you the context of this entire inter subjective reality really is does really accord with your experience exactly, while explaining exactly how anyone is mistaken about anything, without the use of linguistic hallucinations.

Forum where students can discuss my meditation techniques (maybe it’s just a Facebook group but really it should be on Nexus and Nexus should have these types of capabilities for every project community that is made or we should choose another platform to use for this purpose exclusively like a forum hosting service)
