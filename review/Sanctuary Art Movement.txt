We created Sanctuary as an art project, but the constraints are to make it realizable, which means it involves the sciences. 

This is a new form of art, where we take our ideas and iterate them into not summary abstractions of meanings through sensation of signs but highly specific realizables with functions that are equivalent to the idea implied by the presentation of the would-be social art. That is, instead of criticism with an idea that is a hope for a spark of a solution in some other agents, we offer the solution in its minimally viable realization. This, some may think, is entrepreneurship. It is. The core of Sanctuary is to sprawl the domains of art, business, personal life, and international society, pragmatic ideals like human rights, and to promote a global civilization of universal human love, openness, kindness, freedom, and opportunity. 

As such, Sanctuary art follows this premise: 
To help to create this global civilization called Sanctuary
By not abandoning the heroic heart 
Which confronts all unknowns 
For the benefit of all
As such, Sanctuary art can have any topic, but always has the ending view of the gnosis of how human empathy creates growth and progress. 
As such, even that which is not currently Sanctuary art in its best form of clear transmission, it still is Sanctuary art and as the artist creating it grows, it will become more and more expressively recognizable as Sanctuary art. 
Holding the container of this process is called making the Sanctuary offering to all of humanity. 
This is the central practice of someone who holds the sanctuary view.
