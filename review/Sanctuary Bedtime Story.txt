Sanctuary Bedtime Story

Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved playing with her friends and having fun, but lately she felt like it wasn’t as fun.
This was because her parents fought a lot and she was scared that something was wrong with her. She felt like nobody loved her and she was afraid to be herself.
One night, Lily's parents started fighting again and she felt scared and alone. She closed her eyes and made a wish, "I wish everyone would love each other and play nice." Suddenly, a magical light appeared and she was transported to a place called Sanctuary.
There she met Oliver Powers and Olive R. Love, who welcomed her and showed her around. They told her that Sanctuary was a place where everyone was always kind to each other and that she was always loved. Lily was so happy to be in this world where everyone was nice to each other.
Once in Sanctuary, Lily was put to the test by Oliver Powers and Olive R. Love. They wanted to see if she had truly stabilized the power of her own heart, which would allow her to bring the principles of Sanctuary into her own life. They took her on a journey through the heart of the world, showing her all the love and compassion that was possible, but also the fear and anger that still existed.
Lily was challenged to find a way to balance these conflicting emotions and to show that she had truly understood the power of love and compassion. Through her journey, she met others who were also trying to bring Sanctuary into their own lives, and she learned from their experiences.
In the end, Lily proved that she had truly stabilized the power of her own heart, and Oliver Powers and Olive R. Love dissolved into her, becoming a part of her own being. She woke up back in her own home, but now she was filled with a sense of love and compassion that she had never felt before.
And as she walked through her home, she noticed a change. Her parents were no longer fighting, but instead, they were laughing and playing together. Her best friend was by her side, and they were both filled with happiness and love.
Lily had brought Sanctuary into her own life, and she was proud to be a citizen of this compassionate world. And as she looked around, she realized that the broken home she had once lived in was now a beautiful, loving sanctuary for everyone who lived there.
