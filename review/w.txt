I would like to see progress being made on the TWI community launch: the website, discord, thinkific courses, etc. 

Help devise overall goals for launching the TWI community that will build NEXUS
Help devise and implement the basic community platform 
Help with website and discord UX 
Build community platform by becoming an content creating participant 
Independent content if you want/feel ready 
Devise schedule for content creation via weekly Sanctuary Podcast that we can both host 
Complete hero training program
Help me build hero course training program, which we can sell
By going through it step by step and asking questions (like before)


Notes: I can design the schedule for the training courses
You can become an expert in my system and we can use classic appeal type evasion to build the “body” emanation
Gives us a way to make Sanctuary content that is highly dynamic
