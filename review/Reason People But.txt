When I was a kid I was in car pool because my parents both worked and we lived kind of far away from school and we couldn’t afford a nanny. One time, I don’t remember if it’s because we were late or something had happened, or how it happened, but I got in the car without saying goodbye to my mom. I think I was 6 or so or maybe 7. And as we pulled away I realized I didn’t get to say goodbye to my mom and I started crying and I cried and I cried so much and it was 1998 or whatever so cell phones were super rare… this was not a good way to start a day!!! 

Now, in life we often have many allegorical parents like entertainment, hobbies, and basically any habitual tendency. 

And some of them are positive and some are negative. 

The point is to relate the product to the moment of “Meeting the Goddess” and immediately remind them of their psychological “temptresses” and then make it seem like they’ll be able to win IF AND ONLY IF they get this thing, and then take it away from them with a PRICE TAG. Then add more HELPFUL, RELATED bonuses overcoming obstacles on the path to Dream as you build, 
But also So obvious that GETTING WHAT THEY WANT is SO VALUABLE and THEY NEED IT SO BAD that they actually are BETTER OFF buying the product NO MATTER WHAT, and then give them a no-brained offer where they immediately buy based on value without dropping the price

Back to story: 
… but the driver had a phone. I called my mom, sobbing. “What’s wrong?” “We didn’t get to say goodbye”. She told me she loved me and I said “I love you too, mom.” I went to school. Everything was fine. 

How much do you think I would’ve paid for that connected phone call?
