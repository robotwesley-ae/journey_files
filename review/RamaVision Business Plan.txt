RamaVision business plan

RamaVision will build a retreat center starter kit on its land at 16410 Quail Rd, Abingdon, VA, 24210 to be rented to religious and spiritual organizations. This starter kit will include 1) an event center, 2) a 5 bedroom manufactured home and 3) a storage parking area for residential and non-residential staff use. This will provide a religious or spiritual organization with a solid foundation to work with in providing retreats, workshops, etc. to their members. The retreat center staff will then work to establish campgrounds and additional facilities.

Details:
We are currently obtaining septic and building permits for the above. Once the permits are obtained, we would like to be able to purchase the necessary structures, materials, and labor immediately.
