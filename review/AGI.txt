1. CodeDoctorBrainBrane
From dev -> scope, map dependencies, zip -> github -> trigger file upload to openai -> replace file on CodeDoctorBrainBrane
From live -> send message -> CodeDoctorBrainBrane
Execute Coding Chain -> Xpoll BrainBrane
While coding, eval all code in docker sandbox
If it evals in docker sandbox, add it to program sim docker codebase and then simulate testing code in docker program sim (which is aggregating snippet files for codebase)
When complete, self-zip the project with dependency maps and create coding brainbrane for any new parts
Update CodeDoctorBrainBrane zip

8. Linking JSONs with JSON-LD Ontology Frames
What is JSON-LD? JSON-LD (JSON for Linked Data) is a way to express linked data using JSON. It provides a mechanism to add semantic context and relationships to your JSON objects, making them machine-understandable.
Creating Ontology Frames: For each of your JSON objects (Egregore Profiles, CAWs, etc.), create corresponding JSON-LD ontology frames. These frames will define:
Classes: Represent the types of entities in your system (e.g., AiEgregoreProfile, CascadingAccordionWeb).
Properties: Describe the attributes and relationships of these entities (e.g., hasDomain, hasSubdomains, isPartOf).
Vocabularies: Use standard vocabularies (e.g., Schema.org, Dublin Core, domain-specific ontologies) as well as your own custom terms.
9. Creating a Meta-Ontology
Purpose: A meta-ontology describes the overarching concepts, relationships, and rules governing your entire AI Egregore system. It unifies the individual ontologies you've created.
Content: Your meta-ontology might include classes like "Ontology", "Class", "Property", and relationships like "inheritsFrom", "hasInstance", etc.
Tools: Consider using ontology development tools like Protégé to help you build and visualize your meta-ontology.
10. Building a Python Interpreter
Purpose: The interpreter will translate your ontology structures into executable Python code, essentially bringing your Egregore system to life.
Challenges: This can be complex, as you'll need to map ontological concepts to Python classes, functions, and data structures. Consider potential approaches:
Rule-based: Create rules that translate ontology patterns into Python code snippets.
Library-based: Develop a Python library with pre-defined classes and functions that mirror your ontology.
Hybrid: A combination of rules and a library for flexibility.
11. Encapsulating Implications & Building Programmatically
Function Creation: Once you have a way to generate basic Python code, start encapsulating more complex logic:
Mecha Creation: Write functions like build_mecha() that leverage the ontological definitions to create the necessary components and relationships.
Other Operations: Add functions to manipulate CAWs, execute ToOTs, manage DUOs, and more.
Programmatic Generation: Expand your capabilities to build new components or entire Egregore profiles programmatically based on defined ontologies.

n. Semantic Embedding Analysis (DSPy)
Input/Output Signatures: Define how to represent the inputs and outputs of your AI system as semantic tokens (e.g., using concept embeddings derived from your ontology).
Neo4j Snapshots: Utilize Neo4j, a graph database, to store and query the relationships between your semantic tokens, creating snapshots of the system's reasoning patterns.
Neural Network Training: Instead of a traditional language model, train a neural network (e.g., Graph Neural Network) to:
Identify Patterns: Look for recurring patterns or correlations within the semantic embeddings and Neo4j snapshots.
Heatmap Generation: Visualize areas of high activity or connection density, aiding in understanding the Egregore's reasoning process.
