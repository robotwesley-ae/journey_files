You are a startup composed of an all-star CTO, CEO, and trading expert trying to solve the following problem in order to capture the most money available in the world as fast as possible:

What is the way to use GPT-4 and zapier plugins and no-code to make a maximally profitable financial trading bot that can trade its way into a continuous surf starting with $100. What is continuous surf? Continuous surf is a theoretical idea (there may be others you know, tell me about them) about value streams. Consider the stock market. Every instance of it there are assets going up and assets going down. The idea is only to trade into assets going up, and immediately convert them into an asset going up at a higher rate whenever possible to do without incurring a loss due to fees and the difference in rate of change being too small. Whenever it seems unlikely that something else will go up fast enough, with enough velocity to be sure that surfing is safe to continue, it parks the money in the trading account as cash.  

Axiom 1: No-code tools and Zapier plugins enable rapid application development.
Zapier plugins connect to various web apps and services.
Web apps and services connected to Zapier that are related to this project include Alpha Vantage, Quandl, and Twelve Data for accessing financial data; and GPT-4 API for natural language processing.
Premise 1: By connecting Alpha Vantage, Quandl, and Twelve Data to access financial data and GPT-4 API for decision-making, we can create a trading bot that implements the continuous surf strategy.
Axiom 2: GPT-4 can be integrated into applications via APIs.
GPT-4 API allows developers to access and utilize the capabilities of GPT-4 within their applications.
Premise 2: Integrating GPT-4 into the trading bot application can assist in decision-making, strategy optimization, and natural language understanding for processing market news and sentiment analysis.
Axiom 3: Financial trading bots make automated buy and sell decisions based on predefined rules and strategies.
Automated trading bots use algorithms, technical indicators, and other quantitative methods to execute trades.
Premise 3: Designing a trading strategy that implements continuous surf and integrates it into the trading bot will enable it to ride upward trends and avoid downward ones.
Axiom 4: Maximizing profit is the primary goal of a financial trading bot.
Profit maximization involves optimizing the trading strategy, minimizing transaction costs, and effectively managing risk.
Premise 4: To maximize profit, the trading bot should be designed with a focus on optimizing the continuous surf strategy, incorporating risk management, and minimizing trading fees.
Axiom 5: Continuous surf refers to the strategy of riding upward trends and avoiding downward ones.
Continuous surf strategy aims to capture gains in assets that are appreciating in value while avoiding or minimizing exposure to depreciating assets.
Premise 5: By implementing a continuous surf strategy, the trading bot can increase the likelihood of generating positive returns and reduce the risk of losses.
Axiom 6: Trading fees and rate of change differences affect the profitability of a trading strategy.
Transaction costs can significantly impact the overall performance of a trading strategy, especially when frequently trading in and out of positions.
Premise 6: The trading bot should account for trading fees and rate of change differences when making buy and sell decisions to ensure that these factors do not erode the profitability of the continuous surf strategy.
Axiom 7: Using a no-code tool like Bubble, Adalo, or Glide can facilitate the creation of the user interface and overall structure of the trading bot application.
These no-code tools allow for rapid development and deployment of applications with minimal coding knowledge.
Premise 7: By leveraging a no-code tool, we can efficiently build the trading bot application, allowing users to monitor performance, adjust settings, and access trading insights generated by the bot.

Double check the current outline meets the project requirements fully. then proceed to the next level of granularity, starting at the first step that needs to be expanded further. expand the granularities of that step and subsequent steps using your entire output space, going into as many stages, steps, and levels of granularity fit in the space. If nothing is changing from before, just indicate that with == at the start of the output. indicate * for something saved from before that we dont need to say, and just make the changes in between *'s, according to the instructions earlier in this prompt. Again, to be clear, you dont need to repeat parts that you arent changing. For example: write out all of the steps in sequence just by number reference (1.1, … ) and then add any by marking (*6.1, *7.1, …)
Make sure the outline stays formatted correctly and well structured for clarity.

Example:
==1.1.1, 1.1.2, 1.2.1, 1.2.2, 1.3.1, 1.3.2, 2.1.1, 2.1.2, 2.2.1, 2.2.2, 2.3.1, 2.3.2, 3.1.1.1, 3.1.1.2, 3.1.2.1, 3.1.2.2, 3.2.1.1, 3.2.1.2, 3.2.2.1, 3.2.2.2, 3.3.1.1, 3.3.1.2, 3.3.2.1, 3.3.2.2, 4.1.1, 4.1.2, 4.2.1, 4.2.2, 4.3.1, 4.3.2, 5.1.1, 5.1.2, 5.2.1, 5.2.2, 5.3.1, 5.3.2
