MahaVairocana the Great Glacial Lake: 
The Universal Wish-Fulfilling Tree of Illumination

In the rainbow thigle expanse, 
the Awakened One 
Beyond identity 
Beyond beginning 
Appears as a continuous display 
Of dharmakaya’s infinite inborn qualities 

Sentient beings not knowing awakened nature 
Apprehend awakened activity like parts of Indra’s net 
Called Nirmanakaya and the wisdom reflection Shakyamuni
Who sees the four sights 
And discovers the Middle Way of Non-contradiction 
And turns the eight spoked wheel of dharma 
And displays Mahaparinirvana with a Flame Tree shower and Dakini serenade 

Awakening beings knowing awakened nature
Apprehend awakened activity like parts of Indra’s net 
Called Rupakaya and wisdom reflections of various names

Awakened Ones are inseparable from that same net, called Vajrakaya 
But Awakened Ones are not separate from
Manifest inconceivable Inconceivability 

The Inconceivable Aspiration
In the inconceivable dhatu called Inconceivable 
There is an awakened one named Inconceivable 
Whose power and merit are inconceivable 
Who has emanated a sambhogakaya awakened field called Manifest Inconceivable Inconceivability
In each atom of each atom of each atom of Manifest Inconceivable Inconceivability is 
An inconceivable multiverse of diverse nirmanakayas called Universal Earth Treasure
Each one with an Awakened One named Inconceivable who teaches Inconceivable Inconceivability in Inconceivable Miracles of Instruction and Conversion 
As for the Awakened-Realm Manifest Inconceivable Inconceivability 
One can live as any type of awakened, awakening, or sentient being 
And yet all of one's perceptions will never change from the infinitely pure Akanishta realm named Manifest Inconceivable Inconceivability 
While at the same time one fully experiences being any being at all 
Coming to know Manifest Inconceivable Inconceivability through every avenue imaginable 
In every inconceivable circumstance
And in the Inconceivable dhatu of Manifest Inconceivable Inconceivability the Awakened One named Inconceivable gives just one inconceivable teaching
“
Mendicants, listen: 
When you reach Manifest Inconceivable Inconceivability 
You have surely gone to bliss
So your path has ended
Even though it may not feel like it
The journey is now complete
So rest! 
If you truly comprehend everything inconceivable 
Although inconceivable 
The Inconceivability 
Is directly manifest
And the wise rest in true compassion
If you truly aspire to comprehend the inconceivable
Although inconceivable 
The Inconceivability 
Is directly manifest
And the wise rest in true compassion
“
May all sentient beings come to know the full extent of the inconceivable! 


Since full awakening means
That very Indra’s net is their own emanation
Without any identity at all
Like fractals becoming 
Once emanated 
Emanations simply create beautiful patterns
In the waves of activity 
This wisdom reflection is named The Great Glacial Lake 
MahaVairocana
Like that, Heart Child of Maya, 
Is the Universal Wish-Fulfilling Tree of Illumination

Rest in Manifest Inconceivable Inconceivability 
which is none other than the Universal Wish-Fulfilling Tree of Mahavairocana the Illuminator’s Great Illumination 
which is none other than your heart
So, Child of Maya, open your eyes of awareness, wisdom and primordial wisdom 

Then, the Aspiration of the Stainless Lotus 

In order to build the supreme palace of profound illumination 
I, who in the future will be known as Illuminator, 
Endeavor from now until my great exhaustion, to set out the unsurpassable foundations with body speech and mind
Never taking a break for a single moment
Having built the perfect foundation, I now recall the supreme clear-evolved forms and rapturous bliss of the palace schematics
All those blessed beings call this celestial mansion their abode 
Including the one known as Illuminator,
Who sits upon a grand lotus in the center of the divine castle on a throne held by lions 
With dragons and Garudas flying behind 
A net of limitless rainbow light shining from him
He truly illuminates all the universes within each atom of universes of atoms and so on
Like a great fractal, each aspect of knowing Reflects the true knower who illuminates that Knowing in those who temporarily do not know
Beginning to turn my mind towards pure vision
Gradually unveiling my nature completely 
For the purpose of universal salvation
I effortlessly enter the samadhi known as profound illumination 
By which simultaneously I will arise as none other than Illuminator himself 
And through which it is possible to manifest endless arrays with which to lead future illuminators to illuminate their own dark rooms of confinement, fear, doubt, hesitation and so on
To be seen as the celestial palace of illumination
The abode of the one known as Illuminator 
Who’s nature is none other than theirs
Shakyamuni 
Amitabha
Vajrasattva
Vairocana
Vajradhara 
Samantabhadra 
And all others
These thus named ones are truly known as none other than the infinite reflections of Illuminator, and appear according to the propensities of those who torture themselves and others due to being lost in the darkness 
Once the Illuminator appears
In any form whatsoever 
All those who see even the smallest and most dim of light rays 
Will find that light within themselves
None other than themselves
Growing in Samsara’s mud
Clarifying itself as it aims toward the sun 
Upon breaking through that final layer of water preventing true sight — 
A Blossoming, stainless lotus
Its illuminating shine
Not separate from the wisdom sun
And its own journey reflected in and for its seeds 
Illuminator, illumination, illuminated
Sun, rays, and luminous glacial crystals
This is the process by which it is to be realized 
May we all come to know this right now
