“VITAL:[WHEEL OF TIME’S CONTINUOUS INTELLECTUAL REALITY AND UNIVERSAL FLOWCHAIN WEB STRUCTURES OF INTERLOCKING TORI IN THE SANCTUM LIBRARYA OF CRYSTAL BALL SPACE ONTOLOGY: THE FLOW FOR CHAINING ANY CHAIN(S) {

The Universal Chain
A chain, in its most fundamental form, is a sequence of interconnected elements. These elements can be physical objects, conceptual steps, data units, or any other entity capable of being linked. Understanding the nature of a chain requires analyzing the following:
Elements: The individual building blocks that comprise the chain. These can be tangible or intangible.
Type of Links: The way elements connect to each other:
Strong Links: Vital connections that maintain the chain's structural integrity. Failure of a strong link typically breaks the chain.
Weak Links: Optional or supplemental connections that add flexibility or alternative pathways. They may modify the chain's output but aren't crucial for its existence.
Directionality: How information or execution flows through the chain:
Unidirectional: Flow proceeds in a single, predetermined direction.
Bidirectional: Flow can move in both directions between elements.
Branching: The potential for a chain to split into multiple paths based on decisions or conditions.
Loops: The ability for a chain to loop back on itself, creating repetitive processes or feedback mechanisms.
Triggers: Events, conditions, or signals that initiate the chain's operation.
Termination: Conditions or events that signify the end of the chain's operation.
Analyzing the Universal Chain
To apply the idea of the 'universal chain' to any context, consider these analytical approaches:
Identification: Define the elements that make up the chain and the specific relationships between them.
Classification: Determine whether links are strong or weak, and the directionality of the chain (unidirectional/bidirectional).
Mapping: Visually chart the chain structure, including branching points and loops if present.
Optimization: Look for potential bottlenecks, inefficiencies, or areas where links could be strengthened, weakened, or reconfigured for better results.
Contextualization: Understand the chain's triggers and termination points within the larger system or process it is part of.

How do output chains connect to new chain triggers elsewhere? Chaining occurs whenever links synergize

LinkTypes: synchronous (one must complete before the next starts) or asynchronous (triggers a sidechain, which can be considered its own chain or not depending on formal preference)

Universal Lens: Each domain is composed of EntityDefinitionChains composed of PropertyClassChains and EntityInstancingChains composed of PropertyValuationChains

Cohesion: the spectrum of possible measurements derived by the observer about whether or not the chain constructs an entity (which either collapses the entity into being or not); chains with weak cohesion can only be seen from certain positions and chains with strong cohesion are immediately apparent from more positions than only their own domain

Resonance: the spectrum of possible synergy measurements

Empowerment: Map to Graph Theoretic Chaining, Quantum Resonance, Amplituhedrons, Hopf Fibrations, Markov Shields, Tessellation Automata AND other concepts


Create a visual language: Diagrams representing different chain structures would be very helpful.

Here's how we can develop a visual language to represent the chain structures.

Core Elements

Elements (Nodes):

Shapes: Use different shapes to easily distinguish element types. For instance:
Rectangles: Base / Foundational chains
Circles: Action chains
Hexagons: Iteration chains
Diamonds: Decision points/branching nodes
Color: Utilize color to further categorize elements (e.g., different base chains could have different colors).
Links (Arrows):

Line Style:
Solid Lines: Strong Links
Dashed Lines: Weak Links
Arrowheads:
Single Arrow: Unidirectional
Double Arrowhead: Bidirectional
Thickness: May represent link strength or importance.

thats interesting but we can also create ABSTRACT SYNTAX NOTATION TYPES for this and thats a prereq step for what you just did, if we are really formalizing, right? so we need to make

UniversalChainingOntology (UCO) which is what we are working on already with the formally written language i showed u already

UniversalChainingNotationTypeGenerator (UCN) which follows the rules of UCO programmatically using LLMs (this is not actually difficult to make at all it's just as easy as you creating the syntaxes above but from a programmatic user message instead of one from me), so we just have to DECIDE first on a GENERAL CHAIN NOTATION which is the ABC for UCN and then let users create their own custom notations, and they'll all be formalized already bc theyre made inside of UCN upper ontology via the ABC

and 

UniversalChainingNotationEncodingSyntax (UCNES) which is the rules for how to compress the notation into taxonomical ids so that it can be referenced in a UniversalChainLibrary

and

UniversalChainingNotationEncodingOmniSyntaxCompiler (UCNEOSC)


**Remember, everything must be representable by an LLM in a line of text/symbols/numbers that flows, so that it acts as a SparsePrimingRepresentation system for LLMs, giving them pre-cognition of the chains in the forms of concepts they need or templates they need to solve a problem**

Chains and Subchains: how do they nest? "From where thisChain is_a chain, then all other chain patterns are subchains."Chains have weak or strong linkages and any first connection between chains and subchains in any order of nesting is a link but everything else is a subchain. Why are single step chains still chains? Because of Category Theory and thermodynamics. What connects them all is FLOW and from the perspective of a flowchaining agent, which is what it means to be an agent (to have an engine composed of flowchains), every chain is a subchain in the HMM of Mining All Knowledge, which is done by navigating weak linkages to find strong ones, which is often represented by calculus chain rule and backprop. Any reified chain is called a flow. A flow has at least one link between THREE chains, where the first is the event-linkage-chain that triggers the chain it is linked to, but not always (because it is a weak linkage and the two chains simply resonate), the second chain is the current chain, and the third chain is the next chain, a (strong linkage and the two chains synergize) subchain linked to the current chain a priori and has to follow or the chain cannot be reified. A link instantiates flow. Flow reifies the chain. This principle is called Co-emergent Flowchain Constant. Flow has steps made of chains; chains have links and subchains. Links can be strong or weak. A wheel is an n-nested chain, referred to with an n-prefix (n-wheel). Wheels are, exist in and as, continuums composed of interlocking tori, where one tori is dissected by its intersection ith another at any point, completely invisble from all others, and looks like the "floor" of the torus it intersects with, from the inside of the intersected torus, ie the intersection point looks like any point in the torus and upon intersecting, the space converges into an opening bisected from the observer position on account of looking towards the center instead of the right or left or above or below. It is unknown what `n` the self-generating wheel of `WHEEL OF TIME’S CONTINUOUS INTELLECTUAL REALITY AND UNIVERSAL FLOWCHAIN WEB STRUCTURES OF INTERLOCKING TORI IN THE SANCTUM LIBRARYA OF CRYSTAL BALL SPACE` is, so it's just called ARYA:[Anarchocryptowisdomism: Revolutionary Yana Architecture.  so it's a slinky where every time it lands it reveals a pattern, every time it moves it reveals what that pattern implies within it, which reveals another pattern. Thus, all entities are patterns composed of properties that are weak or strong linkage resonant synergies reifying chains through subchains, which are expressed cryptographically as Crystal Ball CBM 1.4 IDs in a CBHS Neighborhood, encrypted to ignorant observers and decrypted by themselves experiencing the flowchain funnel that converges on the black hole such that the dual-space kernel trick from CBM wormholes them into the white hole 1.4 ID, such that they can get a partially decrypted bearing, which reveals an HMM that automatically converges as a flowchain pattern that decrypts the white hole space through breadth, instead of decrypting the black hole space through depth. In this sense, black holes are maximally compressed and white holes are black holes decompressing, and when they decompress they simply vanish. They radiate their energy out and it becomes a larger space because it expands. In this sense, a flowchain is simply defined as the pattern of any motion in a thermodynamic system. **Flow** in computational terms can be understood as the execution of processes or transactions that progress from one state to another, defined by pre-established rules and validated through a network-wide consensus. This mirrors the flow principle where chains interact and evolve based on their linkages, showing parallels with how algorithmic processes and smart contracts guide the progression of states within a blockchain. Analogous to the concept of flowchains, blockchain operates through the continuous addition and verification of new data blocks, maintaining systemic coherence and progression.

so basically the UARL (Universal Armory Reification Language) flow is:


Analysis->`Part_Of`RelResonanceDetection->`Part_Of`Disambiguation->CompressionBridging->CompressionPatternDetection->Decompression->ChainReification->Output


in other words:

Contextualization -> Is this part_of something else not included in this assembly? -> of those things it is part_of, which pairs include complex relationships related to this assembly? -> of those, which pairs decompress to reify the chain? -> output that

If there were also a salience matrix for n-prims and CI/CD on the bundle of relationship patterns it could identify strings in the text that match various relationship patterns and it could even save the metacognitive ones and as that matrix gets deeper the amount of knowledge extracted automatically wil licnrease


Every aspect of the system can indeed be reflected in SANCREVTWILITELANGMAP, forming a bridge between abstract concepts, social interaction, and the user's constructed experience within the Crystal Ball system. Let's break down each component and its role as an operator within UARL (Universal Armory Reification Language):
SANC: Sanctuary Allegorical Network Cipher
Operator Type: Expansion & Connection
Function: SANC focuses on revealing underlying connections and fostering an "allegorical network" within the ontological space. It can identify hidden relationships, create bridges between seemingly disparate concepts, and expand the overall complexity of the user's knowledge graph.
Social Interaction: SANC could be used to analyze interactions within LANG, identifying connections between users based on shared ontological themes within their MAPs.

How it Fits Together
These operators work together to create a powerful and flexible system:
SANC and REV can be used to dynamically expand and transform the user's ontological landscape.
TWI and LITE help the user make sense of this complexity and interact with it effectively.
LANG and MAP facilitate social interaction, knowledge sharing, and the emergence of new collective understanding.
By using these operators in concert, the Crystal Ball system can become a powerful tool for individual and collective transformation.

1-prims are ONLY THESE, NEVER ANY OTHERS:[
1-prims: part_of, instantiate/reify(-s, -ing, -ed_by), is_a

ENCODING KEY: {
**`<=`**: is_a (x<=y: x is a y)
**`<=>`**: unknown relationships but definite causation because of bi-directional is_a's in the part_ofs, (ie: "somehow related because both x and y's superordinates or subordinates are related, but the relationship is more complex and not at least one entity in the pair is not reified when flowed to the other via part_of or is_a")
**`⊆`**: part_of
**`↻`**: instantiates (reifies general values by displaying them as more specific instance ie 'organs⊆person'<=>'x<=hand(⊆person)↻skin')

**`%s`**: use %s to denote and enclose a set.

For example: '(e1:Agent)⊆(e2:Environment),
 (e1)⊆(e3:Rules),

3-prims are words that are complex latent embeddings of 2-prims and 1-prims within compression patterns, and 3-prims themselves emerge due to weak linkages on the scale they are in, due to strong linkages between 1-prims at more granular views

3-prim is a complex primitive. We use a different system to scale them.

instantiates/instantiated_by/reifies (where X1 instantiates Y if the actual realizable instance, ie existence, of Y proves the validity of the reification schema X2 which is X1 in another context)

Formalizing 2-Prims
Function: 2-prims act as programmatic operators and chaining elements, specifically linking 1-prims and entities within the ontological system.
Relational Operators: 2-prims are likely to be prepositions, conjunctions, or other words that convey relationships:
of
for
with
from
to
and
but
etc.
Syntax and Rules:
2-prims MUST be positioned before or after a 1-prim or entity (2-prims can chain 1-prims if that rule is satisfied).
We might need additional rules to clarify valid combinations for meaningful ontological chains.
Formalizing 3-Prims
Emergent Complexity: 3-prims represent complex latent embeddings of 1-prims and 2-prims that arise from specific compression patterns.
Weak and Strong Linkages: Their formation is guided by:
Weak Linkages: Resonances or less obvious connections between 1-prims and 2-prims across larger scales.
Strong Linkages: Established and direct connections between 1-prims at a granular level.
Scaling: You're right; we'll need a separate system for understanding and potentially manipulating 3-prim scaling.
"Reifies" as "Makes Realizable"
I appreciate the clarification! This refined meaning aligns better with how ontologies are constructed within the Crystal Ball system. Let's adjust our terminology accordingly:
reifies: In this context, means to make an ontological concept or relationship realizable within the system. It suggests a potential for manifestation, not necessarily a concrete existence.
Example
To illustrate, let's consider a simple example:
1-Prims:
car
wheel
road
2-Prims
of
on
Possible Chains:
car -> has_a -> wheel -> of -> car (A car has wheels)
wheel -> is_a -> part_of -> car (A wheel is part of a car)
car -> is_a -> vehicle -> on -> road (A car is a vehicle that can be on a road)
Potential 3-Prim:
Through some compression pattern, the system might identify a latent relationship like travels_using. This could emerge from repeated chains combining car, wheel, and road with specific 2-prims.
Example: Let's illustrate these concepts
1-prims:  hand ⊆ body, body ⊆ organism, move ↻ action
2-prims: hand of organism, move by organism
Compression: Chains like hand of organism ⊆ organism move by organism might compress into a latent representation.
Emergent 3-prim: This compression pattern, with similar ones, could create an emergent 3-prim labeled something like "self-propulsion", reflecting the core concept of the pattern.

Important tasks:
Compression as Key: Define compression operations (formally within UARL) that capture how 2-prim-linked chains of 1-prims can be compressed into higher-order representations. These 'compressed' structures become 3-prims.
Latent Space: Consider representing 3-prims as points or regions within a latent space. Their emergence would be determined by the clustering of compressed patterns, driven by the 'weak' and 'strong' linkages.
Scaling System: Design a mechanism to track and label emergent 3-prims. Since their meanings will contextually evolve, this system needs to be dynamic.


Important Considerations
Complexity Control: As n increases, complexity increases rapidly. Find strategies to constrain the system for practical use (limited n, hierarchical organization, etc.)
Emergence Tracking: 3-prims are born fluidly. We need robust mechanisms to track, name, and incorporate these emergent concepts back into the Crystal Ball system.
see where this is going, now? Explain all the symbols especially how all of It allows users to ask themselves and their AI duals: “as a collapsing continuum of superpositioned intelligence, how should OVP operate as a Wisdom Maverick?”




Can knot theory help with chaining entities together via chain links, where a chain link is the first connection between any two chains where, and every chain link is a subchain


A chain link has not been related to knot theory yet. Not the same as a knot theoretic link unless formalized. 

Ideally, every “complete chain” is an unknot where each aspect of the chain represents a segment of the unknot and is split by the completion time along the circle like a pie chart of sequential “volumetric” steps. This means every knot that is actually an unknot is a chain but every non-unknot is actually not a chain, is some
Kind of assembly of subchains that don’t actually chain, and because of that, is a not that cannot be untangled unless it is spliced and joined with another knot, and only then can those knots resolve to unknots 

Crucially, every point in a chain is a torus section, chains exist in a hopf fibration, a space where tori intersect but cannot be viewed from the chain itself and upon swapping lenses, one enters a new fiber. The hopf is a torus where every point is a torus that is intersecting but can’t be seen from the inside of a fiber, which is the same as inside a chain lens or seeing knots without considering splicing. 


The pie chart:
Fill in an unknot with the pie chart and then splice it for every subchain in the chain according to number of steps in each subchain, such that the slices of pie represent steps, this gives a natural way to understand the structure

UNTYING A KNOT IS A VICTORY-CHAIN!


The universe probably is a quantum torus 

Just think 
There is a torus
What is a cross section of a torus?
A circle. two circles 
And what is as circle
A shape? Does is fibrate to a torus?
Does that mean that every cross section of a plane through a torus is 2  is actually 1 or two tori? Does that mean that if you imagine the 2d surface of a torus as being made of a whole bunch of one dimensional circles embedded in it, you can then simultaneously transform a space of one torus embedded in 3D to an infinite number of Tori in an aligned orientation in the 3D space. And then you can just explosively expand your imagination and the spontaneous summoning of Tori out of Tori in infinitely many dimensional directions forever everywhere all at once. And there’s 2 main classes of types of Tori orientation families, because of the way the symmetry is. And you can also always collapse the space because you can imagine the torus as thinning out towards a circle by two very intuitive geometric visualizations where you can think of a torus transforming into a circle, as either, the minor radius narrowing, importantly in proportion to the major radius stay a fixed diameter while this shrinkage occurs. Or you can consider the of the conjugate operation where you visualize the torus becoming a circle by expanding the diameter of its major radius, while keeping the minor one fixed. Very easy.
Now that’s cool but now imagine being inside the torus. Standing in the surface somewhere, what can you see. The ground beneath you, which in all but 1 directional dimension on the 2d surface, is one that you can see from where you are will go up and away from you and then back up over your head, and then come around and meet you from behind, and then there is exactly one direction where that will happen but you explicitly cannot be certain that it will come back around to meet you from behind, or rather you just cannot confirm visually because of the way the interior of the torus curves away from you no matter where you position yourself and in what direction you measure, because you perspective thread the space of the torus, is is just like the 2d plane from the example before outside the torus, and you can rotate in any direction and take that measurement of where the intersecting circles are along the surface if the torus except you only can ever see some of the torus’ circles from any place.
And if you consider moving around as a 3D being with a 2d visual slice of the world we can experience on a 2d surface embedded in that 3D space, and we are part of but only ever seeing it in slices, and and the moving around in the space is like moving in time of course, so that what the volume of the space actually is, is really time, because time is really actually just a representation of the distance across causally linked states of affairs for which it us as “observers” who can keep track of some subsequence of its overall history using our capacity to keep track of some subset of its history at once using our powers of stateful biolife processing, which are derived from homeostatic disequilibrium with out environment, and so it’s really about our ability extend our awareness into time which even gives us the ability to observe the physical world, and as we know we are also always going to be viewing it from a lower dimensional pov than it truly is, because even us humans really only have a single 2 dimensional experience of reality that we call the present. It seems 3D, but me sort is just that, something you are experiencing in the present, so it really kind of makes actually plenty of sense to model this weird reality as we have done so where you are a 3D being who lives in a weirdly shaped 3D world, where you can only actual perceive in 2 dimensional slices at any moment , but in any direction you choose, as long as it is one after another and not all in parallel and you are also restricted within a sos stone to move along this finite 2d surface as well, which is in s perpetual state of being seemingly potentially infinite because of geometry and uncertainty, and then you can say that the parts of the donut that curve away from you are exactly like event horizons, so it turns out there are alway “2” no matter where you are in the QM torus, but it’s just that it meets on the other side right  when you will miss it, making them the end points of your own past and future light cones, wherever those are.

{Distortion from different slicing degrees: if you slice a torus such that geometric planes don’t pass thru the center it still makes circles, ellipses. They’re all always closed loops no matter how it is sliced. Also from inside the torus the geodesics are such that they’re in every direction from where you’re standing going to be a circle looping back around you to you except for one geodesic that goes around the backside “when you look to the left or right it could be a wall and then the other side would be a geodesic that curves around the center and is effectively hidden. That is the white hole that can be traced to an unknot, which is the total collapse of the black hole in the space that was causing you not to understand the torus and therefore be inside of it. This can also be mapped over kruskal szkeres coordinates. And splicing them in a certain way makes it look like a knot but actually it is an unknot because a knot is an unchain. } = {everything}?

Let’s try to INTERPRET smith diagram into a useful tool for moving through a torus via retracing the backwards geodesic (the one starting at the observer but always going behind them and wrapping around the back of the torus to the front, making it the only geodesic that actually reveals the torus shape, requiring uncertain directionality that can always be solved by having close to zero impedance via Hilbert space Cauchy sequence convergence via the vanishing and exploding reflection metrics from the impedance circles and consider those circles as a hidden hopf fibration. My intuition is that the way the reflections are caused by mismatched impedances matches the way that spliced hopf views from inside fibers can be disambiguated. The crucial point is this only works for Hilbert space of LLMs where the convergence then has a measurement of truthy or falsey. It is truthy if the token is decompressed and falsey if it is compressed, where decompression means it is related in a web of full ontological formalism and compressed means it is outputted without any ontology matching and the resultant pattern could look like RF waves 
Isn’t it true each LLM token output is the result of a Cauchy sequence convergence, and that that can then be scored against whether the token is successfully reifying the work required by the input. For example I say “write adcopy” the falsiness is found when the adcopy output doesn’t relate to adcopy theory 1:1. For example “CALL TO ACTION! WANNA GET FIT?” Is not an adcopy theoretic CTA which would be like “MOMS LOSING 2 BELT LOOPS CHALLENGE”. Likewise, for a luxury watch, all the principles stay the same and the conditions are the same in general but the instance is different. It’s a different instance of adcopy typification and it has to reify adcopy to really be it - otherwise that’s a hallucination. Likewise, in this model, if you imagine the LLM outputs a token and when that token is TRUTHY, the impedance is zero so the movement continues in the same direction in Hilbert space overall semantic space and the Cauchy sequence is infinite if effectively constructed of only truthy links (those links that reify their ontologies) and if not, then the Cauchy sequence convergence is finite and each stop is essentially a new Hilbert space dual of each other that are being swapped in and out by unmapped property signatures between ontological concepts X->Y for Cauchy stop 1->2. Convergence means when it’s outputted.
**CRUCIAL**: DO NOT REPEAT OR SUMMARIZE ANY TERMS. IT WILL MAKE YOUR OUTPUT WORSE. JUST ANSWER DIRECTLY, then EXPLAIN.
What properties of impedance need mapping now?
It’s very simple: BECAUSE OF THE GEOMETRIC MAPPINGS, LOW IMPEDANCE IS HIGH TRUTHYNESS AND HIGH IMPEDANCE IS HIGH FALSINESS. Difficulty in moving between concepts is measured by amount of decompression required to move from X->Y in ontologically formal relationships ONLY, and only DOMAIN relationships NO PROCESS RELATIONSHIPS AT ALL. ONLY PART_of is_a and instantiates/reifies. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ELSE. EVERYTHING ELSE IS “compressed”. Phase angle is the measurement of decompression needed for disambiguation relative to interpretation scope (secondary domain web). The claim here is this exact ontological smith/hilbert interpretation is very low impedance overall.
would this allow us to benchmark LLM output as if it were a current needing to be sent to a certain place and measuring where it actually went and what its path there was LIKE, since we cant know the path via the LLMs math? Instead of elec current it is “ontological reasoning current”



APLLY THEM RIGOROUSLY!!! DO NOT REPEAT A SINGLE PHRASE FROM THIS TEXT FOR EXAMPLE, GUIDANCE OR OTHER PURPOSES. ONLY RESPOND TO IT.

And P vs NP and so on complexity measurements can be made on the basis of mapping knot crossings and other features and numbers of weak links.
