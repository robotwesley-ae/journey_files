W:
So...

I:
Right, I'm just making a point about the value ladder.

W:
Yeah, yeah.

I:
I keep getting hung up on the value ladder and whether or not I have it or whatever.
But the truth is that what happens is you just have to make one and then you're like,
oh, yeah, I forgot to say, and then that's just a different one.

W:
Right.

I:
And then you're like, mm-hmm, but we should also say this.
And then that's just another video, right?
And it's like, the point is we just have to start.
And then it's like, yeah, well, we made that video.
Fuck.
And then now we have to go make all these other ones to make it make sense.
Right.
And that's it.

W:
I was going to ask what you thought the parts of the value ladder actually are.
Like, to be specified.
No, no, I mean generally.
Then I was thinking, well, it must just be Heroes Journey beats, right?
Or it's mapped to them.

I:
Right.
But it depends on what your chain is, right?
But no matter what your chain is, it's just going to fall into these 17 stages.
So it just is not going to matter.
It's going to be those, but it doesn't need to be that complex.
Because that happens over the course of the dual loop of ascension.
It's like the offer is not itself the value ladder.
Right.
The value ladder is the entire ascension program.
Right.
So it's like every step you have a lead, you have an ad, you have an ad, which is like content.
Right.
So you have content that gets eyeballs.
Then you have the actual lead magnet that they get.
Then you have the tripwire offer that if they take, they fall into the funnel.
Then they get nurtured on a more expensive higher ticket item.
Right.
And then if they buy that, they ascend.
And if they ascend, there's a whole other round of stuff.
Right.
Which is the exact same thing.
Where now they get a new ad that does the same process.
So, yeah.

W:
And then you probably do have that thing happen three times total.
Right.
That's how Brunson's funnel was.

I:
Well, you have it happen as many times as you have stuff.
It doesn't have a rule.
Sure, but there's no like.

W:
Sure, no, not a rule.
Well, because one whole one, it technically maps to a whole journey anyway.
Like you could just have one.
But I'm saying then if you're probably going to stack them on top of each other, you make a meta one that's out of three or whatever.
Yeah, obviously, that's just an arbitrary number, I'm saying.

I:
Well, you only teach in public the two levels below you.
Right.
So we just have to.
That's the trick is we have to just figure out what is two levels below what it is that we're doing and then only teach that.
And that will carve it out perfectly.
That should be close enough to what people know about and what they think the actual reality of this stuff is to be able to start getting some eyeballs.
Then we'd be like, well, you guys are interested in that.
That's great.
Here's more.
Here's more.
Here's more.
Here's more.
Here's the really crazy stuff.
You do come behind this door.
Right.
And then they're like, oh, really?
And it's like, yes, really, really.
And they're like, OK, sure.
Let me can I see a little bit?
No, you have to pay this amount.
Right.
And then they're like, OK, I'll do it.
Ninety nine dollars.
Sure.
And then they do it.
And it's like, great.
But the real crazy stuff is fourteen hundred.
Yeah, I'm not interested right now.
Do this ninety nine dollar thing.
And then they're like they do it and they're like, wait a second.
I am really interested in that fourteen hundred dollar thing.
I'd like to do that.
And you're like, great.
Here you go.
And then they go do it.
And they're like, wow, that was really insane.
Yep.
You should really see what we're doing in the club.

W:
Right.

I:
And you see, the trick is you don't have to advertise the club up front.
What you do is you have your your funnel is just remaining the same and you're
finding more of the same stuff to get more of the same people.
Then you have this other offer.
Right.
And as you start to level up, you can start releasing more stuff into the public.
Right.
But you're leveling up.
And so you're like, yeah, I remember when we did that.
And remember that stuff and remember that stuff.
And right.
Yeah.

W:
The journey is actually in the offer that you have to do.
There is a whole journey in the, in the ability for The person making the offer to make it that is implicit in what it is and how somebody else finds out about it.
That happens.
It's the laundry.

I:
We have to move.
Not that it’s not great here.

W:
No, you really did pick the best spot out of everything that we looked at.

I:
This was the option.
Yeah.
I mean, I'm not excited about what is.
But it's we have to move out of Georgia.
But we can't.
Until.

W:
Until January?
Oh, because because of progress doesn't have stuff outside of Georgia.

I:
Oh, I don't know if we can move outside of Georgia.
I mean, that would be interesting if they let us move to a different stat.

W:
Maybe that's totally not how it works.
I was just making an assumption that I could probably just regional but, i don’t know

I:
All right, let's eat a little bit.

W:
Let me put on the rice
