Intercept Lightning Protection LLC hereby declares this lightning protection system inspected and approved and the object in consideration protected if the above 10-point checklist is filled out with 100% yeses, as well as that the inspected LPS will be in compliance with the minimum standards set forth by NFPA 780 and LPI-175. While the object in consideration may not be classified as a “structure” as written by NFPA 780, and thus some requirements may not be applicable, it is our professional and expert opinion that the proper completion of the above checklist ensures the same amount of protection as would be certifiably gained through following the standard criteria of NFPA 780 and LPI-175 required for “lightning protection for structures.” This declaration serves to certify the installation has been properly installed and substantially reduces or mitigates the risks associated with the occurrence of lightning attachment to the object in the zone of protection of the LPS.
