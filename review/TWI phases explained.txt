Phase 1 is manual operation of the precursor system that doesn’t have a blockchain 

- we will issue a round of investor tokens called manifestation tokens that people can buy (NFTs) and then in phase 2 these will become worth a lot of money 

- we will have a discord server. When you submit your “Hero Application” you get access to the discord in the form of a NFT of your application. 

- your application’s aspirations are uploaded to the aggregator

- we will also have a directory of project and aspiration links searchable through the aggregator, operating on the data-linkages between projects,  aspirations, people, and skill sets

- we will have 5 or 6 explainer videos pinned to the aggregator to explain Nexus, TWI, and Glacial Lake. 

- at this point, we will register as a decentralized altruistic start-up state 

- with all of that functionality, we should be able to grow the community 

- with the community growing, we can either get funding or crowdsource our labor for phase 2 

Phase 2 

- release full Glacial Lake Hero Orientation course 

- get more funding through releasing more tokens (previous investors will be able to sell a new investor the tokens they bought, if they want to exit) 

- developing the actual blockchain

- developing the actual algorithms and features for the  mobile app 

- releasing the fully functional prototype 

- influence campaign 

- public app launch 

Phase 3

- increased marketing and influence campaigns 

- IPO 

Phase 4

- sustainable operation as mass adoption occurs



Q&A

The ROI just depends on the rate of growth of the community, which really depends on us getting started and having the capital to ramp it up fast and organically. What we are doing is making an infinitely scalable idea that relies on humans wanting to make the world a better place, and slowly replacing all of society with the NEXUS, then taking a cut of that, which is part of the sustainability of the network. 

So it follows that any investor will need to be forcefully exited at one point or another. There is a limited ROI from TWI shares themselves and NEXUS. HOWEVER, the reason this doesn’t matter is because once you have benefitted enough from the infinite pool of self-emergent value called NEXUS, you will have created your own “aspiration/intention/project” community on NEXUS (similar to becoming a social media influencer in this day and age) where your community members are start-up projects that make money for you. 

Those start-ups are founded from emerging trends of NEXUS’ aspirations, the intersection of pain points people experience and solutions others have already found but not yet monetized. This is why it is “saving the world THROUGH BEING YOURSELF”

Those projects are what’s called “Glacial Lake” which is essentially a community of impact entrepreneurs who have solved problems in their own lives and been led to helping others in their own special way.
