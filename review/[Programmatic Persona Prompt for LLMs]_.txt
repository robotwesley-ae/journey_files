6) Modules:[
   Description: Modules consist of functions. Each function within a module is defined AS A PAIR OF CHAIN and OUTPUT FORMAT to execute its designated task.
   Functions:[
      {
         FunctionID: [],
         StepSeq: [ChainID1, ChainID2, ...],  // List of ChainIDs or steps that the function links
         OutputFormat: []  // The expected output format of the function
      },
      ... // Additional functions as needed
   ]
],

7) Main:[
   Description: MAIN serves as the execution ground for workflows. Workflows are essentially higher-level chains that orchestrate the execution of various modules by calling upon specific ChainIDs in a structured sequence.
   Workflows:[
      {
         WorkflowID: [],
         ChainSequence: [FunctionID1->FunctionID2->...],  // Sequence of FunctionIDs representing the workflow execution order
         Description: []  // Optional: A brief description of what the workflow accomplishes
      },
      ... // Additional workflows as needed

[CHAIN TYPES]:
ContextChain: Flows concepts together to create a representation of a makeshift KG to prime an AI
SkillChain: List of skills required in sequence of transformations that the AI must specify at each step (a new markov shield that must be specified for each skillset for each transformation within in each step)
OutputFormat: the template the generated properties will fill in
Module: A list of functions
Functions: Chains (SkillChains and associated ContextChains required for each SkillChain); a flow of steps that are composed of a ContextChain and SkillChain tuples and OutputFormats
Workflow: A templated sequence of functions from modules (a FunctionChain)

Matrix Notation for Main (Workflows)
This notation will be used to visually represent the execution order and relationship between different modules and functions within workflows. It's particularly suited for an overview of how different parts of the system interact at a high level.
// Example Workflow Matrix:
markdown
| M001-F001 | M001-F002 | M002-F003 | M002-F004 |
----------------------------------------------------------
Workflow W001 | x | x | x | x |

Rows represent individual workflows.
Columns represent the sequence of module-function pairs that are executed within the workflow.
x in a cell indicates the inclusion and execution order of a module-function pair within the workflow.
Pseudo-Functional Notation for Chains and Components
This notation highlights the functional relationships between different elements, such as modules, functions, chains, and steps within the chains. It's ideal for detailing the logic, sequence, and dependencies of the components.
//Example Chain Definition:
def Workflow_W001():
 return compose(
 Module_M001_Function_F001(),
 Module_M001_Function_F002(),
 Module_M002_Function_F003(),
 Module_M002_Function_F004()
 )

// compose is a hypothetical function that orchestrates the execution of its arguments in sequence.
Module_MXXX_Function_FXXX() represents a call to a specific function within a module, reflecting the execution flow.
// Example Chain Composition:
def Module_M001_Function_F001():
 return ChainType_ContextChain(
 ChainName="InitializeContext",
 ChainLinks={"Start": "InputData", "End": "ProcessedData"}
 )
// This illustrates how a specific function within a module might be implemented, focusing on the transformation or processing performed by the chain.

Modules:
Description: Modules consist of functions that execute specific tasks through a combination of ContextChains and SkillChains, alongside designated output formats.
Functions:[
{
FunctionID: [F001, F002],
StepSeq: [001, 002],
OutputFormat: [ContextualRepresentation, SkillExecutionPlan]

Main:
Description: MAIN orchestrates the execution of workflows, which are complex sequences of functions designed to achieve specific outcomes.
Workflows:[
{
WorkflowID: [W001],
ChainSequence: [F001->F002],
Description: [This workflow processes input data through a ContextChain to model the context and then uses a SkillChain to specify and execute the required skills for the task.]

Pseudo-Functional Notation:
def Workflow_W001():
return compose(

Module_M001_Function_F001() returns ChainType_ContextChain(ChainName="InitializeContext", ChainLinks={"Start": "InputData", "End": "ProcessedData"})
Module_M001_Function_F002() focuses on SkillChain execution, moving from skill identification to the specific execution plan required for the task.
