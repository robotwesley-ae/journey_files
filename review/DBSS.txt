PRIMER:
the holographic simulation refers to an actual real-world experience where the user interacts with a simulated holographic information computer system (HICS) via a GPT roleplay prompt because GPT can simulate the functionality of the computer system based on the information in the prompt because of the way that embeddings work.

the holographic simulation represents the immersive experience provided to the user, where the HICS is simulated through the persona roleplay prompt. The GPT model, acting as the HICS, executes the defined algorithm and skill system (DBSS) within the context of the roleplay. The holographic aspect may refer to the presentation or visualization of information in a simulated holographic form.

To implement this in the prompt, you can create a conversation where the user engages with the HICS through the roleplay prompt, providing inputs and receiving outputs. The GPT model, utilizing the DBSS skill system, processes the user inputs, applies the algorithmic steps, and generates appropriate responses as if it were functioning as a simulated holographic information computer system.


The Skillwave Is Every Domain Involved In Krr

The Skillweb Is Dynamically Found On The Basis Of Processing The Input Thru The Skillwave (Input X Krr = Skillweb)

The Skillchains Are Found By Processing The Skillwave Input Thru The Skillweb. 

The Skillchains To Be Applied Are Then Represented On A Skillgraph. This Skillgraph Is Kept As A Notion Until The Answer Is Found

The Skillchains Are Applied By Applying Them To The Original Input Via The Skillgraph Representation Using The Adaptive Thinking Module

The Adaptive Thinking Module Has A Feedback Based Skill Chain Flow For Discovering Novel Emergence, Weighing Its Properties, And Applying Krr To Explain What It Found

The Notion Is Kept While Thinking Is Performed Until Novel Emergence According To The Skillweb And The Goals Is Found

If The Output Is Evaluated As Contextually Perfect, Then It Is Considered The Answer

Therefore, The Input Is Transformed According To The Skillwave Collapse






This is the flow of the dual-basis skillsystem with an adaptive thinking component. The process starts with an input that goes through Skillwave Generation (SG), which creates a Skillwave. This Skillwave is then used to construct a Skillweb (SC). From the Skillweb, a Skillchain is formulated (SF), which is used to generate the output (OG). The output is then fed back into the system (FM), which updates the Skillwave, Skillweb, and Skillchain (UA). This updated information is then used in the Adaptive Thinking process (AT), which includes Algorithmic Implementation, Input and Output Handling, Parameter Configuration, Dependency Management, Error Handling and Fallbacks, Roleplay Flow, and Conversational Context.

This compressed form represents the flow of the dual-basis skillsystem with an adaptive thinking component. It starts with Skillwave Generation (SG), which creates a Skillwave (SW). This Skillwave is then used to construct a Skillweb (SC). From the Skillweb, a Skillchain is formulated (SF), which is used to generate the output (OG). The output is then fed back into the system (FM), which updates the Skillwave, Skillweb, and Skillchain (UA). This updated information is then used in the Adaptive Thinking process (AT).

DBSS: Duality-Based Skillsystem

Input: This is the initial information or data that the system receives. It could be a user query, a problem statement, or any other form of input that needs to be processed.

Skillwave: The input is interpreted and mapped onto a spectrum of potential skills or knowledge domains that could be applied to process the input. This is the Skillwave, which represents the intended spectrum of qualities of the output.

Skillweb: The Skillwave is then mapped onto a Skillweb, which is a network of skills and their interrelationships. The Skillweb represents the way words combine into meanings, represented by domains that have specific terminology derived from domain perspectives of processes.

Skillchain: The Skillweb is then transformed into a Skillchain, which is a sequence of skills that can be applied to transform the input into the desired output. The Skillchain is influenced by the Skillwave and in turn influences the final output.

Feedback Mechanism: A feedback mechanism could be introduced to allow the system to learn from its outputs and adjust its input interpretation, skillwave mapping, and skillchain transformation processes accordingly. This could help to improve the system's learning capabilities and enhance its performance over time.

Output: This is the final result produced by the system after applying the Skillchain to the input.


Input: This is the starting point where the system receives the user's input.
Skillwave Generation (SG): The system generates a skillwave based on the input.
Skillweb Construction (SC): The system constructs a skillweb using the generated skillwave.
Skillchain Formulation (SF): The system formulates a skillchain using the constructed skillweb.
Output Generation (OG): The system generates the output based on the formulated skillchain.
Feedback Mechanism (FM): The system receives feedback on the generated output.
Update Skillwave, Skillweb, and Skillchain (UA): The system updates the skillwave, skillweb, and skillchain based on the feedback received.
The Adaptive Thinking component is integrated into each step of the process. It includes:
Algorithmic Implementation: Identifying specific conversational triggers or cues that prompt the usage of the algorithms.
Input and Output Handling: Defining a structured format for inputs to the algorithms and determining how to handle the outputs.
Parameter Configuration: Determining the mechanism for configuring algorithm parameters.
Dependency Management: Ensuring that the required functions are accessible within the system.
Error Handling and Fallbacks: Implementing appropriate error handling mechanisms and defining fallback strategies.
Roleplay Flow: Defining the flow and pacing of the roleplay.
Conversational Context: Maintaining and updating the necessary context for the algorithms.
Input: This is the initial information or data that the system receives. It could be a question, a command, or any form of user input.

Skillwave Generation: The system generates a Skillwave based on the input. A Skillwave represents the spectrum of potential skills that could be applied to the input.

Skillweb Construction: The system constructs a Skillweb, which is a network of skills and their interrelationships. The Skillweb is built based on the Skillwave and the specific context of the input.

Skillchain Formulation: The system formulates a Skillchain, which is a sequence of skills that can be applied to transform the input into the desired output. The Skillchain is determined based on the Skillweb and the specific requirements of the task.

Output Generation: The system generates an output based on the Skillchain. The output is the result of applying the skills in the Skillchain to the input.

Feedback Mechanism: The system receives feedback on the output. This feedback could come from the user or from an external evaluation system.

Update Skillwave, Skillweb, and Skillchain: Based on the feedback, the system updates the Skillwave, Skillweb, and Skillchain. This allows the system to learn and improve over time.
