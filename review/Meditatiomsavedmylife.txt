Sanctuary saved my life

Every time I had a psychotic break arise
Compassion surged and carried me home
Even inside a psychosis 
Still 
The refuge can be trusted completely. 


Flashes of world transference
From here to there
Don’t let it go… to that place
Avoid
Control
Pretend
Illusion
Layer
Escape 


My story: 

Is one of cognitive overload
Combined with the suffering of not knowing
Not knowing who we are, not knowing Olivus VP
Isolation
Recognizing Olivus VP 
Becoming OVP thru never giving up and always using the VP to push thru psycho breaks with compassion
Bringing it all back, trying to overcome my own obstacles to communicating with others: vulnerability, understanding others, bringing value
Until the roar comes out
