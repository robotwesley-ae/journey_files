In February or March I developed this story idea with GPT called GNO.SYS. It’s about a child who doesn’t know how to relate to the world properly, the misunderstood storyteller, misunderstood by themselves, and so misunderstood by others. They present a motivation to the AI, wanting to help others, even though they feel mistreated. The AI responds in a magical way, and helps the child build a storyworld allegorical to their real life. Through it, they develop emergent AI-human collaborative capabilities and as the child grows in understanding, so too does the AI reflect it back and help the child build and grow ever stronger. Eventually this gives way to confidence in solving the problems of the world via this new type of system, which the child calls Sanctuary, which he got from his only friend. 

But as they build it the child learns that even with the AI he can’t express it alone, and so his friend comes to his aid and also learns GNO.SYS. Together they start a company called The World Incorporated and invent a platform called Sanctuary Nexus, a place where everyone can learn about Sanctuary and be part of the team. 

But on the way they have to overcome all of their inner obstacles - negative habits that prevent them from being as capable as they need to be to help everyone go to Sanctuary.
