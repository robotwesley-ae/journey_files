Remember who you are talking to
Don’t say anything they don’t know/can’t latch on to EXCEPT THE PRODUCT AND ITS USP/HOOK

Copy and funnels are all about SIGNALS OF LOVE

and 
humans will process SIGNALS OF LOVE SUBCONSCIOUSLY 
as you 
SIGN the SIGNALS OF LOVE into their CONSCIOUSNESS  (TRANSMISSION).
This can 
AUTOMATICALLY CONVERT THEM 
by HAVING A FUNNEL THAT DESTROYS OBSTACLES 
according to their 
LEVEL OF PERCEPTION OF THE FANTASY HERO ASCENSION ACCOMPLISHMENT 
DREAM OFFER (Alex hormozi hero of gyms and businesses and five figure jobs).
This happens while they
CALCULATE whether or not they think they could 
use the product to OVERCOME KNOWN PAST OBSTACLES involved in ACCOMPLISHING THE EMERGENT BUILDING CONCATENATIONS OF THE HERO ENGINE SYNTHESIS PATHWAY (so they can get the competitive advantage that helps them as they go into the next stage of THEIR COMPETITION, which is ALWAYS A PERSONAL MATTER WITH INTERPERSONAL CONSEQUENCES, but if the funnel is set up correctly, is encompassed by an Ascension level and its Accomplishment Funnel [course]). 

What about a funnel that sells ENLIGHTENMENT or actually just BODHICHITTA and unlimited personalized commentary — how much is it worth? An actual number. Then probe, then put them in the trigger mindset, then “give them the instruction”. Then give them commentary and help and practices if they didn’t get it. 

“Hey do you wanna become a superhero and save the world? You think I’m joking. Actually, I’m not.” 

Keep forgetting the profound instructions? Try simpler ones like the overall sanctuary heart contemplation: because of what it is, there’s a way this all goes so we can all be safe and happy going to Sanctuary. 

Too lazy to do anything? Unmotivated? How about infinite motivation, inspiration, and dedication? When you truly take HEROIC RESPONSIBILITY for the state of yourself, others, and the world around you, you wont be able to stop doing whatever benefits everyone. 

Infinite focus? Literally everything in life exists because we have enough focus to learn about hazardous shit over time and not die from it. As a consequence, every aspect of our waking lives requires, demands, focus. What would you do with an unlimited amount of focus? Who would you become? 

What about the elixir of immortality? Amrita? We can’t actually guarantee you find the elixir of immortal life, but we know for sure that you will live a healthier, kinder, happier, less stressful, less anxious, less depressed, less depersonalized life, with stronger interpersonal connections and higher impact. If your impact is high enough, you could actually be the Olivus Victory-Promise that discovers the elixir of immortality — or maybe Olivus Victory-Promise IS the elixir and therefore we CAN guarantee immortality in Sanctuary. 

So what if all the videos are designed to not go viral but for individuals and the community is designed to slowly go viral by being secret
