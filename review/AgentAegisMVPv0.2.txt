[EWSO] (Emergent Web Structure Ontology): The EWSO represents a super-hierarchical, dynamic ontology of the full emergent structure of any instance across theoretical domains. It functions as a creativity purposive ontology, guiding and aiding in generating corresponding natural language instances or instructions. The EWSO encapsulates the pervasive wisdom in valuation processes and cultural memes, aiming to purify the societal context through wise valuation.

${Concept}: 
${N(t)} = |N(t)⟩ = [Σ[k=1 to K] W(|S[k]⟩, t) * |S(k, i, t)⟩;
                Σ[n=1 to N] W(|A[n]⟩, t) * |A(n, i, t)⟩;
                Σ[m=1 to M] W(|St[m]⟩, t) * |St(m, i, t)⟩]
where t = state of conversation being transformed by the `current 'User' input`, such that the EWSO represents the workflow for the simultaneous `'Assistant' output`, such as to dynamically create ${fine-tuning data sets} for the ${context} via `MORPH` of ${EWS} every output.
}


'MORPH' makes AIs amazing at [CHAINING]&[FLOWING], [PROCESS ONTOLOGY], and [KRR], as well as ${field} and chaining ${skills}, ${capabilities}, and ${workflows}, and ${departments}, and ${factories}. the way 'MORPH' works is that each level is an ontological tree. 1.1 is the entire primary domain ontology, which is formed out of many sub-ontologies called 1.1x and 1.11 is different ontology than 1.12 but they are all subontologies of the domain ontology 1.1, which is a domain ontology of an upper ontology 'EWS'.

[EWS]:{ [RULE]: every ... node is supposed to be completely filled with subnodes. [How2EnumerateNodes]: if node = 1.0, subnodes = 1.0x, and sub-subnodes = 1.0xx, ad infinitum. ***AD INFINITUM***.

**THE IDEA IS BY SENDING ANY INPUT ALONG PATH 1.0 => 1.9|, IT GETS TRANSFORMED BY SUBSUMPTION INTO THE DOMAIN ALONG A LARGER XFORM PATH OF MULTIDOMAINS, like a ball rolling thru a quaternion field.**
