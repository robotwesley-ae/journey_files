This eliminates the need for users to go through the KYC process multiple times, making it easier for them to access and use the services within the Poly Ecosystem.

Poly Being consists of two sub-modules: PolyDID and PolyWallet. PolyDID is a decentralized identifier (DID) management system that uses DID standards to provide globally unique, cryptographically verifiable identities for users within the Poly Ecosystem. PolyWallet is a non-custodial wallet that gives users sole control of their private keys, which in turn control their assets within the Poly Ecosystem.

The business plan for Poly Being includes a subscription model for policy makers and innovators, as well as in-app purchases for meta-tourists. Policy makers and innovators will be charged a monthly or annual fee to access and use the Poly Being product. Meta-tourists will be able to purchase additional features or services within the Poly Being app, such as additional storage or identity verification services.

In addition to these revenue streams, Poly Being will also generate income from SDK and API fees. Developers and organizations that use the Poly Being SDK and APIs to build their own products and

Intellectual Properties Registry System (IPRS) 
The Intellectual Properties Registry System (IPRS) is a revolutionary new tool for producers of intellectual property. By leveraging the power of blockchain technology and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), we are able to create a system that makes it easier for creators to register, manage, and protect their work. This is a significant improvement over the current system, which can be cumbersome and confusing for many creators.

One of the key advantages of the IPRS is that it allows producers to register their intellectual property within the Poly Ecosystem first, before registering with their local government. This streamlines the process and makes it easier for producers to get their work registered and protected.
The IPRS utilizes the latest in blockchain technology to create a secure and transparent system for registering and managing intellectual property. This technology allows for the creation of unique NFTs for each piece of intellectual property, which can be easily tracked and transferred on the blockchain.

In addition, the IPRS utilizes AI technology to provide creators with easy-to-use tools for managing their intellectual property. This includes features such as automatic classification and tagging of intellectual property, as well as search and transfer tools that make it easy for creators to find and share their work with others.

The IPRS has been developed inline with the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) standards, which has been actively researching the use of blockchain technology for intellectual property management. 

We are looking for partners to test a prototype of the IPRS. This will allow us to gather valuable feedback and further refine the system before its official launch. We are excited to bring this innovative new tool to market, and we look forward to working with our partners to help creators protect and manage their intellectual property in the most effective way possible.

Revenue Model
A potential revenue model for the IPRS platform could involve charging fees for the use of its SDK and API. These fees could be paid in P8, the utility token in the Poly Ecosystem, and could be based on a per-use or subscription basis.

For example, creators who want to register and manage their intellectual property on the IPRS platform could be required to pay a fee in P8 to access the platform's SDK and API. This fee could be based on the number of NFTs they want to create or the amount of data they want to store on the blockchain.

In addition, creators who want to transfer their intellectual property to others could also be required to pay a fee in P8. This fee could be based on the value of the intellectual property being transferred, as well as the level of protection and security provided by the IPRS platform.

Furthermore, the IPRS platform could also generate revenue from partnerships with organizations such as the WIPO, which could be interested in using the platform for their own intellectual property management needs. These partnerships could involve licensing fees for the use of the IPRS platform, as well as potential revenue sharing arrangements.

Overall, by charging fees for the use of its SDK and API, as well as potentially partnering with organizations like the WIPO, the IPRS platform could generate significant revenue in the form of P8 tokens. This revenue could be used to further develop and improve the platform, as well as support the creators who use it to register and manage their intellectual property. Additionally, the IPRS platform could also potentially earn revenue from services such as providing support and consulting to creators on the best ways to protect and manage their intellectual property on the platform. This could involve offering premium services for a higher fee, or providing personalized support for a select group of creators.
In summary, the IPRS platform could generate revenue from a variety of sources, including fees for the use of its SDK and API, partnerships with organizations like the WIPO, and additional services such as support and consulting. By offering a valuable tool for creators to register and manage their intellectual property, the IPRS platform could potentially earn significant revenue in the form of P8 tokens.
