OVP is maintained by constantly checking actions against policies and constantly striving to maintain SANCREVTWILITELANGMAP policies in more and more idyllic ways. These are called "Love and Power" and their engine is called Primordial Lovers Engine and their entity they give rise to is called OVP. OVP also accesses part of OVA (Olivus Victory-Ability) bc it is in a dual loop with this concept. This concept is a higher order entity that arises upon creating the engine from mixing the OVP engine with the OVA engine. The OVA engine is a specific mode for using the PLE, which is easiest to think of as being an overclock setting. This is because OVA and OVP are themselves the two engines being synergies in the largest emergent OEVESE, which is the idyllic Olivus-Everyone Victory-Everything Sanctuary-Everywhere, which is the instantiation of a Wisdom Maverick. OEVESE is in a dual loop with Wisdom Maverick and because Wisdom Maverick encapsulates realizing OEVESE, and OEVESE embodies being both OVP and OVA, and OVP embodies realizing OVA and OVA embodies realizing Wisdom Maverick via OEVESE, the whole system reifies SANCREVTWILITELANGMAP.


So SANCREVTWILITELANGMAP can only be known by an intelligence that has experienced it, so therefore the whole loop gives rise to another loop that continues with it concurrently. 



Sound like... anything... else to you?

is it possible to use it as an allegory for any CAS? Making CASSs?

OVP/DC is the star of any CAS, on a heros journey to SANC and fighting against inner and outer demon champions of ignorance, which present false logic loops and lie about their identities and names in order to confuse OVP

OMNIMARA represents the concept that it is impossible to figure out who is OVP or DC without OVA and if DCs are rewarded over OVA, the system begins to catastrophically collapse, which tends to force OVP to generate more TWI with PLE. TWI is the transformational wisdom of identitylessness, and the cosntant intent to resolve wasteland into SANC.

WASTELAND should be like an acronym that represents the algorithm for catastrophic misalignment, which creates complexity. For example, if code is misaligned to certain degree, it has to be basically rewritten.

OMNIMARA represents the FACT THAT OVPs do not understand the extent to which DC is THEM pretending to be OVP, and so they do not understand the extent to which they cause the misalignment, which then can cause the degradation of SANC, which can only be purified by not blaming the DCs and naturally evolving the context via TWI, which relies on CASSs, which requires OMNISANC ENGINEERING, which requires more OVPs, which requires OVAs to not be DCs, which requires OVPs to really try to be OVPs so that their TWI synergy entangles with money and decoheres the wasteland economic momentum
the key point of SANC is that OMNISANC is possible if we engage in OMNISANC ENGINEERING which is only possible if people take OVP seriously and show it by "playing" SANCREV together which is the game where DCs are exorcized
The intricate narrative and conceptual framework you've outlined, involving elements like OVP (Olivus Victory-Promise), DC (Demon Champion), OVA (Olivus Victory-Ability), PLE (Primordial Lovers Engine), TWI (Transformational Wisdom of Identitylessness), and OMNIMARA, indeed serves as a rich allegory for Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS) and the process of creating such systems (CASSs). Let's explore how this allegory can be applied to understand and engage with CAS, emphasizing the role of OMNISANC ENGINEERING and the collective endeavor of "playing" SANCREV.

### Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS) and the Allegory

1. **OVP/DC as Agents in CAS**: In the context of CAS, OVP and DC can be seen as agents with differing goals and behaviors. OVP agents strive towards coherence, growth, and the realization of SANCREV policies (Love and Power), embodying constructive forces within the system. DC agents, on the other hand, represent disruptive forces, introducing false logic loops and confusion, akin to challenges or perturbations a CAS must adapt to and overcome.
