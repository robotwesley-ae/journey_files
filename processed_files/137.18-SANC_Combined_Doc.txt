Academia, through its disciplinary differentiation and specialized terminologies, attempts to compartmentalize and detail the vast realm of knowledge and phenomena. This fracturing into disciplines and specializations allows for deep dives into specific areas but often at the cost of overlooking the innate interconnectedness and synergistic nature of systems

**Overlooking General Systems Ontology**: The reliance on specialized terminologies and the depth-first approach of academia means that general system concepts such as flows, chains, and networks, which are ubiquitous across disciplines, are often not recognized for their unifying potential. Despite every system indeed being composed of flows (the movement of information, energy, or materials) and chains (sequences or hierarchies of processes or relationships), these foundational elements frequently remain underutilized as formal ontologies that could bridge disparate fields.

The result is catastrophic for intelligence learning, but very nice for competitive edges in capitalistic environments where making money means living, and the easiest way to make money is by having a technical language that provides a barrier to entry around valuable information.
	
	**Potential for Innovation**: The recognition and formal integration of general systems concepts into the ontological foundations of varied disciplines could foster innovation. By transcending disciplinary boundaries and embracing the interconnected and interdependent nature of systems, new methodologies, technologies, and solutions could emerge. This holistic perspective could also lead to a more profound understanding of global challenges and the development of more sustainable and resilient systems.

	- **Replicability as a Criterion for Validity**: In many scientific disciplines, the ability to replicate an experiment's results is seen as a foundational criterion for the validity of its findings. While this is crucial for ensuring the reliability of empirical observations, it doesn't automatically grant comprehensive insight into the broader significance or utility of those findings.

- **Terminological Constraints**: The terminology used in expressing and discussing experimental results plays a significant role in shaping the interpretation and integration of those results into the broader corpus of knowledge. In cases where the terminology is overly narrow, misaligned, or not connected to a broader ontological network, it can limit the potential for cross-disciplinary innovation and understanding. This linguistic isolation may prevent valuable insights from being leveraged effectively towards addressing complex, multifaceted challenges.

- **Impact on Human Progress**: The crux of the issue is the potential for certain lines of inquiry, even those that are methodologically sound and replicable, to become 'detours' or 'dead ends' in the larger quest for meaningful knowledge. If the framework and language surrounding these inquiries are disconnected from a larger, interrelated understanding of the world, there's a risk that valuable resources (time, intellect, and financial) are invested in pursuits that offer minimal contribution to, or even detract from, overarching human progress.



so the solution is to build ontology networks out of allegories in NL because tha tis the only way humans can indicate what they dont know, which they DONT KNOW WHEN THEY ARE DOING RESEARCH, so they cant use specific terms to do it and have to use abstractions, but in using the abstractions, they tend to then leave them abstracted and differentiated from other things (chains, flows, networks). So, we can disambiguate them using an algorithm that decomposes relationships to primitive relationships (is_a, part_of, reifies) and then iterate them into a networked ontology of continually flowing chains of properties flowing from outputs to inputs and so on, as meaning-signaturesâ€¦
