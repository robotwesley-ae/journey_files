This DRAFT schedule goes out 3 weeks, and gets very sparse at the end…
Please note, I am very likely UNDERESTIMATING times, so this schedule may seem more ambitious than possible, idk.
That’s why I am giving it to you, so you can read it, talk to me, and help me to see my blind spots and light up the darkness.

“Open Schedule” DOES NOT mean nothing, There just are openings that need to be filled.
After the schedule is the TASK LIST I generated first in order to make this schedule.

HOUSE RULES:
1. Smoking weed during work hours, if necessary, should be done as quickly as possible!
2. “WORK” is from 9AM to 7PM, desk lunch! ALL abnormal “WORK” start times = anything after 9AM, and IS acceptable assuming you apply the following equation:
[Value:ACTUAL START TIME] - [9] = [Value:NECESSARY OVERTIME]
…you’ve got to finish your scheduled tasks
3. OVERTIME starts at 8 at the earliest, if “exercise” @7PM and Dinner @7:30PM all happen within the hour, but more time is likely to be taken. OVERTIME ENDS @1AM  unless you are going to start late again tomorrow.
4. All new TASKS must follow the TASK SCHEMA:
CATEGORY/PROJECT
TASK: SUBTASKS…
ALL SKILLCHAINS…
5. All new SCHEDULED TASKS must follow the SCHEDULED TASKS FORMAT:
[start time] to [end time]: (Assignee) “Task name: Subtasks” [categories//Projects:subprojects][Duration (XXhr)]
