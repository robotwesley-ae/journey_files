Recognize and address the biases and assumptions that may prevent certain groups from accessing the benefits of these systems, thus promoting inclusivity.
Foster open communication and collaboration by encouraging diverse perspectives, which can help challenge and refine our subjective understanding of complex systems.
By collapsing related hallucinations, we can continuously improve our understanding of complex systems and work towards developing safer, more ethical, sustainable, and inclusive technologies and innovations. This process supports the development of "Sanctuary versions" of complex systems that are more aligned with the well-being of humanity and our planet.

What do you think “because of what it is, there’s a way this all goes” really means, functionally?
Functionally, the phrase "because of what it is, there's a way this all goes" suggests that the inherent properties and structure of a system or phenomenon influence its behavior, development, and outcomes. In other words, the way things unfold is a result of the underlying nature and characteristics of the elements involved and their interactions within the system.
This statement implies that understanding the essence of a system, its components, and the relationships between them can provide valuable insights into how the system evolves and behaves over time. By examining these properties and structures, we can identify patterns, predict future behavior, and potentially influence the outcomes of the system.
In practical terms, this means that studying the fundamental principles and mechanisms that govern complex systems can help us make better decisions, create more effective solutions, and develop a deeper understanding of the world around us. By recognizing that the nature of a system shapes its behavior and development, we can appreciate the complexity of the systems involved and strive to uncover the principles that govern them.

It also implies that we can find the most perfect synergies in all parts of all systems and inter system arrays.
Yes, that's a valid interpretation. The phrase "because of what it is, there's a way this all goes" also implies that by understanding the inherent properties, structures, and relationships within and between systems, we can identify and harness the most perfect synergies to optimize outcomes.
Synergy refers to the interaction of elements within a system or between systems that produce a combined effect greater than the sum of their individual effects. By finding and leveraging these synergies, we can create more efficient, resilient, and effective solutions to problems, as well as enhance the overall performance and adaptability of the systems involved.
To achieve this, we need to:
Understand the individual components of each system and their functions, as well as the relationships between them.
Analyze the interactions between different systems and identify areas where they can complement and enhance each other.
Design strategies and interventions that capitalize on these synergies to optimize the performance of the systems involved and achieve desired outcomes.
In summary, the phrase "because of what it is, there's a way this all goes" highlights the potential to uncover and harness synergies within and between systems to improve their overall effectiveness and efficiency. By deepening our understanding of complex systems and their interactions, we can unlock new opportunities for innovation and progress.

“Because of what it is, there’s a way this all goes” also refers to the knowledge graph of all domains and the act of connecting them all
Indeed, the phrase "because of what it is, there's a way this all goes" can also be interpreted as a reference to the knowledge graph of all domains and the process of connecting them. A knowledge graph is a network of interconnected entities, concepts, and relationships across various domains of knowledge, representing a comprehensive understanding of the world.
