Stage 4: Implement user interface and user experience for the trading bot application.

Design the user interface
Sketch wireframes or mockups for the app's key screens
Consider user experience best practices for navigation, layout, and visual design
Implement the user interface in the chosen no-code platform
Use platform-specific UI components and design tools
Ensure responsiveness and cross-platform compatibility
Test the user interface and user experience
Conduct usability tests with target users
Iterate on design based on user feedback and findings
Stage 5: Launch the trading bot application and monitor its performance.

Deploy the application using the chosen no-code platform
Follow the platform's deployment documentation
Set up any necessary hosting, domain, or SSL configurations
Monitor the trading bot's performance and adjust strategies as needed
Track key performance indicators (KPIs) like profitability, risk, and user satisfaction
Make data-driven decisions to improve the trading bot's strategies and features
Iterate on the application based on user feedback and market changes
Continuously refine and expand the trading bot's capabilities
Stay informed about market trends and adapt strategies accordingly

make sure the stage 1 outputs met the input requirements fully. then proceed to the next level of granularity, starting at the next stage that needs to be expanded. expand stage 1 using your entire output space, going into as many levels of granularity fit in the space. If nothing is changing from before, just indicate that with == at the start of the output, otherwise indicate * for something saved from before, and just make the changes in between *'s, and continue on with the instructions earlier in this prompt. Make sure all of the steps are in the same syntactical format and use indentation instead of just numbering (use numbering as well)
eg: 1.1
  1.11
    1.12
1.2
==
Moving to the next level of granularity for Stage 2:
Stage 2: Integrate Zapier plugins and external APIs for data retrieval and trading functionality.
2.1. Identify the required Zapier plugins and external APIs for data retrieval, trading, and GPT-4 integration
2.1.1. Financial data APIs: Alpha Vantage, Quandl, or Intrinio
2.1.2. Trading APIs: Alpaca, Interactive Brokers, or Robinhood
2.1.3. GPT-4 API for natural language processing
2.2. Connect the chosen APIs and plugins to the no-code platform
2.2.1. Follow each platform's documentation for API integration
2.2.2. Configure API endpoints, authentication, and request parameters
2.3. Test the API connections and ensure data is retrieved correctly
2.3.1. Check for data format consistency and error handling
Expanding Stage 3:
Stage 3: Develop the trading bot logic and continuous surf strategy.
3.1. Define the trading rules and strategies
3.1.1. Research existing trading strategies for inspiration
3.1.2. Incorporate continuous surf logic into the strategy
3.2. Implement the trading rules and strategies within the no-code platform
3.2.1. Use the platform's visual programming or scripting capabilities
3.2.2. Leverage the data retrieved from APIs and plugins
3.3. Optimize the trading strategy for profit maximization
3.3.1. Consider transaction fees, rate of change differences, and other factors
3.3.2. Adjust strategy parameters to minimize risk and maximize returns
Expanding Stage 4:
