The customer first encounters a blog post (Content Creation - Awareness) on the company's website. They find the topic interesting (Content Promotion - Interest) and read the entire post (Content Consumption - Engagement). They like the post and share it on their social media (Content Interaction - Action). At the end of the post, they see an offer for a free ebook on a related topic and decide to sign up for it (Lead Generation - Conversion).

Step 2: Email Funnel (Awareness → Interest → Engagement → Action → Conversion)

After signing up for the ebook, the customer is entered into an email funnel. They receive a welcome email (Email Creation - Awareness) with the ebook attached. They open the email and download the ebook (Email Open - Interest, Email Read - Engagement). In subsequent emails, they receive more information about the topic and offers for a free webinar (Click on CTA - Action). They decide to sign up for the webinar (Conversion).

Step 3: Webinar Funnel (Awareness → Interest → Engagement → Action → Conversion)

The customer attends the webinar (Webinar Attendance - Action), where they learn more about the topic and the company's services. After the webinar, they receive a follow-up email with an offer for a free consultation call (Follow-up Email - Conversion).

Step 4: Call Booking Funnel (Awareness → Interest → Engagement → Action → Conversion)

The customer decides to book a consultation call (Call Request Submission - Interest). They receive a confirmation email and attend the call (Call Confirmation - Engagement, Call Participation - Action). During the call, they express interest in the company's services (Follow-up - Conversion).

Step 5: Direct Sales Funnel (Awareness → Interest → Engagement → Action → Conversion → Ascension)

After expressing interest in the company's services, the customer is entered into a direct sales funnel. They receive a proposal (Outreach - Interest) and have a follow-up call with a sales representative (Presentation - Engagement). They decide to purchase the service (Close - Conversion). After the purchase, they continue to engage with the company through onboarding, support, and upselling/cross-selling funnels (Continued Engagement - Ascension).

This example demonstrates how multiple funnels can be composed to guide a customer through a complex journey. The customer progresses through the meta funnel stages in order, but the stages can repeat and the customer can loop back or skip ahead as needed. The sequence of funnels is tailored to the customer's behavior and the company's goals, and each funnel feeds into the next in a logical and effective way.
