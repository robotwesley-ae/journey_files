Kevin frantically scans the artists-only section for any sign of Zion, his heart racing as he searches through the crowds of people. He knows that this is where his son is likely to be, and he needs to find him before it's too late.
As he turns a corner, he spots a group of people huddled together, smoking and chatting. His eyes lock onto a familiar figure - it's Playboi Carti, surrounded by his entourage.
Kevin knows that this is his best shot at finding Zion, and he begins to push his way through the crowd. Suddenly, he hears a voice behind him.
"Hey, you! You've got some serious moves!"
He turns to see Shenseea, the Jamaican artist he had met earlier, standing behind him with a grin on her face.
"Thanks," Kevin replies, trying to keep his focus on finding his son. "But I really need to find my son. He's missing."
Shenseea's expression turns serious, and she nods in understanding. "I'll keep an eye out for him. What's he look like?"
Kevin quickly describes Zion, his eyes scanning the area for any sign of him. Playboi Carti and his entourage are getting closer, and Kevin knows that he needs to act fast.
"Thanks, Shenseea. I appreciate it," he says, before pushing his way through the crowd towards Playboi Carti.
As he gets closer, he can feel his heart pounding in his chest. This is it - his chance to find Zion and get him out of here. He braces himself for the worst, but as he finally reaches Playboi Carti, he spots Zion standing next to him, looking dazed but unharmed.
With a surge of relief, Kevin scoops Zion up in his arms, ignoring the protests from Playboi Carti and his entourage. He knows that he needs to get his son out of here as quickly as possible, and he begins to make his way towards the exit.
As they exit the artists-only section, Shenseea is waiting for them, a concerned look on her face. "Is everything okay?" she asks.
Kevin nods, still holding Zion close. "Yeah, we're good. Thanks for your help."
With that, he turns and disappears into the sea of festival-goers, determined to get Zion to safety and never let him out of his sight again.

Kevin, still feeling the effects of the drug, struggles to focus as Shenseea continues to flirt with him, complimenting his dance moves from earlier. But his primary concern remains finding his son, and he interrupts her, asking if she knows where Playboi Carti is.
Shenseea smiles knowingly and tells him that she does, leading him through the festival grounds to a super-private bus guarded by Playboi Carti's personal bodyguards.
Kevin's heart races as he approaches the bus, wondering if his son is inside. He thanks Shenseea and prepares to enter, but the bodyguards stop him, demanding to know his business.
Kevin tries to explain his situation, but the bodyguards are skeptical. Just then, a voice calls out from inside the bus. "Let him in."
The bodyguards reluctantly step aside, and Kevin enters the bus, relieved to find his son safe and sound. They embrace, and Kevin thanks Playboi Carti for looking after Zion.
As they exit the bus, Shenseea approaches Kevin, still looking for a dance partner. But Kevin, having learned his lesson, politely declines and instead shares a heartfelt moment with his son as they leave the festival together.

"Hey, are you alright?" she asks, concerned.

"I'm looking for my son," he mumbles, his words slurring together.
Shenseea looks at him sympathetically. "I'm sorry to hear that. But I think I can help you."
Kevin perks up, suddenly more alert. "You can? How?"
