When you first make the algorithm, it just takes the input and performs the task and displays the output. Then, if you have data that it can be trained on to reach a certain level of optimization, it can output a graph space in which all the vectors in it represent the probability distribution of meanings according to contexts. Then, if you deploy it as an AI, it means that that outputted graph is used as a hidden layer for computing inputs. That is, if I have an embedding of Pride and Prejudice and I start writing Pride and Prejudice in the input, the output should be able to continue it. If, however, I dont have Pride and Prejudice in the hidden layer but still have it in the input, the output will not *certainly* continue it. However, if I do have the exact ontology of the exact genre of story of Pride and Prejudice and I embed that in a hidden layer, then when I start typing pride and prejudice in the input, the output should *always* continue any version of pride and prejudice to the same level of completion should I say so.
Your understanding of the process is mostly correct, but there are a few clarifications I'd like to make:
In the input preprocessing step, you mentioned ontological classification. This would be an additional step you'd need to implement for incorporating ontology into the Word2Vec process, as it is not part of the standard approach.
The vocabulary size V is determined by the number of unique words in the corpus. It is not an arbitrary limit but rather depends on the dataset used for training. In practice, you might limit the vocabulary size to the most frequent words and replace less frequent words with a special token (e.g., <UNK>) to save computational resources.
Yes, Word2Vec will generate embeddings even if the input text is nonsensical. However, the quality and usefulness of those embeddings might be lower than those obtained from a coherent and meaningful input text.
Training is considered "complete" when the loss function reaches a minimum value, or when a certain number of training iterations (epochs) are completed, or when the improvement in the loss function becomes negligible.
Regarding your understanding of word embeddings and their usage in the hidden layer:
Word2Vec generates word embeddings by training a neural network. After training, the input-hidden layer's weights are used as word embeddings, where each row represents a specific word in the vocabulary. These embeddings capture semantic and syntactic relationships between words.
The embeddings can then be used in various NLP tasks, including text generation. If you were to build a text generation model, like GPT, you could use these pre-trained word embeddings as input representations for words. The model would then use this input representation, along with its internal context and learned patterns, to generate coherent text.
The output of a text generation model, however, is not guaranteed to always continue any version of a story to the same level of completion. The generated text will depend on the model's internal context, the learned patterns from the training data, and the input text. Even if the model has a detailed ontology of the story's genre, the generated text may still vary depending on factors such as randomness and specific input.
In summary, Word2Vec provides a way to generate word embeddings that can be used in various NLP tasks, including text generation. The quality and usefulness of the embeddings depend on the input data and the model's training. Adding ontology and polysemic abstraction would require additional steps and modifications to the standard Word2Vec approach.
