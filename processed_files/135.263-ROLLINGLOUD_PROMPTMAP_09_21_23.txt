Rewrite the following in FDX, but insert dialogue and action of Linda trying to participate in the conversation and Chad trying to keep her out of it: EXT. FESTIVAL GROUNDS - BOOZE TENT - NIGHT Kevin, Chad, and Linda sit at a small table in the bustling booze tent, seeking a moment of respite, trying to blend in. CHAD That was intense. LINDA We just caused a power outage. CHAD That was just like the time we caused a power outage during the basketball game and we doubled team the girl in the bear mascot? KEVIN That never, ever happened. I never did anything close to that. LINDA I can wear a bear mascot. CHAD You’re not in this memory, Linda, don’t try and insert yourself... Two intoxicated girls, BRITTANY and TIFFANY, lock eyes with Kevin and approach. CHAD (nudging Kevin, teasing) Looks like you've got some fans. BRITTANY (giggling) I recognize you! You were dancing with the little person during Shenseea's performance, right? The girls are fixated on Kevin. Kevin senses they're being watched. His unease grows, but he tries to remain composed. TIFFANY You were awesome up there! BRITTANY Mind if we join you? KEVIN Actually, I don’t-- CHAD Um, sure. Chad pulls a free chair over and pushes Linda off her chair and offers it to the girls to sit. LINDA Hey! CHAD You don’t deserve to sit. Linda scoffs and drags over another chair. BRITTANY I’m Brittany. TIFFANY I’m Tiffany. The girls both wearing "artists only" bracelets. Kevin's curiosity is piqued. CHAD (enjoying the attention) I’m Chad. And this is my best friend, G.D. KEVIN It’s Kevin. LINDA I’m Linda. The girls pay no attention to Linda, as Chad tries to box her out of the conversation. CHAD (whispers to the girls) Stands for Girthy dick! BRITTANY Oh, really? KEVIN No. Not really. Chad nods and whispers “yes, really.” BRITTANY (flirting) You were so hot on stage. I bet you can show us some moves. CHAD (smiling) He's got some killer dance skills, that's for sure. TIFFANY (smirking) You're a DILF, you know? CHAD It means "Dad I'd Like to F..." KEVIN (embarrassed) Um, thanks? I appreciate the compliment. Kevin feels torn between the attention and his concern for Zion. His gaze shifts to his wedding ring. TIFFANY (excited) Do you have Snapchat? Let's add each other! KEVIN I don't really use Snapchat. BRITTANY (giggling) Well, you do now! Let's sign you up. The girls take Kevin's phone and guide him through the sign-up process, adding themselves as his friends. Kevin's conflicting emotions resurface as he questions his actions. LINDA (disinterested) Ugh, I'll never understand Snapchat. As the girls send silly photos to Kevin, he tries to relax but can't shake the weight of his wedding ring and his mission to find Zion. Tension builds between Chad and Linda, their animosity growing more apparent with each sarcastic remark. Finally, unable to ignore his conscience, Kevin blurts out. KEVIN I'm married, you know. TIFFANY (laughing) I know, silly. That's why I gave you Snapchat!

EXT. FESTIVAL GROUNDS - BOOZE TENT - NIGHT
Kevin, Chad, and Linda sit at a small table in the bustling booze tent, seeking a moment of respite, trying to blend in.
CHAD That was intense.
LINDA (nods) We just caused a power outage.
CHAD Remember that time we caused a power outage during the basketball game? We doubled team the girl in the bear mascot.
KEVIN (confused) That never happened, Chad. Don't make things up.
LINDA (trying to be included) I could wear a bear mascot too.
CHAD (sighs) Linda, you're not part of this memory. Let's focus.
Two intoxicated girls, BRITTANY and TIFFANY, lock eyes with Kevin and approach.
CHAD (nudging Kevin) Looks like you've got some fans.
BRITTANY (giggling) I recognize you! You were dancing with the little person during Shenseea's performance, right?
The girls seem fixated on Kevin. He starts feeling watched and uneasy.
TIFFANY You were awesome up there!
BRITTANY Mind if we join you?
KEVIN (about to decline) Actually, I don't--
CHAD (smiling) Um, sure.
Chad pulls a free chair over and subtly pushes Linda off her chair, offering it to the girls.
LINDA (annoyed) Hey!
CHAD (low voice) You don't need to sit.
Linda rolls her eyes and grabs another chair for herself.
