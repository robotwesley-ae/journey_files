
Track key performance indicators (KPIs) like profitability, risk, and user satisfaction
Make data-driven decisions to improve the trading bot's strategies and features
Iterate on the application based on user feedback and market changes
Continuously refine and expand the trading bot's capabilities
Stay informed about market trends and adapt strategies accordingly


make sure the stage 1 output from before met the input requirements fully. then proceed to the next level of granularity, starting at stage 1. expand stage 1 using your entire output space, going into as many levels of granularity fit in the space.
Stage 1: Choose a no-code platform for building the trading bot application.
Research and compare no-code platforms (Bubble, Adalo, Glide)
1.1. Identify the features and limitations of each platform
1.2. Look for user reviews and case studies
1.3. Consider pricing and subscription plans
Evaluate their ease of use, compatibility with Zapier, and support for API integration
2.1. Check if they provide native support for Zapier or require additional setup
2.2. Investigate the types of APIs each platform can handle (REST, GraphQL, etc.)
2.3. Assess the platform's learning curve and available resources
Select the platform that best suits your requirements and desired features
3.1. Desired features may include user authentication, dashboard, real-time data visualization, and reporting
3.2. Requirements may include performance, scalability, and responsiveness of the platform
3.3. Ensure the platform can accommodate trading bot logic and continuous surf strategy
Get familiar with the chosen platform's development environment
4.1. Follow tutorials and documentation to learn the platform's interface and features
4.2. Create a prototype or test project to practice using the platform's tools and components
Plan the application's structure and components
5.1. Outline the application's layout, including main screens and navigation
5.2. Identify the components needed for implementing trading bot logic and continuous surf strategy
5.3. Determine the necessary data storage and retrieval mechanisms
At this point, I have used the available space to expand on Stage 1. To maintain coherence and readability, I cannot fit further levels of granularity within this response. However, I can provide more granularity for the other stages or further expand on specific aspects of Stage 1 in separate responses if needed.

Stage 1: Choose a no-code platform for building the trading bot application.
Research and compare no-code platforms (Bubble, Adalo, Glide)
1.1. Identify the features and limitations of each platform
1.1.1. List the unique features of each platform
1.1.2. Note any limitations that may impact the trading bot development
1.2. Look for user reviews and case studies
1.2.1. Search for relevant reviews on forums and review websites
1.2.2. Analyze case studies to understand how others have used the platforms
1.3. Consider pricing and subscription plans
1.3.1. Compare the costs of each platform
1.3.2. Determine which plan best suits your budget and needs
Evaluate their ease of use, compatibility with Zapier, and support for API integration
2.1. Check if they provide native support for Zapier or require additional setup
2.1.1. Explore each platform's integration options
2.1.2. Assess the complexity of connecting with Zapier
2.2. Investigate the types of APIs each platform can handle (REST, GraphQL, etc.)
2.2.1. Check the platforms' documentation for API support details
2.2.2. Ensure the platform can handle the APIs of financial data sources
2.3. Assess the platform's learning curve and available resources
2.3.1. Estimate the time needed to become proficient with the platform
2.3.2. Evaluate the quality and depth of tutorials and documentation
Select the platform that best suits your requirements and desired features
