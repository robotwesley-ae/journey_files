The Sanctuaries and Wastelands of our own mind, which we aggregate there, create real world effects and are all interconnected. My interconnectedness with the "being cool" sanctuary devolved into a wasteland. In the "being cool" wasteland, i realized the existence of sanctuaries and wastelands, and how they change from being one to another, but there is a continual fractal growing towards Sanctuary and away from Wastelands. All wastelands perpetuated by me can pollute others. All Sanctuaries perpetuated by me can purify others. It also means I can give this monster to other people, or I can fight it before they encounter it, and through doing so, at the very least, I will become an example for anyone who encounters it.

It is equally scientific to say they died from cigarette monster attack. The only barrier is whether or not we actually formally call cigarette induced lung cancer "the cigarette monster". 

It is **not relevant**. The cigarette monster **exists** by way of being a mapped allegory, and not just a metaphor.

Your point underscores an important aspect of how we communicate and conceptualize complex scientific realities through allegory and metaphor. Allegories serve as powerful tools to encapsulate and convey intricate ideas, relationships, and causal mechanisms in a way that's accessible and resonant with broader audiences. In the context of discussing the harmful effects of smoking, referring to lung cancer caused by smoking as an attack by the "cigarette monster" is a vivid allegorical representation that conveys the essence of the causal relationship between smoking and lung cancer.
Allegory vs. Metaphor in Scientific Communication
Allegory: An allegory is an extended metaphor, a narrative that acts as a symbolic representation of a deeper meaning or truth. When we say someone died from an "attack by the cigarette monster," we use an allegory to encapsulate the entire chain of causationâ€”starting from the act of smoking, through the biological mechanisms that lead to cancer, to the tragic outcome. This narrative simplifies complex medical and scientific information into a story that highlights cause and effect in a way that is immediately understandable.
Metaphor: While a metaphor is a direct comparison between two unrelated things, an allegory uses this comparison over a longer narrative or conceptual framework. The "cigarette monster" is not just a metaphor for the dangers of smoking; it's an allegorical narrative that spans the entire journey of how smoking can lead to disease and death.
Scientific Validity and Conceptual Tools
The scientific validity of the relationship between smoking and lung cancer is well-established and not dependent on the terminology used to describe it. The choice to describe this relationship through the allegory of the "cigarette monster" doesn't change the underlying scientific facts. However, it does play a crucial role in how these facts are understood, internalized, and acted upon by the public.
The Role of Allegory in Public Health
The use of allegory can be particularly effective in public health campaigns, where the goal is not only to inform but also to motivate behavior change. Complex scientific data and statistics, while precise, may not always resonate on a personal level with individuals. Allegories like the "cigarette monster" can bridge this gap, providing a clear and compelling narrative that encourages individuals to avoid risky behaviors.
Conclusion
In summary, the existence of the "cigarette monster" as a mapped allegory for the dangers of smoking and its role in causing lung cancer is a testament to the power of narrative in science communication. While the terminology might not be used formally in scientific discourse, the concept it represents is deeply rooted in scientific evidence. Allegories like this play a crucial role in translating scientific knowledge into forms that are meaningful and actionable for the general public, underscoring the importance of narrative and metaphor in our understanding of and response to health risks.
