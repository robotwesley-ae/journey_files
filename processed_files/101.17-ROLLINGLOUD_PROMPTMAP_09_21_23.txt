JEREMY'S WIFE (Sighs) We need to talk. JEREMY (Tense) About what? JEREMY'S WIFE (Sighs again) Our marriage. It's not working. JEREMY (Defensive) What are you talking about? We're fine. JEREMY'S WIFE (Shakes her head) No, we're not. We've been drifting apart for a while now, and it's not fair to either of us to pretend like everything's okay. JEREMY (Stunned) I had no idea you felt this way. JEREMY'S WIFE (Sadly) I didn't want to believe it either, but it's time we faced the truth. JEREMY (Nods) Okay. What do we do now? JEREMY'S WIFE (Sighs again) I think we need to take some time apart. See if we can figure out what we want and if we can make this work. JEREMY (Nods again) Alright. I'll sleep on the couch tonight. JEREMY'S WIFE (Smiling faintly) Thank you.
And so the story begins, with Jeremy and Zion heading to Rolling Loud and Jeremy struggling to balance his protectiveness with his son's desire for independence, all while dealing with the fallout from his failing marriage.

now rewrite that scene with the wife, let's call her Samantha. Let's have the scene be about whether or not they could let him go to Rolling Loud, but the subtext is that they are starting a trial seperation because neither of them are happy

INT. JEREMY’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Jeremy sits on the couch, staring blankly at the TV. The sound of Samantha (45) rummaging through a closet can be heard from the other room.
SAMANTHA (O.S.) Jeremy, do you know where I put the photo album?
Jeremy shakes his head, still fixated on the TV.
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) (O.S.) Jeremy, did you hear me?
JEREMY (absentmindedly) Huh? What?
SAMANTHA enters the room, holding a photo album in her hand. She sets it down on the coffee table and sits down next to Jeremy.
SAMANTHA I’ve been thinking about what Zion said earlier. About Rolling Loud.
JEREMY (sighing) I don’t know, Sam. I just don’t think it’s a good idea for him to go to something like that.
SAMANTHA (skeptical) Or is it that you don’t want to go?
JEREMY (defensive) What are you talking about? Of course I don’t want to go. It’s a bunch of teenagers listening to music with explicit lyrics and doing drugs.
SAMANTHA (sighing) I know it’s not ideal, but maybe we need to start giving him some independence. He’s growing up.
JEREMY (concerned) But do you really think it’s safe? What if something happens to him?
SAMANTHA (softening) We can set some ground rules. Check in with him every hour. Make sure he’s not getting into anything he shouldn’t.
JEREMY (nodding reluctantly) Okay, I guess we could try.
SAMANTHA (awkwardly) Speaking of trying...Jeremy, I think we should try a separation. At least for a little while.
Jeremy is taken aback, his eyes widen in shock.
JEREMY (stammering) What? Why?
SAMANTHA (sadly) We both know this isn’t working. We’re not happy.
JEREMY (defeated) I know. I just don’t know what to do.
SAMANTHA (softening) We can start with this. Giving Zion a little independence. Maybe it’ll help us find some too.
Jeremy nods silently, looking down at his hands. The weight of the conversation and his struggles with Zion's homework weighing heavily on his mind.

okay, good -- but the separation shouldn't be news. This should be something they've discussed over the past week. also, i don't think Samantha is pro letting Zion go to rolling loud either. it's not something a responsible parent should allow for a 13 year old

Okay, here's a revised version based on your feedback:
Opening Image: So we open on Jeremy (47), the protective dad, trying to help his son, Zion (13), with his math homework. Jeremy's sweating bullets as he tries to solve algebraic equations and word problems, but Zion's not making things any easier. The kid's glued to his phone, scrolling through the Rolling Loud festival lineup, clearly not interested in what his old man's trying to teach him. "When’s Mommy coming home?” “I don’t know. Can we focus here? It’s late. I’m tired.” We establish that there’s clearly something going on with Jeremy and his wife, Samantha (43), that he doesn’t want to discuss.
Samantha enters the room, carrying a stack of laundry, looking stressed and preoccupied.
