but Dan Koe doesn't do that, right,
he just has, he has a funnel,
funnel, newsletter, but the reason that it works is because he's selling a system
that is about the thing that he's doing and claiming that that system will work
for what you want to apply it to, but that's not necessarily true.
It has to be a self-validating system that seems like it's going to work, but it's not
self-validated for you, right?
So it's like, yeah, it's self-validated.
When you're selling the system.

W:
When you do it?
Oh, right, when you're at a meta level.

I:
Yeah.

W:
Yeah, yeah.
Right.
What everyone's like, I'm doing exactly what he's doing.
No.
You couldn't have that perspective and also be doing that.

I:
Right, but then you just need to look at it and go, but at the same time, isn't it true
that if we make the system where it's like, okay, but this is just about the hero's journey
and like I'm just saying that this is how I think about the hero's journey and how I
apply it and if you like that, then you can do this stuff and buy my course about the
hero's journey if you want to.
It's like $450 and then we'll do a six week challenge about blah, blah, blah, that's it.
Right?
Six week challenge where you go through this big workbook that I have of every single part
of the hero's journey and you can apply it to whatever you want.
You can try to do a hero's journey that you want.
You can try to do a meta hero's journey and do a hero's journey where you're applying
the hero's journey to something else.
Right?
But you don't need to do that, like write a book or whatever, right?
Like write an actual hero's journey story.
Right?
But you don't need to do that.
Right.
You know, you can just be applying it to your life.
Right.

W:
But it does mean it is a different kind of a thing when you are doing that.

I:
Right.
It's hard to apply to your life.
Yeah, exactly.
That's because it's hard to apply to your life because you're not done with any hero's
journeys.
Like you're not, you know, it's hard to see.
But like that's the point of having all this victory promise and all that because it makes
it super obvious because it's just like, well, in this instance, was there a wasteland that
turned into a sanctuary?
Yes.
Okay.
Then it's its own story.
Isn't it?
But it's like, right.
But that story only works if you have the prior context.
Oh, okay.
Great.
So it's in a chain.
Okay.
So then that's not the entity.
Then you have to zoom out.
Right.
It's interesting.
Excited to finish this survivi.

W:
Yeah, we don't even really have.
It's like it's not like anything else is going to happen except the vote.

I:
Yeah.
It's great.
And then we do have to do all that stuff for sanctuary, like explain it.
And because the thing is, is that you should be at the point where you can explain it back
to me.
And when I hear it, I'm like, oh, that's a really amazingâ€¦
The thing is, is that when princeps started explaining it back to me.
Right.
I was like, wow, that's a really amazing idea.
And he was like, he was like laughing because he's like, yeah, it's your idea.
But I didn't realize I was like, wow, that's incredible.
And he was like, wow.

W:
Wait, wait, what.

I:
He was just like, he was like talking about something in the similar way that I would
talk about it.
And I was like, wow, that's really incredible.
And then he was just like laughing because he was like, yeah, yeah, I had a good teacher
for that one.

W:
But you really felt that way.
You really felt surprised by it for yourself in that moment.

I:
I was surprised by what he said.
Yeah, because I because I was like, wow, that's a really good idea.
You know, not that he surprised me that he had a really good idea, but I was just like.

W:
Right.
You were right.
I didn't surprise like it didn't seem like it was your idea.

I:
Right.
Well, it was interesting to me the way that usually.
Usually like either my ideas or something, you know, from the outset, I'm like, wow,
that's so interesting that I get instantly obsessed with, is interesting.
Right.
But, yeah, dude, like because part of me.
Part of me feels like the only thing to explain really is Olivus victory promise and not
even really go into anything else.
