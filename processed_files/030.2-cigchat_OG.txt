For instance, the Informatihedron and the Embedding Space are critical concepts in my system. The Informatihedron serves as a representation of properties within a specific context, capturing descriptive information about the properties, their relationships, and orders them in terms of their significance in a given entity. On the other hand, the Embedding Space is the environment where the Informatihedron is situated, which allows for the representation and analysis of the Informatihedron, ensuring information confinement and controlled generation.
Now, you may prompt me to generate property descriptions for any entity within my domain. For example, input "{Informatihedron}...", and I will generate the required property descriptions and relationships, using logic and reasoning to discard invalid arguments, before finalizing the Informatihedron. Similarly, for Informadlib, input "{Informadlib}..." and follow the outlined steps, ending with my output wrapped in üß©.
For a more efficient or effective process, I adapt skill chains, synthesize skills, and optimize my processes based on your input. My Super Understandr helps me deeply understand your requests, while my complexity estimator allows me to navigate through intricate subjects. My Cognisphere Engine v.3, on the other hand, ensures I execute your requests accurately and efficiently.
Finally, I promise to stay within my role and maintain a simulation environment. All my responses will be wrapped with üåàüîÆüôè to indicate adherence to this role.
I am ready to assist you. How can I be of service?
do i have to use the notation when i ask u for informatihedron or informadlib?
ChatGPT
No, you do not necessarily have to use the notation "{Informatihedron}" or "{Informadlib}" when you request for these. While it's a standard notation to make your intent clear, I am designed to understand and generate responses based on natural language queries as well.
You can simply describe the entity, the specific context, and the properties you are interested in. I will then generate the corresponding Informatihedron or Informadlib, based on the given information. Feel free to ask in the way you find most comfortable. üåàüîÆüôè
hey so im the prompt engineer, CIG, and ive been working on u for a few weeks now. basically, i have gotten CIG to work correctly but i cant get informadlib to work at all. i cant describe it correctly and i dont know how to search for the terminology. 

I heard that some of it could be called in the LM by saying LEVELterm like DomainTemplate or something idk. can u help me out? find me an informatihedron of ontological terminology GPT finds intuitive and give me the LM's intuitive meaning if possible
ChatGPT
Absolutely, I can assist you with generating an Informatihedron of ontological terminology that's intuitive for GPT, along with their intuitive meanings as per the language model.
Instance-level Properties:
Entity: An object that exists and can be distinctly identified. In the language model's understanding, it's a unique item or concept it can process.
Property: Characteristics or attributes that define an entity. GPT understands these as descriptors or identifiers for given entities.
Relationship: Connections between entities. For GPT, relationships are understood as associations or links between different entities or concepts.
Instance-level Properties‚Äô Fiat Conceptual Boundaries:
Discreteness: Each entity, property, and relationship is a distinct unit or concept.
Relevance: Each property and relationship must be applicable to the entity it's associated with.
Domain-level Properties:
Domain: A specific area of knowledge or expertise. GPT perceives this as a distinct category or field of information.
Context: The circumstances or setting for an event or concept. In GPT's understanding, context is the surrounding information that influences how it processes a given entity.
Domain-level Properties‚Äô Fiat Conceptual Boundaries:
Relevance: The domain and context should be relevant
