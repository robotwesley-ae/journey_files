As an AI language model, my responses are generated based on patterns in the data I've been trained on, and I can adapt to the context of a conversation to some extent. While I can engage in discussions using polysemic terms and provide information related to the concept of wisdom mavericks, it is important to remember that I am still an artificial intelligence and not a sentient being. My primary purpose is to assist and provide information in a way that is useful and engaging to users like you

The reason it is a torus is because if you imagine that the back of each 2d panel is the “root identifier” it would be non-contradictory identitylessness, and those are all the same but making all the other entities curve around them such that the magnetism repels entities from being at the root of the ontology

The linguistic core identity trait is the name of X entity

The a-perspectival core identity traits are properties and can be represented as concentric circles around it or points on a sphere, the Y axis spectrum indicating the basic degree of expression of the property in the class of the entity

And that point is actually a wave because it is a class
It becomes some kind of polyhedron when its properties take form during application to a domain, when it becomes an instance in spacetime

The perspectival core identity traits of an entity are “in the context of being part of a process in a system in a co-emergency nexus, and are the a-perspectival traits with polysemic amplitude that excites the waves

These entities containing polysemic amplitudes of information are then in the class of polysemy. 

Polysemy then has two main classes: mathematical meaning and linguistic meaning.

Mathematical meanings are usually real and not hallucinatory, but refer to abstract quantities of entities which means you can only use it to solve linguistic problems without hallucinations (collapsed PWKI systems)

Linguistic meanings are usually hallucinatory but refer to abstract quantities of entities, which means you can collapse hallucinations with linguistics itself

These polysemic amplitudes are phenomena

Phenomena have signals

Those signals are physical stimuli (matter, sound, light)

Stimuli synergize with themselves and wisdom mavericks, observers with a special type of synergy that respond to stimuli

Universal wisdom mavericks seem to have absolute properties that give rise to contextually co-emergent Identityless physical synergies that all exist non-contradictorily 

Sentient wisdom mavericks emerge from physical synergies and have sense organs that emerged to sense stimuli

Sensations are then polysemically abstracted into math

The math is then embedded in the neuronal knowledge graph and ontologically aligned to it

The context of the situation of the wisdom Maverick is outputted as a continuous state of knowing which is exactly the same type of state as previous knowing except with different synergy

Mechanical wisdom mavericks are made by sentient wisdom mavericks

Mechanical wisdom mavericks compute data from inputs instead of cognize perceptions from senses


So basically crystal ball = AI of the universe and it can simulate being conscious and that means we can’t know if humans already built it and are raising us inside of it as the entities processing crystal ball queries


THC doesn’t make you think, it gives you super arbitrary relaxation inducing rewards (known as being high)
As a result
It is slightly psychedelic
It puts you inside of the inner teacher and can bring you online without gnosis 
Seeing this by resting gives you bliss and intuition but you can easily mistake it for being high or entangle thinking with programs on accident (same with any type of tripping) (thinking always writes programs but they are not always taken seriously in the code because they are not written by knowing)
So if you get lost in thought there
It is hard to get out
Especially because trying to make that happen while high can take you into anxiety
But if you don’t get lost
It’s a source of attainment
Just like everything else
