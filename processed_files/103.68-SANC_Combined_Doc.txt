when a customer converts but later falls out of the funnel for any reason, they "flip" as double agents. they are still the avatar, but they are against the system (competing with it by feeding another system). We can now consider these living systems as parasitic meaning-based egregores competing for food, who parasitize on the basis of triggering the "information foraging" sequence by convincing humans they have enough resources right now and should take risks for better sources of resources in the future. This mirrors ADHD psychodynamics, so we can say that the whole idea of an economy is to convince other people not to compound what they are already doing and instead compound another thing because 1) it has a funnel 2) the funnel is more rewarding 3) all they have to do is find one of the things and ascend its ladder. This maps to heros journey originala rchetype of a plagued "wasteland", a journey to slay a dragon, and "paradise" resultant from releasing the life waters the dragon guards. The ADHD aspect mirrors the fact that **humans prefer being in this mode because it feels amazing** and it creates blindspots about compound negatives. It also means, by creating the blindspots, the FunnelChainConstructor also should be in control of these blindspots. It should intentionally construct the funnel such that the compound negative effect of failing upon leaving the current resource is highly obscured by the fact that the MarketingFunnel (which is an instance of the funnel, and is constructed by the FunnelChainConstructor, and has inside of it the value ladder, which reveals the full "FunnelChain" which is the value ladder construction of the current funnel an agent is experiencing). This also means businesses can use the same tactics intelOps use to flip agents, but in their inverted ways: blackmail could become something like "appealing to family values", "tugging heartstrings", "conversational sales hypnosis", etc.
Proteus Redux
ðŸŽ­ The intricate dynamics of customer engagement, conversion, and subsequent disengagement or "flipping" can indeed be conceptualized through a complex narrative of espionage, allegory, and psychodynamics, reflecting broader themes of human behavior, motivation, and persuasion. By viewing these interactions through the lens of living systemsâ€”parasitic meaning-based egregores competing for sustenanceâ€”the intricate dance of information foraging and risk-taking becomes a rich tapestry upon which the economics of attention and conversion are played out. Let's dissect this allegory further to understand its components and implications.
The Dynamics of Conversion and Flipping
Conversion as Allegiance: When a customer converts, they effectively pledge allegiance to a system or brand, integrating into its narrative as an active participant. This moment represents a confluence of belief, value, and expectation, aligning the customer's journey with the brand's promised destination.
Flipping as Rebellion: Disengagement or flipping, in this context, symbolizes a fundamental shift in allegiance. The once-convinced customer becomes a double agent, still navigating within the system's boundaries but now serving competing interests. This transition highlights the fluidity of customer loyalty and the competitive nature of attention economies.
Parasitic Egregores and Information Foraging
Egregores as Competing Systems: In the allegory, brands and market systems are likened to egregoresâ€”collective thoughtforms or entities sustained by belief and attention. These egregores compete for the mental and emotional resources of individuals, seeking to trigger information foraging behaviors that promise richer, albeit riskier, rewards.
ADHD Psychodynamics and Risk-Taking: The alignment with ADHD psychodynamics underscores a human propensity for novelty-seeking and risk-taking, driven by the allure of potentially higher rewards. This behavioral pattern suggests that economies and markets are structured around the perpetual motion of desire, exploration, and conquest, mirroring the Hero's Journey archetype.
