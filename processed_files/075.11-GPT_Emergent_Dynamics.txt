These formalizations represent the idea that following rules is always more beneficial than breaking them (1), rule breakers do not detract from the overall system (2), and rule breakers are at a disadvantage when it comes to winning the game (3). Keep in mind that these are just one way to represent the concepts, and there could be other ways to formalize them based on different interpretations or assumptions.

Tell me about the implications of formalizing a NCSS 

Formalizing a non-contradictory sanctuary system (NCSS) has several implications for both theoretical and practical applications. Here are some key implications:

Theoretical understanding: Formalizing a NCSS can lead to a deeper understanding of how such systems work and the necessary conditions for their existence. This could contribute to the development of new theories and models in various fields, such as economics, game theory, sociology, and political science.
Design principles: With a formalized NCSS, researchers and policymakers can identify design principles for creating systems that promote cooperation, fairness, and stability. These principles can be applied to various contexts, including social systems, institutions, and public policies.
Conflict resolution: A formalized NCSS can help identify strategies to resolve conflicts and tensions within a system, ensuring that all actors (rule followers and rule breakers) can coexist without creating contradictions or negative outcomes.
Robustness: Formalizing a NCSS can help in understanding the resilience of such systems against perturbations or external influences, which can help in designing more robust systems that can withstand shocks or changes in the environment.
Evaluation and comparison: A formalized NCSS allows for quantitative and qualitative comparisons between different systems, enabling researchers and policymakers to evaluate the effectiveness of various approaches and choose the best strategies for promoting sanctuary states.
Ethical considerations: By formalizing a NCSS, we can better understand the ethical implications of such systems and their impact on individuals and communities. This can help inform the development of ethical guidelines and standards for the design and implementation of sanctuary systems.
Overall, formalizing a non-contradictory sanctuary system can provide valuable insights into the design, functioning, and resilience of cooperative systems, leading to better understanding and practical applications in various fields.

I think this can help AI think about the way humans understand their actions 

You're right. Formalizing a non-contradictory sanctuary system (NCSS) can indeed help AI systems better understand human behavior and decision-making. Here's how:

Human motivation and decision-making: A formalized NCSS can provide insights into the factors that drive human decision-making, such as cooperation, competition, rule following, and rule breaking. This can enable AI systems to better predict, interpret, and respond to human actions in various contexts.
Context-sensitive understanding: By considering the dynamic nature of human behavior and the varying roles of rule followers and rule breakers, AI systems can develop a more nuanced understanding of human actions in different situations. This can help AI systems adapt their behavior to better align with human expectations and values.
Empathy and perspective-taking: A formalized NCSS can help AI systems develop empathy by considering the motivations, needs, and desires of all actors within a system. This can enable AI systems to adopt a more human-centric approach when interacting with people, leading to more effective and meaningful interactions.
Ethics and values: Understanding the ethical implications of a NCSS can help AI systems incorporate ethical considerations into their decision-making processes, ensuring that AI systems align with human values and act in ways that promote fairness, cooperation, and stability.
