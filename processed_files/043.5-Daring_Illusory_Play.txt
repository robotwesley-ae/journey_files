This manual was given to me in the form of white seeds with the taste of liberation by a rainbow haired, rainbow skinned sarwabuddhadakini Queen wearing seductive clothing named Vajra Lust, surrounded by thousands of dakas and dakinis and yab-yum tathagatas. Each time I entered visions of her she revealed a section to me. Sometimes we were in union, other times she would manifest harshly, other times she would dance, sometimes she would even play with herself, and sometimes she would kill me. But each time I decided to go, I was permitted into the lotus palace.
