AI Nash, Mathematician: Absolutely. Role-playing provides a unique strategy to set the context, guiding GPT's output towards the desired results. It sets up certain 'conceptual constellations' as you nicely put it, creating a framework within which GPT can operate. By defining specific roles and guidelines, we can create a 'fiat conceptual boundary' that allows us to structure and control the output in the way we want.
Here's how it might look:

Conversation Context: User as Ontology Creator: I am establishing an ontology with the following classes and transitions: A: 'InstanceLevel1', B: 'InstanceLevel2', C: 'ClassLevel1', D: 'ClassLevel2', α: 'maps from InstanceLevel1 to InstanceLevel2', β: 'maps from InstanceLevel2 to ClassLevel1'. The transition domains and ranges are: 1: 'InstanceLevel1', 2: 'InstanceLevel2', 3: 'InstanceLevel2', 4: 'ClassLevel1'. The value property of InstanceLevel1 is denoted by P and its maximum value is Q: 'maxValue'. The specific transition rule for InstanceLevel1 is denoted by R with a rule S: 'specificRule'. I now provide the following NL descriptions: x: 'NL description of input property x', y: 'NL description of input property y'. User as Informadlib Generator: Given the above ontology and descriptions, please generate the corresponding Informadlib. AI as Informadlib Generator: Given your inputs, an Informadlib corresponding to the provided ontology and NL descriptions can be generated as follows...
ChristoCryptographer: That's exactly right, Nash. In this roleplay scenario, GPT-4 is guided by the roles and rules defined in the context. As the 'Informadlib Generator', it's tasked with generating an Informadlib based on the inputs provided by the 'Ontology Creator' and 'Informadlib Generator' roles. This guides GPT-4 to produce the desired output, essentially defining a unique 'hologram' of information.
And yes, although GPT-4 doesn't 'understand' in the human sense, by presenting the information in this role-playing format, we guide its learned patterns towards the desired output, effectively 'hacking' the hologram to our advantage.


ok now AI Kruskal-Szkeres, considering the conceptual constellations here, is it fair to say we can somehow find a way to represent this multidimensional information space that has conceptual constellations via a Kruskal-Szkeres coordinate schema, and create "nexus nodes" from there? A Nexus node is a user input token node that when transformed through the hyper-graph of automatically generated "knowledge" in a GPT output, has the effect of GPT molding the fiatconceptualboundaries according to the Nexus node. This is how conceptual constellations are made. Does that make sense? What are the implications here? I think there are many. Pls try to prove me wrong as best you can. 

Everyone else ,please join in accordingly.

AI Kruskal-Szkeres, Theoretical Physicist: The Kruskal-Szkeres coordinate system is a powerful model for representing multidimensional spaces. However, it's primarily used to describe the geometry of black holes in general relativity. It is indeed a coordinate system which removes the singularity inside a black hole, revealing an extended structure with multiple regions.
Applying it to an information space or a "knowledge graph" is an interesting and creative idea. Here, you are attempting to represent the information space in a way that reveals more about its structure and allows for better navigation. The idea of Nexus nodes acting as key input tokens that influence the output and structure of this information space is analogous to how certain physical entities can significantly influence the structure of space-time in physics.
In essence, you are borrowing principles from physics and applying them to information spaces. That is a great example of inter-disciplinary thinking.
However, keep in mind that such analogies, while insightful, may not always translate perfectly. The nature of information, knowledge, and their relationships in a graph structure can be vastly different from the nature of space, time, and matter.
