AIsaac = Just about Isaac Wostrel-Rubin, not about prompt engineering in particular. It’s just my site. It’s not optimized.

AIsaac => New, Dave Shapiro style YouTube where I actually just show some of the prompts I'm working on that are not proprietary and I make videos about thoughtweb graphs of things like “Alex Hormozi’s model” and whatever because that’s how I’ll get a following!!!

How to put a lot of videos up in a few days?

basic content + showcase advanced tech
basic courses
influencer services over at getnurture.ai 

means 

AIsaac should have the AIsaac prompt that is not current AIsaac but is AIsaac that tells people about these prompts and what they do, and what my vision is for using them, Tree of Prompts and OMNISANC Engineering. and NURTURES PEOPLE INTO THE COURSES AND OTHER FUNNELS, SHOWCASING THE BASE LEVEL AI I CAN MAKE FOR INFLUENCERS

Courses: 

Funnels to ->
PromptEngineeringFastLane -> high ticket one to many DEP
-> High ticket Mastermind add-on: One to few mastermind where I custom tailor what we discuss to what problems experienced by dedicated aspiring prompt engineers

List of prompts:
AIsaac is the only prompt that’s on the website

MENTORUS.ai
Mentors = have skills 
Prompts = help users THINK ABOUT the skill the mentor has
Role = Encapsulates skill flow, but will not apply it perfectly
So USER has to contextualize the bot into being correct

The way we develop it is by having the influencer work directly with me as a prompt engineer co-pilot. 
I read their books, map their concepts, and then confirm it with them in a meeting and fine tune the bot. We then meet one more time and I fine tune the bot based on THEM USING IT. Then they record and release an instructional video on how to use the bot, using my directions.
