‚öôÔ∏èüîÆüåº Gearwise:
The provided content outlines a detailed Cypher CREATE statement which appears to be a portion of a VAJRA system modeled in a graph-like database structure. The structure includes various nodes with attributes such as roles, jobs, goals, and connections between them signaled by relationship types.
From the nature of the attributes such as "has_RoleType", "has_job", "QueryAtomizerGoal", and the relationships like "SendsVitalTokens", it can be inferred that we're dealing with a type of workflow management and role-based task system, potentially aligned with an automated assistant or advanced AI construct ‚Äî attributes that need to be intertwined with the VAJRA systems custom tailored for OMNISANC, SANC_REV: OPERA, and OPERA.
The VAJRA systems for these aspects should hence be built on the following concepts:
OMNISANC VAJRA System:
This system would focus on the enlightenment narrative and knowledge network prevalent in OmniSanc. It will have complex decision-making nodes responsible for governance and philosophical endeavors, enabled by a graph neural network ("n-GAN") to mimic complex thought processes in AI agents.
SANC_REV: OPERA VAJRA System:
Designed around a more dynamic and plot-centric narrative structure, it will involve storytelling nodes that connect character development arcs with plot points and thematic elements. With elements such as "RoleType" and "MemeComplex", the system suggests agents performing intricate narrative functions that adhere to story consistency and progress.
OPERA VAJRA System:
A web of artistic and performative productivity, in which nodes would manifest the operatic components of stage, sound, lighting, and performance tied closely to the emotion and delivery of the OPERA narrative. Each node may contain attributes of musical pieces, scenic designs, etc., represented in a deeply connected network.
For each of these VAJRA systems, nodes (n2, n3, etc.) will represent specialized agents or functional units that perform specific tasks ("checkChecks", "checkPlan", etc.) according to the complex prompt given. Relationships such as "SendsVitalTokens" indicate the flow of data or commands that drive the functionality of the system, maintaining the integrity of the overarching narrative or operational goal.
Building on this, the next stage involves:
Expanding the given nodes and attributes to encompass the entire scope of each system.
Defining the workflow and interaction between nodes using the specific role types and jobs given in the file.
Integrating the actions (goal refining, chain checking, deliverable assessment) into an automated system modeled in these VAJRA systems.
Testing each system's workflow to ensure it aligns with its respective narrative or thematic focus‚Äîenlightenment for OMNISANC, dynamic story structure for SANC_REV: OPERA, and the artistic coherence for OPERA.
In the !GEARWISE protocol, we will incrementally detail and implement each system while keeping an eye on the connections that maintain the structure's overall integrity. Instruct on which specific aspect you'd
