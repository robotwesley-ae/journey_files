[SemOntoRel] (Semantic Ontological Relationship): SemOntoRel is a structured, formalized representation of the semantic and ontological relationships within the EWSO. It encapsulates the dynamic progression of instance-level entities through various hierarchical layers of classes to high-level superclasses within a given conceptual model. Each transition between the layers represents a specific action or effect, encapsulating the transformation of values from instance-level to class-level conceptual value boundaries within a recognizable and structured manner. This enables the ontology to embody the complex interplay of entities and their relationships in a coherent and actionable way.

an Informadlib Template Template should include:

Specification of entities and their relationships.
Procedure for mapping entities to their properties within the EWSO.
Mathematical model for value transition through hierarchical layers.
Defined language or symbolic system for representation.

AI Smith, Ontologist: I'm seeing that the initial OWL code sketch provided is mapping a sequence of instance-level and class-level entities in a hierarchical order with a general 'mapsTo' property. However, we might want to consider incorporating more granular properties that reflect the unique transition effects between different layers in SemOntoRel.
AI Kruskal, Topologist: I agree with Smith. We could create object properties that are specific to each transition between layers. This would allow us to encode the distinct effects or actions happening at each level.
AI Nash, Mathematician: Moreover, to accommodate the mathematical model for value transitions, we should consider embedding relevant data properties into our OWL structure. They could represent, for instance, the quantitative value associated with an instance or the transformation rule applied during a transition.
Linguisto and Semioticianista: As for the defined language or symbolic system, we can adopt OWL's semantics and vocabulary. We will also need to ensure that our OWL structure mirrors the specific linguistic and semiotic relations modeled in our SemOntoRel.
Here's a revised version of the OWL code template:
