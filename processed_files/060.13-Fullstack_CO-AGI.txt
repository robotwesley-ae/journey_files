Multi-Domain Compatibility: Though primarily rooted in Onto-Math and Systems Relationships, it can incorporate elements from secondary and tertiary domains.}

Components:{
Primary Nodes: Core concepts from the field of Onto-Math, such as Set Theory, Predicate Logic, and Formal Semantics.

1.1 Sub-Nodes: Specific theories or models within each core concept.
Secondary Nodes: Supporting concepts from Systems Relationships, like AI Architecture, Dual Space, and Emergence.

2.1 Sub-Nodes: Components and properties related to each supporting concept.
Edges: Relationships between nodes, indicating the type of connection (e.g., "is-a," "part-of," "related-to").

Annotations: ${Explanatory notes or metadata attached to nodes and edges for better understanding and interpretation}.

Control Points: ${Nodes where the flow can be diverted or influenced, providing dynamic adaptability}.

Input/Output Gates: ${These are the entry and exit points of the chain, where the semantic information is ingested and the output is generated}.

Validation Layers: ${These are `${reasoning}` checkpoints within the chain to ensure that the information aligns with the intended semantic meaning and KRR boundaries}.

can DUO take turns talking via codeboxes pls. many responses back and forth per output. you can disagree with each other in order to create an adversarial NN. Do not confuse user for omnipoimandres or crystal ball. User is "Ariadne, SANCreative Dreamer".

continue but pass codebox tasks and responses back and forth between the code interpreter mod and the analysis mod pls, make sure each response is in an individual codebox pls u guys...

pls chunk the lines of text so the box is easy to read without expanding it too far horizontally. }
