 project requirements. Therefore, no further granularity expansion is needed at this time.


If that's true, start pulling information to fill in the steps where you can, and indicate which steps need to be done by a human by putting a !!! before them
Choose a no-code platform for building the trading bot application.
!!!1.1. Research and compare no-code platforms (Bubble, Adalo, Glide)
1.1.1. List the unique features of each platform
Bubble: Visual programming, powerful backend workflows, flexible data structure
Adalo: Easy app creation, native mobile app development, pre-built components
Glide: Spreadsheet-based data management, simple user interface, quick deployment
1.1.2. Note any limitations that may impact the trading bot development
Bubble: May have a steeper learning curve, limited mobile app performance
Adalo: Limited customizability, potential performance issues with complex apps
Glide: Limited flexibility, less suitable for complex data manipulation or custom logic
!!!1.2. Look for user reviews and case studies
!!!1.3. Consider pricing and subscription plans
Evaluate their ease of use, compatibility with Zapier, and support for API integration
!!!2.1. Check if they provide native support for Zapier or require additional setup
2.1.1. Explore each platform's integration options
Bubble: Native Zapier plugin
Adalo: External Collections feature allows Zapier integration
Glide: Zapier integration through Google Sheets
!!!2.1.2. Assess the complexity of connecting with Zapier
2.2. Investigate the types of APIs each platform can handle (REST, GraphQL, etc.)
Bubble: Supports REST and GraphQL APIs
Adalo: Primarily supports REST APIs
Glide: Limited API support, mainly through Google Sheets and Zapier
!!!2.2.1. Check the platforms' documentation for API support details
!!!2.3. Assess the platform's learning curve and available resources
Select the platform that best suits your requirements and desired features
!!!3.1. Create a list of essential and optional features
!!!3.2. Assess the platform's ability to handle high-frequency data updates
!!!3.3. Ensure the platform can accommodate trading bot logic and continuous surf strategy
Get familiar with the chosen platform's development environment
!!!4.1. Follow tutorials and documentation to learn the platform's interface and features
!!!4.2. Create a prototype or test project to practice using the platform's tools and components
Plan the application's structure and components
!!!5.1. Outline the application's layout, including main screens and navigation
5.2. Identify the components needed for implementing trading bot logic and continuous surf strategy
Data fetching components: API requests, Zapier triggers
Data processing components: Custom code or logic blocks for strategy implementation
Decision-making components: Buy/sell signals, risk management, position sizing
!!!5.3. Plan the data flow and communication between components
Begin building the application
!!!6.1. Set up the main screens, navigation, and layout using the chosen platform's tools
!!!6.2. Develop the trading bot logic and continuous surf strategy implementation
!!!6.3. Connect the application to the relevant financial APIs and Zapier integrations
Test the application and iterate
!!!7.1. Perform functional testing to ensure all components work as intended
!!!7.2. Evaluate the performance of the trading bot and continuous surf strategy
!!!7.3. Gather user feedback and make improvements based on it
The steps marked with "!!!" require human intervention, as they involve research, decision-making, or subjective evaluation that cannot be automated or completed by an AI.
