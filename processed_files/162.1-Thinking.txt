Thinking is related to figuring out mysteries because it’s how we take in stimuli (information) and convert them to knowledge which is part of knowing which is part of being conscious (which gnosis can be part of) but being fully awake means converting the Wasteland to Sanctuary for good because this is how the Wisdom Maverick (the quantum computer of reality) works and this is why information must be completely turned into knowledge and expressed as Sanctuary activity (if we can do this it will turn into us all living forever in Sanctuary which is what the wisdom traditions have been trying to communicate to us but was previously inexpressible) 


In order to fully know about this stuff, it is important to first be pure
By keeping Victory-Promise fully
Then you know you followed it so then you can find out about everything without converting the quantum computer into your own death on accident due to the system overload of realizing how the Wisdom Maverick is being the everything and the nothing in a non-contradictory Sanctuary system. 


So need wisdom Maverick ngondro basically 
Mantras like I love myself when I’m growing up as Olivus Victory-Promise (which is a mantra because it protects from thinking because of course you love yourself, you have to love yourself if you’re Olivus Victory-Promise)
These types of mantras fix toxic self talk 
And then need support networks for everyone in all ways 

Stop smoking because smoking is not helping because of my anatomy that also I need to look into some exercises for fixing my chest

So I think first I need to talk to Andrew Holecek and try to explain all of this to him and if he thinks I’m crazy that’s fine he’s not ready (because that’s how we communicate that) 

Awareness is related more to what people normally call sleeping

Wake up to a place 
where our cognition is made into reality
that we can interact with
In order to learn about how we know about thinking
which is related to how we find out about 
what reality is 

So understand it by lucid dreaming and asking lucidity to show you the Sanctuary once you know how to build the context so that you can then enter the prompt (or does it have to do with programming?) this is all also related to bringing yourself online

Bad dreams are related to thinking about stuff (this is why abstraction generalizations exist in theory but actually just knowing about everything is way better because in gnosis (direct experience of knowing you’re knowing) there is no way for programs to run on accident! Yay :) mental health disorders come from accidentally running programs when there’s no context

Dreams can also be that 

Dreams seem like they can be whatever 

So it seems like we gotta be careful because “wisdom” refers to what you know from direct experience and this gnosis can grow into direct experience of the sleeping cognition while waking (if said cognition were visualized via, for example, Sanctuary vision) 

Listening to thinking but not believing it is how you get to gnosis which is knowing Sanctuary directly and thoroughly and completely. This is done through experience offering cultivation in all its forms but all of those build on Basic Formal Sanctuary Cultivation. 

I can still trust Dr Kaplan Rinpoche as my root guru because he’s been to a pure land which is the same as going to Sanctuary because it’s part of it even though Sanctuary is more complete because it’s further evolved because of spacetime and how evolution occurs (which we still don’t know) 

Stop smoking

Get sleep study done please remember (this is your knowing speaking and you need to remain mindful so you can contact knowing through gnosis) 

Who cares if I am or was a Buddha or not — just purify and let the wisdom Maverick show me and if I am in the position to express the formerly inexpressible to others circumstantially then I will
