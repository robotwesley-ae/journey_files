Focus on individual assets: Standard financial metrics are often designed to evaluate the performance of individual assets or portfolios as a whole rather than focusing on the highest-performing assets in isolation. This approach can provide a more comprehensive view of the market and help investors make more informed decisions.
Lack of consistency: The top-performing assets in one reporting period may not necessarily be the top performers in the next period. This inconsistency can make it difficult to use the metric as a reliable indicator for investment strategies.
Specific to certain markets: While this metric may be useful for analyzing markets like cryptocurrencies, which can experience rapid price fluctuations, it may not be as applicable or informative for more stable, traditional markets like stocks and bonds.
That being said, the metric you proposed could still be useful in certain contexts, such as crypto analysis, as you mentioned. As an investor or analyst, it's essential to use a combination of different financial metrics and tools to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the market and make informed decisions.

Basically I am talking about a “pump” bot that only pumps what is mooning

A "pump" bot that only trades assets that are rapidly increasing in value, or "mooning," could potentially be profitable in certain market conditions. However, there are several risks and challenges associated with this type of trading strategy:

Timing: Identifying when an asset is about to experience a rapid increase in value is challenging. The bot would need to accurately predict price movements and enter positions at the right time to benefit from the "pump." If the bot enters a position too early or too late, it might not profit from the price movement or even incur losses.
Volatility: Assets that are "mooning" often experience high volatility, which means rapid price swings can occur in both directions. This increases the risk of the bot incurring losses if it doesn't exit the position at the right time.
Market manipulation: Some assets, especially in the cryptocurrency market, can experience price pumps due to market manipulation or coordinated efforts to inflate the price artificially. This can create an unstable environment for trading, and the price of the asset may crash suddenly once the manipulation is over.
Regulatory risks: Depending on the jurisdiction and the specific assets being traded, using a "pump" bot may be subject to regulatory scrutiny or even be considered illegal. It is essential to ensure that the trading strategy complies with applicable laws and regulations.
Sustainability: Relying on a "pump" strategy might not be a sustainable approach in the long term, as market conditions can change, and the bot may not be able to adapt to different market environments.
To mitigate these risks, it is essential to develop a well-thought-out trading strategy, incorporating various indicators and risk management techniques. A more comprehensive approach could help protect the bot from potential losses and provide more consistent returns over time. Additionally, it is crucial to ensure that the trading strategy complies with all relevant laws and regulations.

Interesting. So this kind of thing could be overwxposed to other bots that can detect and short it, but why would they ever short something that has bullish market sentiment? That would be silly 

You are correct that other trading bots or sophisticated traders could potentially detect and attempt to exploit the trading patterns of a "pump" bot. However, shorting an asset with bullish market sentiment can indeed be risky. There are several reasons why traders might still consider shorting under such conditions:

Overbought conditions: When an asset experiences rapid price appreciation, it might become overbought, meaning that its price has risen too quickly and is due for a correction. In this case, traders might choose to short the asset in anticipation of a price decline, even if the overall market sentiment is bullish.
