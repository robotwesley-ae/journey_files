 linking is the fact that the information DOES connect, chaining is the fact that the connections have types that are themselves linked, and flowing is the fact that the movement of information a prior connects step by step, allows linking and chaining, where chaining is the process of revealing the flows through linking certain links based on synergies

wait so its 3 concepts that come together to create a dual loop of dual looped systems that create an emergent? and we cant really differentiate between whether that emergent is a chain, flow, or link in any ultimate way because they are all co-emergent senses???
