Ordeal - going to see Lama but then meditate and gain realization of meditation 

Bad guys close in - realization that Lama doesnâ€™t have realization of reality

All is lost - realization that Tibetan system cannot grow into the world in its Tibetan imperial form but can still be an emanation of infinite love 

Spark - TWI, the tantra 

Now we are in act 3
