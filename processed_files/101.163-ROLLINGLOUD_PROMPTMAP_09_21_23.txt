Kevin, Chad, and Linda are stuck in a pod at the pinnacle of a Ferris wheel at the Rolling Loud Festival. As time ticks by and assistance seems distant, the urgency to get down becomes palpable. Stranded Situation: Kevin, Chad, and Linda are trapped in a pod at the very top of a Ferris wheel during the Rolling Loud Festival. As time stretches with no sign of rescue, the situation becomes dire. Initial Assessment: Linda, using her keen observational skills, spots a neighboring pod slightly below their position. Chad, with memories of his past climbing adventures, believes they could jump to this pod to initiate their descent. Kevin, wary of the looming dangers, is hesitant but acknowledges the urgency of their predicament. Linda's Unfortunate Leap: Having weighed their options, Chad decides to go first. He carefully positions himself, then leaps to the next pod, landing safely. He signals for the others to follow. As Linda jumps, a gust of wind throws her off balance. She scrambles desperately to grasp something, but to the utter shock of her companions, she plunges into the darkness below. Both Kevin and Chad are paralyzed for a moment, grappling with the horror of what just happened. Chad's Mechanical Misjudgment: Trying to stay focused, Chad spies the Ferris wheel's large counterweight pulley system. Disregarding Kevin's frantic warnings, he leaps onto the counterweight, hoping to slide down. However, the mechanism wasn’t designed for such a sudden weight increase. With a grinding noise and a snap, the counterweight jerks before catapulting Chad away, sending him flying against the festival backdrop before he vanishes amidst the tents below. Kevin's Loneliness and Determination: With his companions seemingly gone, Kevin is engulfed in a profound sense of isolation. But he's now more determined than ever to find a safe way down. Spotting a giant teddy bear in a lower pod, he hatches a plan to use it as a makeshift cushion for his descent. The Beam Walk: Kevin cautiously proceeds along the Ferris wheel’s central beam, leading directly to the teddy bear's pod. Every step is carefully placed, with the harrowing memories of his friends' fates urging him to be meticulous. The Teddy Bear Stunt: Reaching the teddy bear's pod, Kevin swiftly negotiates with the bear's hesitant owner, eventually offering money to secure the fluffy lifesaver. With the teddy bear tightly embraced, Kevin positions himself and leaps off the Ferris wheel. As he nears the ground, he twists mid-air, landing hard on his back with the teddy bear cushioning his fall, absorbing the impact. Ground Reality: Kevin lies winded but intact, staring up at the night sky, still clutching the teddy bear. Just as he starts to process the magnitude of his ordeal, a disheveled Chad, remnants of a festival tent wrapped around him, stumbles over, laughing about his wild descent. To their astonishment, Linda soon joins them, having miraculously landed in an inflatable festival installation. The trio, against all expectations, finds themselves together again, each with their own wild tale of descent. / the above is the version that I like.
