 on a single message.
KEVIN (voiceover) Come on, come on...
Suddenly, a notification chimes, breaking the silence. Kevin's face lights up with relief and joy.
CHAD (excitedly holding up the phone) Yes! They're gonna meet us at the artists-only entrance and sneak us in!
KEVIN (incredulous) Seriously? That's incredible!
LINDA (relieved) Thank goodness! We finally caught a break.
Chad's excitement quickly fades as he delivers a harsh reality.
CHAD (somberly) Linda, you can't come with us. They can't sneak you in. It's just Kevin and me.
KEVIN (resolute) She's come this far. She's not backing down now. We're all going in together.
As they assess their disheveled appearance and lingering odor, Kevin realizes their immediate need.
KEVIN We need to find a hose. We can't meet them looking like this.
CUT TO:
EXT. ROLLING LOUD VENUE - VENUE - DAY
Chad crouches down, his hands gripping what appears to be a fire hydrant or an industrial-sized water source. The determination on his face is undeniable.
CHAD (steadily unscrewing) Almost there, guys.
Kevin's concern is evident as he questions Chad's actions.
KEVIN (nervously) Are you sure about this, Chad? Is it safe?
The suspense builds, the anticipation thick in the air.
CHAD (grinning) Trust me, Kev. Just a little twist, and we'll have a cold shower to refresh ourselves.
With a forceful jolt, the METAL CAP bursts off the hydrant, colliding with Kevin's forehead.
KEVIN (in pain) Owwwwwww!
Water erupts from the opened valve, shooting out with incredible force, resembling a geyser gone wild.
The sheer power of the unleashed water sends them and several festival-goers flying, chaos ensuing in every direction.
EXT. FESTIVAL GROUNDS - DAY
Kevin, Chad, and Linda hurriedly distance themselves from the chaos, their drenched bodies glistening in the sunlight.
KEVIN (clutching his forehead) Like a cold shower? More like a water explosion!
Chad, a wide grin spreading across his face, glances back at the scene of controlled mayhem.
CHAD (laughing) Yeah, like a really big, cold shower.
KEVIN (looking at his soaked clothes) Well, at least we're clean now.
Linda, her wet hair clinging to her face, can't help but join in their laughter.
LINDA (smiling) Hey guys... I guess we've made quite the splash.
write the following into FX: They enter the merch shop, but all that's left are ridiculously expensive Rolling Loud outfits. Despite grumbling about the price, Kevin knows he needs to do whatever it takes to find Zion. An awkward moment ensues as Linda and Chad assume Kevin is paying for their clothes because “we’re kinda helping you find your son.” And Chad says "i did pay for all that vegan food"

INT. ROLLING LOUD MERCH SHOP - DAY
Kevin, Chad, and Linda enter the merch shop, their eyes scanning the racks of clothing. Their weary expressions reveal their desperation to find suitable attire.
The shelves, however, hold nothing but ridiculously expensive Rolling Loud outfits. Kevin's eyebrows furrow, clearly concerned about the exorbitant prices.
KEVIN (groaning) Are they serious with these prices? I can't afford this.
Linda and Chad exchange glances, their own frustration evident.
LINDA (complaining) I can't believe they're charging a fortune for these clothes.
CHAD (nods) Yeah, it's highway robbery. But we need to find Zion, Kevin. We'll figure it out.
An awkward moment ensues as Linda and Chad assume Kevin will foot the bill due to their involvement in finding his son.
LINDA (teasingly) Hey, Kevin, since we're kinda helping you find your son, you'll cover the cost, right?
CHAD (smirking) Yeah, and I did pay for all that vegan food earlier, so consider it a trade-off.
Kevin's face contorts with a mix of surprise and slight annoyance, but he quickly realizes the urgency of the situation.
KEVIN (reluctantly) Alright, alright. But just this once. We'll split the cost, got it?
Linda and Chad exchange victorious glances, grateful for the unexpected assistance.
LINDA (smirking) Deal. Thanks, Kevin. We appreciate it.
CHAD (nods) Yeah, thanks, man. We'll make it up to you.
