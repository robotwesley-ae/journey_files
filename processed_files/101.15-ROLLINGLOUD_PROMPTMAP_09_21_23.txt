EXT. JEREMYâ€™S LIVING ROOM - DAY
Jeremy (47), a slightly uptight dad, is sitting at the kitchen table with his son Zion (13) as they work on homework. Jeremy struggles with algebraic equations, while Zion is distracted by his phone.
ZION (Excitedly) Dad, Rolling Loud just announced their lineup. Can we go? Please?
JEREMY (Confused) What's Rolling Loud?
ZION (Surprised) You don't know what Rolling Loud is?
JEREMY (Shrugs) Should I?
ZION (Excitedly) It's only the biggest hip-hop festival in the world. All the best rappers are gonna be there. Travis Scott, Lil Uzi, Roddy Ricch, Megan Thee Stallion, Post Malone, you name it.
JEREMY (Still lost) And why would we want to go to a festival filled with loud music, drugs, and crowds of people who don't respect personal space?
ZION (Rolls his eyes) Dad, it's not just about the music. It's about the experience. You get to be a part of something bigger than yourself, something that brings people from all over the world together. It's like a celebration of life, you know?
JEREMY (Still skeptical) I don't know, Zion. It doesn't sound like the kind of place I want my 13-year-old son to be.
ZION (Disappointed) Come on, Dad. I've been struggling through school and therapy for years. Can't we have some fun? Plus, you said you wanted to spend more time with me. What better way to bond than over music and culture?
JEREMY (Sighs) Okay, fine. We'll go to this Rolling Loud festival. But I'm going to be very protective and keep an eye on you the entire time.
ZION (Smiling) That's all I ask, Dad. We're gonna have the best time ever.
