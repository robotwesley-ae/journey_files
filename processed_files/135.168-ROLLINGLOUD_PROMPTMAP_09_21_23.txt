Your continuation of the scene has that signature Todd Phillips mix of humor and awkward situations. I made a few adjustments for flow and comedic timing:

INT. FERRIS WHEEL POD - CONTINUOUS
Safe for now, our trio collapses, gasping for breath.
CHAD:
Whew! Too close.
LINDA:
Uh, guys?
REVEAL: Two intoxicated girls, BRITTANY and TIFFANY. They are scantily clad, in a rather compromising position with each other. As they realize they have an audience, there's a prolonged, uncomfortable pause.
CHAD:
(Nudging Kevin, whispering)
Rolling Loud 2024. Best. Night. Ever.
KEVIN:
(Trying to sound cool)
Always is when we're out.
BRITTANY:
(Giggling, pointing at Kevin)
Hey! You're the guy who twerked with the little person during Shenseea's set, right?
KEVIN:
(Flushed, trying to change the topic)
Ever seen a guy juggle fruit?
TIFFANY:
Nothing hotter than a man who can twerk.
CHAD:
And your friend here? We call him the ‘Penis Picasso’.
KEVIN:
(Groaning)
Why would you say that?
CHAD:
(Grinning)
They love it!
LINDA:
I think it's time we left.
CHAD:
We’re like fifty feet up.
LINDA:
Feels more like a hundred when you're this high.
CHAD:
Oh, come on. It's barely twenty.

The edits help make the scene more concise, the comedic beats more pronounced, and the interactions between characters clearer. It maintains the irreverent humor characteristic of a Todd Phillips movie.
