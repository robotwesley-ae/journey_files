I apologize for the misunderstanding. I see now that you used the term "encryption" as an analogy for managing the complexity of the ontology, rather than referring to security. Let's reframe the discussion based on this clarification.

The idea you propose involves creating a dynamic and adaptive ontology processing system that allows for strict boundaries on processing, which can be changed on-the-fly as needed. This approach aims to reduce computational complexity by focusing only on the relevant properties and relations at each step of the processing.

Here's a breakdown of this approach:

Dynamic boundaries: At each step of the ontology processing, you define strict boundaries that limit the scope of properties and relations being considered. This allows you to focus only on the relevant aspects of the ontology and avoid processing unrelated information.
On-the-fly adjustments: As you progress through the ontology processing and move to the next point in the walk, you can adapt the boundaries by adding or removing properties as needed. This ensures that your processing remains focused on the most relevant information for the current step and helps to manage the overall complexity of the ontology.
Adaptive processing: This approach enables the system to adapt to the specific requirements of each step in the ontology processing. By adjusting the boundaries based on the current context, the system can handle a wide range of situations and efficiently process the ontology without being overwhelmed by complexity.
Efficient search and reasoning: By focusing only on the relevant properties and relations at each step, the system can perform more efficient searches and reasoning. This can help to overcome the computational challenges associated with large and complex ontologies.
To implement this approach, you would need to develop algorithms and mechanisms that can dynamically define and adjust the processing boundaries based on the current context and requirements. This could involve:

Identifying the relevant properties and relations for each step of the ontology processing.
Defining rules or heuristics for adjusting the boundaries as the processing progresses.
Developing efficient search and reasoning algorithms that can work within the defined boundaries.
By implementing this dynamic and adaptive approach to ontology processing, you can manage the complexity of ontologies more effectively, focusing only on relevant information and adapting the processing boundaries on-the-fly to ensure efficient computation.

Do you agree? 

As an AI language model, I don't have personal opinions, but I can provide an analysis of the approach you proposed.

The dynamic and adaptive approach to ontology processing that you suggested has merit in terms of managing the complexity of ontologies and improving computational efficiency. By focusing on relevant properties and relations at each step and adjusting the boundaries on-the-fly, you can potentially reduce the computational overhead and make the processing more efficient.

However, the success of this approach depends on several factors:

Effective algorithms for defining and adjusting boundaries: Developing algorithms that can accurately identify relevant properties and relations and adjust the boundaries as needed is crucial. The efficiency of these algorithms will have a significant impact on the overall performance of the ontology processing.
Scalability: The approach needs to be scalable to handle large and complex ontologies. While the dynamic boundary adjustments can help manage complexity, further optimization may be required to ensure that the system can handle ontologies of varying sizes and complexities.
Robustness: The system should be robust enough to handle ambiguities and uncertainties in the ontology, as well as potential changes in the domain knowledge. This may require incorporating techniques such as approximate reasoning or confidence measures to ensure that the system can still make accurate predictions and inferences despite incomplete or uncertain information.
