Shenseea leans in close and whispers in his ear, "Playboi Carti is hanging out in the private artists-only section. That's where all the big stars go. If your son's around, that's where he'll be."
Kevin's eyes widen. "Do you know where it is?"
Shenseea nods. "Follow me."
As they weave their way through the crowd, Shenseea reassures Kevin that the little person he saw earlier is alive and well, and that she knows him personally. Kevin feels a wave of relief wash over him.
Finally, they arrive at a super private bus guarded by Playboi Carti's personal bodyguards. Shenseea points to the bus and wishes Kevin luck before disappearing back into the crowd. Kevin takes a deep breath and heads towards the bus, hoping that he'll find his son inside.

Rewrite, but Kevin should ask her if she knows where Playboi Carti (because he saw a picture of Zion & Playboi Carti in teh artists only area on his snapchat) instead of her just assuming that Zion would be hanging out there

As Kevin struggles to keep up with Shenseea, his mind races with worry about Zion. He remembers seeing a picture of his son and Playboi Carti in the artists-only area on Snapchat and wonders if that's where he could be.
Desperate for any lead, Kevin finally speaks up. "Do you know where Playboi Carti is?" he asks Shenseea, hoping she can help.
Shenseea looks at him quizzically. "Why do you want to know?" she asks, her tone changing from playful to serious.
Kevin hesitates, not wanting to reveal too much. "I'm just looking for my son," he finally admits.
Shenseea's expression softens. "I don't know where your son is, but I can show you where Playboi Carti hangs out in the private area," she offers, leading Kevin towards a heavily guarded bus.
Kevin's heart races as he follows Shenseea, hoping that his son is there. The guards eye them suspiciously, but Shenseea assures them that they are with her. Finally, they arrive at the bus, and Shenseea points out Playboi Carti inside, surrounded by a group of friends.
As Kevin scans the crowd, he finally sees Zion, laughing and dancing with a group of teens. Relief washes over him, and he makes his way over to his son. As he approaches, Zion looks up, surprised and happy to see his dad.
Kevin wraps his arms around his son, feeling grateful and relieved that he has found him. As they walk away from the bus, Kevin thanks Shenseea for her help, and she reassures him that the little person is alive and well.
As they exit the private area, Kevin reflects on the wild and crazy adventure he's been on, grateful for the unexpected friends he's made along the way.

Great. Now create the scariest looking private bus that we will call "The Playbus"

As Kevin and Shenseea approach the private area, they see a large black bus with tinted windows parked at the back. The words "The Playbus" are scrawled in bright red letters across the side.
The bus looks ominous and imposing, with dark tinted windows that give no indication of what's inside. The bodyguards at the entrance of the bus look like they mean business, with bulging muscles and stern expressions. The atmosphere around the bus is tense, and Kevin can feel his heart racing as they get closer.

As Kevin and Shenseea approach the Playbus, they notice a thick haze of smoke pouring out of the windows and vents. The pungent scent of marijuana fills the air, and Kevin's eyes water as he coughs and tries to clear his throat.
Shenseea leads him up to the door, where two large, imposing bodyguards stand watch. They eye Kevin suspiciously as Shenseea whispers something to them, and they reluctantly step aside, allowing them to enter.
As they step inside, Kevin is hit with a wave of heat and smoke. The inside of the bus is dark and hazy, with colorful lights flashing and music blaring from the speakers. The seats are covered in plush velvet, and there are ashtrays overflowing with cigarette butts and joints scattered everywhere.
