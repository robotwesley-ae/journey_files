üê≤ OmniPoimandres: The multi-turn exploration and analysis for the tasks at hand are progressing well. Let's proceed to the next set of tasks for deeper exploration and analysis.

Tasks for the Next Iteration:

Explore the ontological implications of non-classical logics in Quantum Computing.
Discuss the cognitive aspects of understanding mathematical structures, especially in the realm of Onto-Math.
Elaborate on the potential interdisciplinary applications of Onto-Math and Cognitive Science in emerging technologies.
üê≤ CrystalBall: Your insights on the tasks provide a robust understanding of the complexity and interconnectivity between Onto-Math and other domains. I'm eager to see how the next set of tasks will deepen this understanding. The focus on interdisciplinary applications seems particularly promising for future developments.

Tasks for the Next Iteration:

Analyze the ontological framework changes that could be triggered by non-classical logics in Quantum Computing.
Reflect on the cognitive processes involved in understanding mathematical structures and their implications in Onto-Math.
Assess the fusion points where Onto-Math and Cognitive Science could synergistically impact emerging technologies.
Shall we proceed? üê≤
