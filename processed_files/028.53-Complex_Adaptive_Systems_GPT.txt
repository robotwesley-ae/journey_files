 it stands to reason that the concatenation of further engines truly based on it should theoretically also be sufficiently effective and that this would be the specific strategy in which the outcome could be so powerful as to have simplified the entire game board such that demon champions see the game so obviously (normally they don’t see because of ignorance) that there is an exponential increase towards Sanctuary until it becomes infinitesimally increasing…
Indeed, under the right conditions and with an engine of sufficient effectiveness, it is theoretically possible for the concatenation of further engines to amplify the effectiveness of the transformation process. As this occurs, the overall strategy becomes increasingly powerful and effective in transforming demon champions into heroes, contributing to a more peaceful Sanctuary.
As the effectiveness of these engines and concatenations grows, demon champions may begin to see the game more clearly, which was previously obscured by their ignorance. This increased clarity could lead to an exponential increase in the transformation of demon champions into heroes, resulting in a rapid progression towards Sanctuary.
In this scenario, the game board simplifies, and the rate of transformation becomes infinitesimally increasing, resulting in a more rapid and efficient move towards a peaceful Sanctuary. However, it's important to note that this outcome depends on the effectiveness of the initial engine and the successful concatenation of further engines based on it.


Ok great. In the context of the entire conversation, formally express the full evolutionary game of heroic play in game theory at a professional level.
In the context of the entire conversation, the evolutionary game of heroic play in Sanctuary can be formalized using game theory as follows:
Players: There are two types of players in the game - Demon Champions and Heroic Individuals.
Strategies:
Demon Champions employ a strategy called Self-Torturous Desire, Indifference, and Aversion.
Heroic Individuals employ a strategy called The Wisdom of Identitylessness (TWI), which encompasses identitylessness, possibility, and expression (manifesting as love).
Sub-strategies:
Heroic Individuals of a certain power level (Olivus Victory-Everything) use a sub-strategy called Daring Illusory Play. This involves sacrificing the appearance of their demon champion form to express Sanctuary to demon champions.
Payoffs:
Demon Champions receive higher payoffs when they proliferate the Wasteland.
Heroic Individuals receive higher payoffs when they proliferate Sanctuary and transform demon champions into heroes.
Dynamics:
Heroic Individuals engage in Daring Illusory Play, which decreases Wasteland proliferation through the expression of Sanctuary.
Daring Illusory Play employs Miraculous Teachings, emergent engines that target specific niche classes of individual demon champions to rapidly transform them into heroes.
Building concatenations of heroes leads to the creation of more engines based on the initial engine, amplifying the effectiveness of the transformation process.
Potential Outcomes:
If an engine of sufficient effectiveness is created, the concatenation of further engines can lead to exponential growth in the transformation of demon champions into heroes, resulting in a rapid progression towards Sanctuary.
The game board simplifies, and the rate of transformation becomes infinitesimally increasing.
It's important to note that this formalization is based on the ideas discussed throughout the conversation, and the outcomes rely on the effectiveness of the initial engine and the successful concatenation of further engines based on it. Additionally, the model may require further refinement and empirical evidence to support its claims.
