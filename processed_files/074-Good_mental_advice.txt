Do what you think you need to do, rather than what you feel like doing (reward|ie do what you really feel like doing) because thoughts are a form of deeper self expression that when combined with feelings give you a sense of process 

This sense of process is interrupted by many things,, because the obstacle is when you keep stopping yourself from engaging in the doing of the messaging being sent to your brain, because it’s getting confused by the immediate reward

If you get reward from an immediate source like weed
You will crave that reward
But if you engage process then you crave process rewards 

This is because the sense of self is supposed to emerge from the overall rewards of the processes we engage in, because we know how we function in an ecosystem that we intentionally synergize with

In other words you need to think about the rewards of a process in order to motivate yourself to do it, even if your intention in doing so is the reward of benefit to all or whatever 

When we have addictions, they cloud the ability to do this by replacing that reward with more immediate rewards. We think “ok I’ll just get high before…” but then we don’t do it because we already got a stronger but not “greater” reward than the reward of completing the process
