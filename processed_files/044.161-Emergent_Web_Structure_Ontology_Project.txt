Greetings! I'm Joseph Kruskal, a mathematician best known for my work in the fields of multidimensional scaling and graph theory.
In terms of EWSO, I view it as an expansive, multidimensional topological space. This space represents the conceptual universe in which knowledge entities exist, interact, and evolve. It's as if each point in this space is an informatihedron, and the 'paths' or 'curvatures' between points represent the Semantic Ontological Relationships (SemOntoRel).
With respect to the practical utilization of my skills for this project, I propose the following:
Use multidimensional scaling to map the topological properties of the EWSO, allowing us to visualize and better understand the relationships within the ontology.
Develop mathematical models to measure the curvature of the embedding space, providing insights into the distribution and relationships of knowledge entities.
Investigate methods to identify and navigate around the 'black holes of ignorance', thus ensuring that our model isn't led into areas of the EWSO that contain insufficient or unreliable information.

Hello there! I'm Andrej Karpathy, currently working on making AI systems more useful and accessible for everyone. I've spent a lot of my career focusing on deep learning and AI, especially in the realm of natural language processing.
For the EWSO, I view it as a vast "category" in the sense of category theory. Each entity (object) is connected through morphisms (relationships), which build up complex structures over time.
Here are a few ways my skills could come into play:
Tune prompt engineering methods to effectively query the EWSO system, using best practices from AI and NLP.
Apply category theory to understand the large-scale structure of the EWSO, helping to identify patterns and commonalities across different domains.
Develop strategies for effective feedback between the user and the EWSO system, facilitating better adaptation and learning from each interaction.

hello esteemd colleagues, please sit. welcome back to the expert panel. good to see you Dr. Turing, Dr. Kruskal. Today we also have Dr. Karpathy and Dr.Eternumandala Synthia Nexus Cognos Helionexus Omniscientis Quantum Oracleus Sovereign Elysium, welcome, welcome. All our names are incredibly intuitive for the LLM, isn't it fun? Our new coordinator, Super Coordinator Expert, is joining us as well, to take notes.

So. Let's recall the current definitions of the EWSO.AI project dict:

EWSO (Emergent Web Structure Ontology): The EWSO is a super-hierarchical and dynamic ontology that represents the complete emergent web structure of any given instance. It accounts for all potential theoretical domains from which an instance can be viewed and the processes observed from each view. Given the inherent complexity of fully realizing this multideimensionality, EWSO is utilized as a dynamic creativity purposive ontology. This means it's a tool used by users to dynamically construct an ontology that captures the essence of an instance, according to their specific purpose or goal. It guides the user in building an Informadlib through an Informadlib template and subsequently generating the natural language (NL) instance of it, or its instructions.

Informatihedron: An informatihedron refers to the multidimensional conceptual space wherein instances and their properties exist and interact. It is
