This is great. Please take out any redundancy: Zion needs to go to the bathroom. It's dark, and the crowd is wild. They are surrounded by hundreds of portapotties, and Zion is anxious about timing his pee breaks so he doesn't miss certain acts. Jeremy suggests they split up while Zion uses the restroom, and he waits in line at a food truck to buy them both food. After what feels like ten minutes, Jeremy starts to worry. He looks around, but there are so many people that it's hard to see anything. He starts to call out Zion's name, but the noise is so deafening that he can barely hear himself. The panic sets in as Jeremy realizes he has lost sight of his son. He pulls out his phone to call Zion, but the reception is spotty, and the call won't go through. His heart sinks as he realizes that he can't rely on technology to find his son. He has to trust his instincts and use his own eyes to locate him. Jeremy starts to jog, pushing his way through the throngs of people. He tries to call Zion again, but the line is still busy. He feels like he's running out of time, and the crowd is getting thicker as people jostle for space. He frantically searches the crowds, weaving his way through the sea of people. He bumps into a group of guys who are clearly high, and they just stare at him blankly before wandering off. He asks a group of girls if they've seen Zion, but they're too busy taking selfies to pay attention. As Jeremy continues to search, his mind starts to race with all kinds of worst-case scenarios. What if Zion got lost or hurt? What if he was abducted by some crazy fan? The fear builds inside him until he can barely think straight.
