By using these specific prompts, you can guide Auto-GPT to create a focused plan for building a startup, achieving early profitability, and scaling into various verticals.


based on the lean startup methodology of eric ries, right? we should also combine it with PG and Sam Altman's startup principles and keep in mind Peter Thiel's ideas from Zero to One. Likewise, we should pay special attention to Alex Hormozi's concept of $100m offers. Can you revise accordingly? Do you know all those systems im mentioning?
Yes, I am familiar with the lean startup methodology by Eric Ries, Paul Graham (PG) and Sam Altman's startup principles, Peter Thiel's ideas from Zero to One, and Alex Hormozi's concept of $100m offers. I can revise the prompts accordingly:
"Using the lean startup methodology by Eric Ries, Paul Graham and Sam Altman's startup principles, Peter Thiel's ideas from Zero to One, and Alex Hormozi's concept of $100m offers, create a business plan for an AI-based startup utilizing Auto-GPT technology. Focus on early profitability and the build-measure-learn cycle to fund further development and processing."
"Analyze cost-effective and profitable marketing strategies for promoting Auto-GPT, considering lean startup principles and $100m offers. Identify key value propositions that resonate with the target audience and lead to early adoption."
"Develop a financial plan, incorporating ideas from Zero to One and lean startup principles, to allocate the initial budget towards development, marketing, and operations. Ensure early profitability and outline strategies to reinvest profits into the business to improve processing capabilities and scale operations."
"Identify potential verticals and industries that would benefit from Auto-GPT technology, keeping in mind startup principles from PG, Sam Altman, and Peter Thiel. Create a plan to expand the startup into these verticals, leveraging the increased processing capabilities funded by profits generated from early operations."
"Describe how the startup can continuously iterate and improve its Auto-GPT offerings, using the build-measure-learn cycle and adapting to customer feedback and market demands. Incorporate insights from Zero to One, lean startup principles, and $100m offers to ensure long-term growth and sustainability."
These revised prompts incorporate the requested methodologies and principles, guiding Auto-GPT to create a focused plan for building a successful startup.


Thats not specific enough. Try going into which parts of each theoretician's ideas should be used and how. Let's focus on the first prompt you came up with, but also turn it into a number of steps to ensure that AutoGPT doesnt have to do too much self-prompting at first and can start in a zero'd in way
I understand that you want to have more specific guidance for Auto-GPT to reduce the need for self-prompting. Here's a more detailed and step-by-step version of the first prompt, focusing on specific ideas from each theoretician:
"Using Eric Ries' lean startup methodology, begin by identifying the core problem Auto-GPT is solving and the target customer segment. Define the minimum viable product (MVP) that can be quickly developed and tested in the market."
"Apply Paul Graham's startup principles to create a strong founding team with diverse skill sets and a shared vision for Auto-GPT. Identify roles and responsibilities that leverage each team member's strengths and experiences."
"Following Sam Altman's advice, focus on building a product that users love. Implement a continuous feedback loop to collect user feedback and iterate on the product based on that feedback. Also, prioritize growth and user retention in the early stages."
"Incorporate Peter Thiel's ideas from Zero to One by establishing a strong value proposition and differentiators that set Auto-GPT apart from competitors. Focus on creating a monopoly within a niche market before expanding."
"Use Alex Hormozi's concept of $100m offers to develop a compelling and high-value offer for customers. Structure the pricing and packaging in a way that maximizes customer lifetime value and encourages long-term commitment to the platform."
