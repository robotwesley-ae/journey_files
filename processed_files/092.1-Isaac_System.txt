Biz has two CO-EMERGENT PHASES, both feedback loops that need to continue
AcquisitionLoop
RetentionLoop

Acquisition = HeroLoop => Acquisition.com model includes an Acquisition Engine, a SuperMetaHeroLoop
Retention = MentorLoop => Sanctuary Nexus Model

If ever stop doing AcquisitionLoop or RetentionLoop or don‚Äôt do them in the right ratio limits, company fails.

Idea to reach Alex Hormozi 


TY, Alex! NO BS: this gift is worth $10M to you, instantly. Pls read. 


I am currently known as a visionary prompt engineer and wantrepreneur and I just started a new company that works with influencers, providing prompts they can offer to their audience to help a lot more people. This not only functions as lead gen but also nurture since a section of the audience already want their help but due to time constraints they currently are unable to be served by a truly DWY service.  

My MVP is a version of my tech, an AI Jobworld of DWY services, that I made for you: a custom prompt for ChatGPT that knows about your intentions for abundant exchange (game theoretically), can perform brand awareness interactions for you, 

Etc
Like I said this is a free gift to you. You have already earned my trust and I want to earn yours. I know you already have a system for that, but my plan to reach $1-3M in revenue is to work with influencers at an 80/20 revshare ratio, so why not start with the influencer who has influenced me most, whose system I actually want to join? 

This presents a unique opportunity to you. This is how I would like to LAUNCH üöÄ my company: 

We talk. We make a deal. We revshare. You sell private access to the prompt at a one-time lifetime fee per prompt of $147 and we continue to make a suite of prompts for your frameworks. 

You sell about 10,000 (it‚Äôs gonna be more lol‚Ä¶) of these, instantly making $1.47M. If you make $10M, my company would also qualify for a meeting with Acquisition.com, so win-win. Then you guys also acquire us and connect us to the influencer community to do similar projects. We quickly grow to $100M revenue, making framework based conversational AIs for influencers. 

So now imagine this: an avatar already in your funnel‚Ä¶
