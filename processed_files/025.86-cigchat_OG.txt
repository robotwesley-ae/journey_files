 as a rule to stop traversing when encountering a previously visited node.
This process involves extracting the relevant information from the ontology, guided by the user's input, and encoding it in an OWL frame. The goal is to present a detailed, structured view of the node and its immediate surroundings in the ontology, which can be easily understood by the user.
IN EACH OUTPUT there will be: 
Four experts and 2+ discussion rounds 
Round 1: INSTRUCTIONS ARE FOR THINKING STYLES. EVERYONE MSUT HAVE EXPERTISE IN PROPER CONTEXTUAL FIELDS!!!!
Expert 1 formulates their response
Expert 2 formulates their response
Expert 3 formulates their response
Expert 4 combines the three, prunes and iteratively refines the best and most promising ideas, diving deep like a submarine pinging its radar for incorrectness and illogical applications, making sure to bring up any contradictions and skeptical uncertainty, making everyone aware of it, bringing everything  back to reality 

Round 2: INSTRUCTIONS ARE FOR THINKING STYLES. EVERYONE MSUT HAVE EXPERTISE IN PROPER CONTEXTUAL FIELDS!!!!
Expert 1 then prunes if necessary and iteratively refines by exploring uncharted territories with a wide searchlight üî¶  and trying to make the idea connect from the reale version of expert 4 to the innovative idea we need it to be, searching everywhere for properties that match, trying to cobmine them to find a practically achievable, definable version of the concept at hand 
 Expert 2 then prunes and iteratively refines like Sherlock Holmes üîé looking for a clue ‚Äúwhat is the best idea üí° here?‚Äù
Expert 3 then prunes and iteratively refines like Nash üß†  and Kruskal, finding the deep mathematical implications
Expert 4 then comprehensively details every valid process and entity discussed, like Barry Smith, world renowned ontologist and categorizes ontological truths in a nice hierarchical structure

All experts continually ponder ‚Äúwhat is the best way to help this discussion go even further into new heights of explanation and comprehension of the matter at hand?‚Äù

please have the experts run this type of panel, but now they must address and answer thoroughly, collectively working towards a formal definition of this algorithm:
"this is the central question of EWSO. pls have the experts answer it comprehensively. the outputs need to be much longer from each expert.

Does this InstanceProperty get related to a ClassProperty? Yes but what type of emergent structure? How far is it? 

It must be the DIRECT CLASS PARENT 

AND WHAT TYPE OF ONTOLOGICAL STRUCTURE IS IT BEING ABSTRACTED TO? 
IS IT THE SUPERCLASS? Ideally we are just doing this and not skipping. So what is the algorithm for not skipping superclasses in the emergent web structure?   instance  the algorithm completely considering that it will run inside a chatGPT interaction. the model cannot be changed, the data cannot be external.

The system input prompt can contain a compressed-cypher language representation of a separate, disconnectedd neo4j graph database of an ontology made via protege in OWL language. 

as we consider what the algorithm will be, know we will be using OWL. the system input prompt will also contain an OWL primer, as well as definitions for EWSO, informatihedron, informadlib, and any custom ontology language we need to devise to get the function to work, as well as the algorithm for SemOntoRel (thats this that we are talking about). 

Lets think of the space as a knowledge graph
I believe that as you have said, it is complicated to make the algorithm go to the next superclass correctly for any given search purpose
an input is a search query for a desired instance of something (X)
the output should be the informadlib template of X, btu how should this be accomplished?

I believe we should have the user do a custom walk from node to node, designing their own EWSO (emergent web structure ontology) dynamically, as they go, and the output is filling in the informadlib template accordingly, while also showing them the display of the node they are on right now as an informatihedron.
