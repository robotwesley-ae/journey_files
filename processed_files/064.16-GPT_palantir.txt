The scale of computing XYK in the example given (aligning notes from the book "Gym Launch" by Alex Hormozi with the book's content and the broader business domain) would likely be smaller than the general estimates provided earlier. Let's adjust the budget estimates accordingly, focusing on the software, processing, and infrastructure costs.

Software and tools:
Ontology development tools (e.g., Protégé, WebVOWL): Open-source/free or commercial licenses ranging from $0 to $500 per year.
Graph database (e.g., Neo4j): Open-source/community edition or commercial licenses ranging from $0 to $5,000 per year, depending on the required features, support, and scalability.
GPT-4 API usage: Considering the smaller scale, you might expect costs between $50 and $500 per month, depending on the volume of API calls and level of access required.
Processing and infrastructure:
Cloud computing resources: With the smaller scale and complexity of the project, you might need fewer cloud computing resources. Costs for cloud platforms such as AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure can range from $50 to $500 per month, depending on your requirements.
Model training and fine-tuning: The scale of the project and the level of fine-tuning required would likely be smaller, so you might expect costs between $500 and $5,000 for training and fine-tuning.
The adjusted total estimated budget, considering both human and non-human costs for this specific example, could range from $9,600 to $47,000. However, it's important to remember that these estimates are still rough and could vary depending on the specific requirements, the choice of tools and platforms, and the extent of GPT-4 usage.

Remember that we need to align every domain involved in K with each other in order to make K

Apologies for the oversight. Aligning every domain involved in K with each other adds another layer of complexity to the project, which will likely increase the time and resources required. Let's adjust the estimates for this additional step:

Meta-alignment of domains within K:
Retrieval, extraction, and ontology creation for each domain in K (with GPT-4 assistance): 80-160 hours
Developer hourly rate: $50-$100
Subtotal: $4,000-$16,000
Cross-domain alignment and merging of ontologies within K (with GPT-4 assistance): 100-200 hours
Developer hourly rate: $50-$100
Subtotal: $5,000-$20,000
Adjusted estimates for software, processing, and infrastructure costs:
Considering the increased complexity of aligning multiple domains within K, the costs for software and tools, as well as processing and infrastructure, may be higher. You might expect a 25-50% increase in these costs.
With these adjustments in mind, the revised total estimated budget for the specific example, including both human and non-human costs, could range from approximately $19,100 to $92,500. As before, these estimates are still rough and could vary depending on the specific requirements, the choice of tools and platforms, and the extent of GPT-4 usage.

Ok what about if we were doing a different project, where X = an unknown but theoretically maximally profitable trading strategy for the current market conditions, Y is the trading strategy domain, XY is the conditionally optimal theoretic strategy, XYK is the instruction set for creating a trading bot to execute strategy XY

In this new project scenario, the goal is to develop an optimal trading strategy (X) for the current market conditions, align it with the trading strategy domain (Y), and create an instruction set (XYK) for a trading bot to execute the strategy. The budget estimates will be different from the previous example, as the focus and complexity of the project have changed. Here are rough estimates for this new scenario:

Research and development of the optimal trading strategy (X):
Market analysis, data collection, and strategy development: 200-400 hours
Analyst/developer hourly rate: $50-$100
Subtotal: $10,000-$40,000
Aligning the optimal trading strategy (X) with the trading strategy domain (Y):
Ontology development for the trading strategy domain: 80-160 hours
Developer hourly rate: $50-$100
Subtotal: $4,000-$16,000
