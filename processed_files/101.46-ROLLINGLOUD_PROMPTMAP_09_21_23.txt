As they start to walk away, Jeremy realizes that he's lost his phone. He retraces his steps, trying to find it, but it's nowhere to be seen. He's upset, but he also realizes that losing his phone might not be such a bad thing. Maybe he needs to disconnect for a while and focus on what's really important: his relationship with his son.

rewrite but include a very high Chad as his wingman on this journey

As Jeremy's anger fuels his determination to find Zion, he turns to Chad, who's now also high as a kite, to be his wingman on this journey. Together, they stumble through the crowd, asking anyone and everyone if they've seen a teenage boy with curly hair and a bright red shirt.
Jeremy's intoxication and highness start to take a toll on him, as he struggles to keep his balance and maintain focus. Chad isn't doing much better, as he keeps getting distracted by shiny objects and people in elaborate costumes.
At one point, they spot a group of teenagers who look like they could be Zion's friends. Jeremy and Chad approach them, and Jeremy demands to know where his son is. The teenagers just laugh at him and taunt him, telling him that Zion is with them and they're having a great time.
This only angers Jeremy more, and he starts to get physical with the teenagers. Chad tries to hold him back, but he's too high to be of much help. The teenagers quickly overwhelm them, and they're left bruised and humiliated once again.
As they stumble away from the group of teenagers, Jeremy realizes that he needs to calm down and get his head straight if he's going to find Zion. He turns to Chad and tries to come up with a plan.
Chad suggests that they split up and search different areas of the festival grounds. Jeremy agrees, but as soon as they part ways, he gets distracted by the sights and sounds of the festival. He ends up at a food vendor, where he orders a plate of nachos and a giant margarita.
He tries to text Chad to see if he's found anything, but his fingers are too clumsy and he ends up sending a jumbled mess of letters and emojis. He decides to just sit down and wait for Chad to come back to him.
As he munches on his nachos and sips his margarita, he starts to feel better. The high and the alcohol have taken the edge off, and he's able to relax for the first time all night.
Chad eventually finds him, and they compare notes. Chad hasn't found anything, but he did make a new friend who's a big fan of Will Ferrell movies. Jeremy chuckles at this, but then his face turns serious.
"We need to find Zion," he says, determined once again. "We can't leave here without him."
Chad nods in agreement, and they set off once again, weaving their way through the crowds and searching for any sign of Zion. Despite their setbacks, they're not ready to give up yet. They'll keep searching until they find him, no matter what.

Okay. Now rewrite this section from the moment they receive the clue
ChatGPT
Jeremy's phone buzzes, and he sees a text from Zion. He eagerly opens it, hoping that his son has finally reached out to him.
The text reads: "Hey dad, I'm okay. Hanging out with some new friends. Don't worry about me."
Jeremy's heart sinks. Zion has actively chosen to separate from him and is out there with strangers. He can't believe that his son would do this to him. He feels a mix of anger and sadness.
Chad tries to reassure him, but he's also feeling the effects of the alcohol and drugs. The two stumble around the festival grounds, trying to retrace their steps and find any sign of Zion.
But their inebriated state makes things difficult. Jeremy keeps getting sidetracked, wanting to stop and dance to every song he hears. Chad, meanwhile, keeps getting lost in the crowds and wandering off on his own.
At one point, Jeremy spots a group of teenagers who look like they might know Zion. He charges over to them, demanding to know if they've seen his son. The teenagers just look at him like he's crazy and tell him to back off.
Chad tries to intervene, but he's too high to really be of any help. He starts laughing uncontrollably at everything and nothing, drawing attention to himself and Jeremy.
