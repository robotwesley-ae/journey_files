The Chronological Story (GO THRU EMAILS AND FIND ALL COMMUNICATIONS AND MAKE A LIST OF CONTENT)
First met Dr Kaplan
We talked about Ancient Greek and Prussian Philosophy
He gave me his card and said let’s get tea
We had our first meeting at French Cafe
He showed me Vimalakirti’s Throne
Did not give me a copy
Told me he had thousands of students across the world
Told me the stories of some of the photos in the book and the dohas
Asked me what I thought of the last photo, of the place he was app   arently from in a past life
Told him about my experiences with meditation and he said those are confusing if you tell the wrong person but they arent like “rigpa” itself
Told me about 8 auspicious ones
Then we had things scheduled for 2nd meeting and I got my new job at 13RY after being fired and canvasing… so we couldnt meet and I had to go
I emailed him
Shadpa gave me vajra armor so I had to do the starting retreat for it each night
Adding in 8 auspicious ones
I stopped and prayed with 8 auspicious ones, then sent him an email thanking him and so on and asked him to give me meditation instruction I think
Got back home and second meeting
Sangye Lingpa Vajrasattva
Practiced that every day
Local Protectors
Lungjon
Dudjom Ngondro
Sent him the copy of KHENPO GANGSHAR NATURALLY LIBERATING WHATEVER YOU MEET
Tell little story about my hesitance
How he helped me calm down
Showed me his letter from KTR
Show emails he sent
Told him I was feeling these weapon chakras whirling in my visualizations in Senge dongma and he said STOP
Got my job at BTM and was doing protectors every day and so on there per instructions and saying mantras for all the dead moths etc
Asked him for magic formula to liberate the beings
He said there isnt, suggested a prayer wheel
He gave me Vajrakilaya
He told me my dreams were bad because I was able to control them: i was on a diet and i was being mindful all day long about these things and i was getting lucidity back in my dreams and I was dreaming about delicious foods, MARA!!, and not eating them
Too much thinking he said: why arent you enjoying yourself in your dreams? Thats like the sambhogakaya so obviously you are really confused
Too much thinking about dharma makes you have dreams about dharma
And too mcu hthinking makes you aware in your dreams such that your neurosis is seeping into them and you’re not actually dreaming correctly
This killed me. I wasn’t able to do dream yoga again… until I had the dream in NICA about Dudjom R3… I really loved him so much. Everyone in my mind does...
I got the phurbas made by Phub
Gave me Troma
Gave me the “secret instruction for Vajrakilaya”
Told me the phurbas were gongter
I would ask him for practices and sometimes he would give them and sometimes he would ask why I want them or just say no because he thought them unnecessary
I ended up with a full textbook “DAILY PRACTICE”
FUNNEL: Which is available for those with empowerments…
