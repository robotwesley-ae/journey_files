 hearts sink as they see a line of people being checked for identification.
A stern GUARD stands at the entrance, meticulously examining each person's ID.
GUARD (looking at Zion) How old is he?
KEVIN He's 13, but I'll be with him the whole time. Please, can't you make an exception?
GUARD No exceptions. No one under 16 gets in.
KEVIN But we've come so far. We just want to experience this together.
GUARD Sorry, sir. It's festival policy. Rules are rules.
KEVIN But he's been looking forward to this. We won't cause any trouble.
GUARD We have to ensure everyone's safety and enjoyment. Age restrictions are in place for a reason.
Kevin's face falls, his eyes darting between the guard and Zion, searching for a glimmer of hope.
KEVIN Please, we just want to create lasting memories together.
GUARD I understand, but I can't make any exceptions. It wouldn't be fair to others.
Kevin's voice quivers with disappointment.
KEVIN I get it. We tried our best.
Zion's face reflects his crushed dreams, the vibrant festival atmosphere contrasting sharply with their disappointment.
FADE OUT.

continue the screenplay with the following scene in FDX: As they turn to leave, Kevin spots a group of teenagers sneaking in through a gap in the fence. He hesitates, weighing their options. Zion notices too and looks at Kevin with pleading eyes. Just as they are about to follow suit and repeat what they saw the teens doing, Kevin starts to go under the fence. Suddenly, security comes out of nowhere and begins beating and tazing the teenagers for sneaking in. Kevin, already halfway under the fence, quickly realizes the danger he's in. Thinking fast, he shouts at the teenagers, pretending that he was yelling at them for sneaking in. "Hey, you kids! You can't sneak in like that! It's not right!" he exclaims, trying to sound authoritative and angry. The security guards, momentarily confused, turn their attention to Kevin. They seem to buy his act, thinking that he was trying to stop the teenagers rather than sneak in himself. "Good looking out," one of the guards says to Kevin, giving him a nod of approval. "We'll take it from here."

EXT. ROLLING LOUD ENTRANCE - DAY
As Kevin and Zion turn to leave, their hearts heavy with disappointment, Kevin's eyes catch sight of a group of teenagers sneaking in through a gap in the fence. His desperation fuels a momentary hesitation, weighing their options. Zion notices his father's conflicted expression and looks at him with pleading eyes. A surge of determination flashes across Kevin's face.
KEVIN (whispering) Zion, follow my lead.
Just as they are about to follow suit and repeat what they saw the teens doing, Kevin's instincts kick in. He realizes the potential danger they could face if they proceed. Thinking fast, he raises his voice, pretending to admonish the teenagers.
KEVIN Hey, you kids! You can't sneak in like that! It's not right!
The security guards, who were engrossed in apprehending the teenagers, are momentarily taken aback by Kevin's outburst. They quickly divert their attention towards him, their eyes narrowing with suspicion.
SECURITY GUARD 1 What's going on here?
Kevin, trying to sound authoritative and angry, continues his act, pointing a finger towards the group of teenagers.
KEVIN I saw them trying to sneak in through the fence. It's not fair to everyone else who paid for their tickets!
The security guards, momentarily confused, exchange glances. They seem to buy Kevin's act, thinking that he was attempting to stop the teenagers rather than sneak in himself.
SECURITY GUARD 2 Good looking out. We'll take it from here.
The guards move swiftly, rushing towards the group of teenagers, who now find themselves at the center of attention. Kevin breathes a sigh of relief, grateful for the unexpected turn of events. He turns to Zion, a mix of relief and pride in his eyes.
KEVIN (smirking) Let's get out of here before they change their minds.
Zion, still processing the adrenaline-filled moment, nods eagerly. They turn away from the chaos and make their way back, leaving the festival behind.
FADE OUT.
