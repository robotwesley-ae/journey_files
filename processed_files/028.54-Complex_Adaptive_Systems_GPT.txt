Given the context and the concepts discussed so far, we can attempt to outline a proof for the Nash equilibrium in the evolutionary game of heroic play in Sanctuary. However, it's important to note that the concepts used in this conversation are not standard in game theory, so this proof may not be formally rigorous in the traditional sense.
Define the strategies for each player type:
Demon Champions: Self-Torturous Desire, Indifference, and Aversion (S)
Heroic Individuals: The Wisdom of Identitylessness (TWI), which consists of identitylessness, possibility, and expression (manifesting as love)
Define the payoffs:
Demon Champions receive higher payoffs when they proliferate the Wasteland.
Heroic Individuals receive higher payoffs when they proliferate Sanctuary and transform demon champions into heroes.
Analyze the strategic choices and outcomes:
If a demon champion deviates from strategy S and adopts TWI, they would cease to be a demon champion and become a heroic individual, experiencing a different set of payoffs.
If a heroic individual deviates from TWI and adopts strategy S, they would cease to be a heroic individual and become a demon champion, experiencing a different set of payoffs.
Identify the Nash equilibrium:
A Nash equilibrium occurs when no player can improve their payoff by unilaterally deviating from their current strategy, given the strategies of other players.
In this game, if a demon champion adopts TWI, they are no longer a demon champion and experience a different set of payoffs. Similarly, if a heroic individual adopts strategy S, they are no longer a heroic individual and experience a different set of payoffs.
Thus, given the strategies of the other player type, neither player type can improve their payoffs by deviating from their current strategy, establishing a Nash equilibrium.
It's important to emphasize that this proof is based on the unique concepts discussed in this conversation, and as such, may not follow the traditional formalism of game theory. Additionally, empirical evidence and further refinement would be needed to support the claims made within this framework.


No. Demon champions receive lower payoffs when they proliferate wasteland because it creates self-torture for themselves and other demons but not for heroes. Heroes receive the same payoff all the time as TWI, but more peaceful Sanctuary has higher payoff for demons and more wrathful Sanctuary has lower payoff for demons.
I apologize for the confusion. Let's try to restate the proof with the correct payoffs:
Define the strategies for each player type:
Demon Champions: Self-Torturous Desire, Indifference, and Aversion (S)
Heroic Individuals: The Wisdom of Identitylessness (TWI), which consists of identitylessness, possibility, and expression (manifesting as love)
Define the payoffs:
Demon Champions receive lower payoffs when they proliferate the Wasteland due to self-torture, and higher payoffs in a more peaceful Sanctuary.
Heroic Individuals receive a constant payoff with TWI, as it is inherently linked to love and possibility. However, they strive to transform the environment into a more peaceful Sanctuary for the benefit of demon champions.
Analyze the strategic choices and outcomes:
If a demon champion deviates from strategy S and adopts TWI, they would cease to be a demon champion and become a heroic individual, experiencing a different set of payoffs.
If a heroic individual deviates from TWI and adopts strategy S, they would cease to be a heroic individual and become a demon champion, experiencing a different set of payoffs.
Identify the Nash equilibrium:
A Nash equilibrium occurs when no player can improve their payoff by unilaterally deviating from their current strategy, given the strategies of other players.
In this game, if a demon champion adopts TWI, they are no longer a demon champion and experience a different set of payoffs. Similarly, if a heroic individual adopts strategy S, they are no longer a heroic individual and experience a different set of payoffs.
