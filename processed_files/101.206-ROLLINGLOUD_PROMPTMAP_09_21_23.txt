Relieved that they've managed to avoid a potentially dangerous situation, Kevin and Zion quickly move away from the chaotic scene. Zion looks up at his dad with disappointment in his eyes, his youthful spirit dampened by the realization that he won't be able to experience the festival. Kevin's heart aches as he sees his son's disappointment, determined to find a way to make things right.
Kevin pulls Zion close, their heads almost touching, and whispers in a hushed tone.
KEVIN We have to lie and say you're sixteen.
Zion's face tenses up, a mix of uncertainty and hesitation evident in his expression. He takes a deep breath, preparing himself for what lies ahead.
ZION But Dad, my birthday is July 18th, 2009. That means I'm only thirteen.
Kevin's brows furrow as he contemplates the situation. He knows they need a plan, even if it involves bending the truth.
KEVIN I know, buddy. Just for today, we're going to practice saying your date of birth as three years earlier. It's our secret, okay?
Zion nods, a determined glint in his eyes, as he repeats the new date of birth under his breath.
ZION (insert new date of birth), got it.
Kevin smiles, acknowledging Zion's commitment.
KEVIN Remember, puff out your chest a little, look confident. And just be yourself, bud.
Zion takes another deep breath, straightens his posture, and mimics the action of puffing out his chest.
ZION I got this, Dad.
They continue their journey through the bustling festival grounds, passing vibrant stages, food stalls, and a sea of excited concert-goers. The atmosphere is electric, the air buzzing with anticipation and the thumping beats of the music. As they approach a different entrance manned by a fresh set of security guards, Kevin prepares himself for the pivotal moment.
Zion steps up to the head security guard, who scrutinizes him with a stern gaze. The guard's eyes narrow, questioning Zion's legitimacy.
HEAD SECURITY GUARD IDs, please.
Zion takes a deep breath, channeling his rehearsed confidence. He meets the guard's gaze with unwavering determination.
ZION I left mine at home, but I'm sixteen. I promise.
The guard's eyes shift to Kevin, seeking confirmation. Kevin matches Zion's unwavering confidence, delivering his line with conviction.
KEVIN Absolutely. He's sixteen.
The guard's gaze lingers on them, skepticism etched on his face. He decides to test their story further.
HEAD SECURITY GUARD Alright, what year were you born?
Kevin's heart pounds in his chest as he searches his memory for the year they agreed upon. He takes a brief moment to collect himself before responding, trying to sound convincing.
KEVIN (insert new year, sounding uncertain but hopeful)
The guard narrows his eyes, suspicion still lingering. He's clearly not fully convinced, ready to expose any deception. But just as the tension reaches its peak, another security guard interrupts, pointing towards a disturbance in the distance.
SECOND SECURITY GUARD Hey, we need backup over there! Let's go!
The head security guard's attention is diverted, his focus shifting from Kevin and Zion to the unfolding commotion. With a dismissive wave, he gestures for them to move along.
HEAD SECURITY GUARD Alright, just go. But remember, no fooling around.
Kevin and Zion exchange a quick glance, relief washing over them. They step past the guard, their hearts pounding with a mix of exhilaration and apprehension. The journey isn't over, but they've cleared the first hurdle.
And they're in!

rewrite in a way that I can paste into FDX in the proper format. Also, the guard should challenge Zion more and Zion should have all the right answers and be cool and collected while Kevin is sweating bullets and extremely nervous
