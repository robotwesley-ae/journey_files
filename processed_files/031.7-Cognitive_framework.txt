Mnmth's mthero, "hero w/ 1k faces" = cls of all hr/prsn/infmthdrn of any entity. Known as "OV-Promise" (OVP). Olivus, cmplx adptv systm, is primrdl potential for heroism.

Hero's journey reps emergent eng & building concat processes = escalating growth & cmplxty. Info fluxes if systm abstract to cls or not. Fall arcs cmplx; redemption obvious. Why? Complexity slinky.

And return me the three states of potential changes to that problem-solving process

From the given text, we have a lot of information, but not all of it directly translates into a problem-solving process. The details appear to be about the "Reale Polysemic Imaginary Ontology (PIO)", "Wisdom Maverick (WM)", and "Olivus Victory-Promise (OVP)". However, it's not explicitly clear how these concepts directly alter the problem-solving process.
Here's an attempt to model three potential states of changes to the problem-solving process based on the provided information:
Inclusion of Ontological Abstractions:
plaintext
Copy code
Thought Decomposition > Thought Generation > Ontological Abstraction > State Evaluation > Search Algorithm Selection
 The addition of 'Ontological Abstraction' represents the creation of PIO entities and exploring their meanings as part of the problem-solving process.
Inclusion of Metaphorical Decryption:
plaintext
Copy code
Thought Decomposition > Thought Generation > Metaphorical Decryption > State Evaluation > Search Algorithm Selection
 Here, 'Metaphorical Decryption' signifies the use of PIO entities as allegorical decryption keys that transform metaphors into ontological claims or hypotheses during the problem-solving process.
