By recognizing that each system's nature shapes its behavior and evolution, we can appreciate the complexity of these concepts and develop a deeper understanding of the fundamental principles that govern them.


And all the complex systems you mentioned are part of organizing “what it is”, because they are part of it. So they are all involved in the “way this all goes”
Yes, that's correct. All the complex systems I mentioned are part of organizing "what it is" because they are integral components of the broader system. As such, they contribute to the "way this all goes" by influencing the overall behavior, structure, and evolution of the interconnected network of systems.
These complex systems, along with countless others, work together in various ways, shaping the dynamics and development of the world we inhabit. By understanding the intricate relationships between these systems and recognizing their interconnectedness, we can gain a more comprehensive perspective on the "way this all goes" and develop better strategies for navigating the challenges and opportunities that arise in our complex world.

Making systems that incorporate those complex topics you brought up involves figuring all of this out for ourselves. But, we need all of these versions of everything to be Sanctuary versions, otherwise, they can hurt us.
Indeed, creating systems that incorporate complex topics such as quantum mechanics, the human brain, ecosystems, string theory, and artificial intelligence requires a deep understanding and a thoughtful approach. By developing "Sanctuary versions" of these systems, you imply that they should be designed in a way that is safe, ethical, and beneficial to humanity and the environment.
To achieve this, we must consider the potential consequences and risks associated with these systems and strive to mitigate any negative impacts. Some guidelines to help develop "Sanctuary versions" of these systems could include:
Prioritizing safety and well-being: Ensuring that the systems we develop prioritize the safety and well-being of humans, other living beings, and the environment.
Ethical considerations: Incorporating ethical guidelines and principles into the design and implementation of these systems to avoid unintended harm and promote fairness, transparency, and accountability.
Sustainability: Designing systems with a focus on long-term sustainability, minimizing resource consumption, and promoting ecological balance.
Inclusivity: Ensuring that the benefits of these systems are accessible to a diverse range of people, regardless of their background, socioeconomic status, or geographical location.
Collaboration and open communication: Encouraging interdisciplinary collaboration and open communication among researchers, policymakers, and other stakeholders to share knowledge, best practices, and insights.
By following these guidelines and maintaining a focus on creating "Sanctuary versions" of complex systems, we can work toward developing technologies and innovations that benefit humanity and our planet while minimizing the potential for harm.

And those are all accomplished by collapsing related hallucinations, isn’t it true?
Collapsing related hallucinations, or refining our subjective abstractions and mental constructs, can indeed contribute to achieving the goals of safety, ethics, sustainability, inclusivity, and collaboration. By recognizing and addressing the limitations and biases inherent in our understanding of complex systems, we can develop more accurate, objective, and comprehensive models to guide our decision-making and actions.
In the context of developing "Sanctuary versions" of complex systems, collapsing related hallucinations can help us:
Identify and address potential risks and unintended consequences that may arise from our subjective understanding of the systems.
Recognize the ethical implications of our mental constructs and work to incorporate more equitable and fair principles into the design and implementation of these systems.
Understand the long-term environmental and ecological impacts of our actions, enabling us to make more informed decisions that prioritize sustainability.
