MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or similar databases for storing user stories, aspirations, and other platform data
IPFS or similar decentralized storage solutions for storing encrypted data and ensuring privacy
Blockchain and Smart Contracts:
Ethereum, Cardano, or another suitable blockchain platform for managing decentralized governance, voting, and secure data sharing
Solidity or another smart contract language for implementing custom logic and rules
Networking and Real-time Communication:
WebRTC or Socket.IO for enabling real-time communication between users
PubSub or similar messaging systems for scalable event-driven communication between components
Deployment and Infrastructure:
Docker for containerization and easier deployment
Kubernetes or similar orchestration tools for managing containerized services at scale
AWS, Google Cloud Platform, or another cloud provider for hosting the platform and leveraging their services (e.g., AI/ML, databases, etc.)
This proposed technology stack and architecture provide a flexible and scalable foundation for the Sanctuary Nexus platform. By using modern tools and technologies, the platform can accommodate the various layers and functionalities described earlier, ensuring a robust and secure environment for users to collaborate, share stories, and work towards their aspirations
