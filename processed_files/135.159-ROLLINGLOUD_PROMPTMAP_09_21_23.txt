Beam Dilemma: Understanding the gravity of Linda's situation, both Kevin and Chad carefully descend to join her on the beam, resolving to navigate it collectively. They proceed with caution, using the Ferris wheel's structure for balance.
A Rash Decision: In an adrenaline-driven moment, Chad spots what he believes to be a quicker way down and, against Kevin and Linda's protests, decides to take a daring shortcut. His bold attempt goes awry, and the last they see of Chad is his figure plummeting into the abyss below.
Spotting The Teddy Bear: While grappling with the shock of Chad's fall and their ongoing peril, Kevin spots a massive teddy bear in a pod a few levels beneath them. An audacious idea forms: might the plush toy act as a buffer, cushioning their descent? The immediate challenge is how to get to it.
The Beam Walk: The central beam of the Ferris wheel, albeit treacherous, appears to be the most direct route to the teddy bear's pod. With determination, Kevin suggests they persist in their journey along the beam. Taking the lead, he steps carefully, with Linda close behind, drawing strength from each other and the structure.
The Final Leap: Upon reaching the pod with the teddy bear, Kevin, after a brief negotiation and a promise of payment, procures the plush toy. With the teddy bear firmly in his grasp, he braces himself. Taking a deep, resolute breath, Kevin makes the courageous jump from the Ferris wheel, using the stuffed toy to soften his landing.

I've retained the tension and narrative continuity while making the changes you requested.
Great! Now I'd love to add some surprise and shock value into this sequence by having Linda also fall at some point (should be before Chad) to her supposed death (she will show up at the end of the scene) and at some point in the sequence, Chad (like you have it) falls to his supposed death (of course he's fine and will find Kevin at the end of the scene) leaving Kevin alone to do the Teddy Bear stunt on his own

Absolutely, let's incorporate those elements for added suspense. Here's a modified sequence:

Stranded Situation: Kevin, Chad, and Linda are trapped in a pod at the very top of a Ferris wheel during the Rolling Loud Festival. As time stretches with no sign of rescue, the situation becomes dire.
Initial Assessment: Linda, using her keen observational skills, spots a neighboring pod slightly below their position. Chad, with memories of his past climbing adventures, believes they could jump to this pod to initiate their descent. Kevin, wary of the looming dangers, is hesitant but acknowledges the urgency of their predicament.
Linda's Unfortunate Leap: Having weighed their options, Chad decides to go first. He carefully positions himself, then leaps to the next pod, landing safely. He signals for the others to follow. As Linda jumps, a gust of wind throws her off balance. She scrambles desperately to grasp something, but to the utter shock of her companions, she plunges into the darkness below. Both Kevin and Chad are paralyzed for a moment, grappling with the horror of what just happened.
The Beam Dilemma: Chad, trying to pull himself together after Linda's terrifying fall, suggests they continue their perilous journey along the beam of the Ferris wheel. Kevin, still in shock but realizing he has no other option, agrees. The two cautiously start their descent, supporting each other and using the Ferris wheel's structure for balance.
Chad's Impulsive Decision: As they navigate the beam, Chad suddenly spots what he believes is a faster route down. Ignoring Kevin's warnings, he makes a hasty, audacious move. It backfires dramatically. Kevin watches in horror as Chad, too, disappears into the void, leaving him utterly alone high above the festival grounds.
Spotting The Teddy Bear: Desolate and terrified, Kevin forces himself to look around, searching for any possible way out. He spots a giant teddy bear in a pod a few levels below. An audacious idea sparks: could this plush
