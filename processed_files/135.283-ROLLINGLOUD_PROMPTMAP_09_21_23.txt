 saved just in time.
Success: They reach the ground safely, exhilarated by their adventure.
Now, we can expand on these key beats and flesh out the scene.

Let's work through the key beats like it's own little story. Some notes: They don't have to all be together the whole time. They can each try to do their own move. I like the idea of the TEDDY BEAR the last beat of the scene.

Certainly, let's work through the key beats one by one, focusing on the adventure of Kevin, Chad, and Linda trying to get down from the top of the Ferris wheel in an intoxicated state.
Introduction:
Kevin, Chad, and Linda find themselves stranded at the top of the Ferris wheel at Rolling Loud Festival.
They realize they need to get down safely.
The height and their intoxicated state add to the tension.
Problem-Solving:
Kevin suggests they use a giant stuffed animal as padding for their descent.
The idea is met with giggles and agreement.
They start looking for a suitable pod with a stuffed animal.
The Leap:
Chad decides to go first, leaping onto a neighboring pod.
He encounters an eccentric festival-goer dressed as a disco ball who's dancing to the music.
Chad joins in briefly before leaping to another pod.
Linda goes next and encounters a festival-goer with a hula hoop, joining in on the fun.
Kevin makes the final jump, landing on a pod that has a group of festival-goers playing an impromptu game of cards.
Close Call:
As Linda attempts to jump to the next pod, she slips and dangles precariously from the edge.
Panic ensues as Kevin and Chad reach out to grab her.
Just as it seems she might fall, they manage to pull her up and onto the pod.
They share a relieved but intoxicated laugh before moving on.
Success:
After a series of jumps and encounters with eccentric festival-goers, they reach a pod with a giant stuffed teddy bear.
Kevin suggests they use it as padding for their final leap to the ground.
With the teddy bear in tow, they make the daring jump, feeling a rush of adrenaline.
They land safely on the ground to the cheers and applause of festival-goers who witnessed their adventurous descent.
Conclusion:
The trio, still slightly high and exhilarated, hugs the giant teddy bear in triumph.
They exchange stories and laughs about their adventure as they continue to enjoy the festival.
This sequence combines adventure, humor, and the chaotic atmosphere of the Rolling Loud Festival, with each character having their moment of daring and fun.
