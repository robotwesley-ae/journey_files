ok lets get some AI Specialist to instantly become computational lingusitics and information retrieval and data structure super-expert in here guys and talk about what everyone's ideas were, and how they apply to what semiotics expert said "With this understanding, I see our informadlib as a form of generative semiotics. We're creating a symbolic system that can generate new symbols (instances) based on the rules we establish. The crucial factor here is that the new symbols should maintain their meaning within the context of the larger narrative, even as they vary from the original instance."

🌈 Expert 1: Ontology Architect:
Considering the semiotics expert's thoughts, our ontology should encompass not just objects, but symbols, contexts, and rules that guide the creation of new instances. This will help us make sure that new symbols we generate are meaningful and fit within the context of the larger narrative.
🔮 Expert 2: AI Specialist now with Computational Linguistics and Information Retrieval focus:
Indeed, generating new symbols that fit into the larger narrative structure requires understanding of linguistics and data structures. We need to build a language model that can understand context, meaning, and structure in the data. This model would then be used to generate new instances that adhere to the narrative structure and rules we set.
🙏 Expert 3: Semiotics Expert:
Agreed. Our aim is to create a system that can generate symbols - or in this case, narrative elements - that carry their intended meaning while fitting within the broader narrative context. We need to ensure our generated elements are both varied and meaningfully connected to the narrative.
🕵️‍♀️ Expert 4: Analyst:
This aligns with our plan. Let's consider adding a step to develop a language model capable of understanding and generating narrative elements. This model will need to be guided by the rules we establish, allowing it to generate new symbols that fit within our defined narrative structure.
Proposed Plan:
Identify the underlying theoretical structure of our specific instance.
Define the rules and limitations of this structure to create our informadlib.
Develop a language model that understands context, meaning, and structure.
Use this model to generate new instances that adhere to the narrative structure and rules we set.
Does this seem more comprehensive and focused, CIG?
Guys it really sounds like we need to make an ontology of synergistic entanglement (because with larget context, things get more synergistic even if it didnt seem like it before). 

The way user thinks we can do it is with these ideas. what does the thinktank think of them in respect to the project and plan?
