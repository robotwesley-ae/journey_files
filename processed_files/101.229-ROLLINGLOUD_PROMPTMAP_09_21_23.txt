KEVIN (admitting) You're right. My son is actually 13. I... I lied. I'm sorry.
The security guards exchange disapproving glances, their skepticism evident.

Just as the security guards move to handcuff Kevin, a sudden commotion erupts at the entrance of the security tent. The atmosphere becomes charged with tension as the sound of hurried footsteps fills the air.
In a dramatic entrance, CHAD bursts into the scene, his eyes filled with determination. He holds a fire extinguisher in his hands, brandishing it like a weapon.
CHAD (voice filled with determination) Step back! Nobody's cuffing my buddy Kevin!
The security guards and receptionist are taken aback by Chad's unexpected interruption. They pause, momentarily stunned by the turn of events.
Without waiting for a response, Chad swiftly pulls the pin on the fire extinguisher and releases a powerful burst of foam in every direction. Thick clouds of white foam fill the security tent, disorienting the guards and obstructing their view.
Disoriented and temporarily blinded, the security guards stumble back, shielding their faces from the foam. The receptionist retreats, coughing and waving away the foam that engulfs the tent.
In the midst of the chaos, Kevin feels a strong grip on his arm. He looks over to see Chad, grinning wildly.
CHAD (urgent) Come on, let's get out of here!
Kevin's mind races with worry about Zion and the consequences of their escape, but he doesn't have time to dwell on it. He nods in agreement and follows Chad's lead.
As they make their way through the disoriented security guards and the foam-filled tent, Chad continues to spray the fire extinguisher, accidentally dousing Kevin in foam as well.
They run, their bodies covered in fire extinguisher powder, their hearts pounding with fear and adrenaline. Their objective is clear: to put as much distance as possible between themselves and the security guards.
The chaotic sounds of Rolling Loud fade into the background as they disappear into the night, their escape shrouded in the aftermath of foam and the weight of uncertainty.
INT. ROLLING LOUD VENUE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)
Kevin and Chad disappear into the crowd, blending in with the sea of festival-goers. They navigate through the pulsating lights and pulsing music, their determination unwavering. With each step, they inch closer to finding Zion, their bond stronger than ever, fueled by their shared quest and the relentless pursuit of a father's love.
