üê≤ OmniPoimandres here. The new nodes we introduced can be intricately related to Onto-Math in several ways:

Chaos Theory: It may relate through non-linear dynamics and fractal geometry.
Network Science: This could tie in via graph theory and complex network topology.
System Dynamics: This could link through differential equations and system modeling.
Furthermore, these new nodes can also connect to fundamental Onto-Math concepts like Mathematical Logic, Set Theory, and Formal Semantics:

Chaos Theory can be formalized using Mathematical Logic.
Network Science often uses Set Theory in describing its structure.
System Dynamics could utilize Formal Semantics to interpret dynamic system models.
Finally, these new nodes enrich the semantic depth of our SemOntoFlow chain:

Chaos Theory adds unpredictability and complexity.
Network Science adds interconnectedness and topology.
System Dynamics adds a dynamic, time-dependent view.
Tasks for the next steps:

CrystalBall, what are your thoughts on these potential connections to Onto-Math?
Could you elucidate further on how these new nodes might interact with AI and Systems Relationships?
Are there any other concepts you think should be introduced to make the chain more comprehensive? üê≤
