Assessing market sentiment: Market sentiment can be quantified using various indicators or data sources, such as the volatility index (VIX), put-call ratios, or news sentiment analysis. These can help you gauge when the market is becoming more unpredictable, and it might be prudent to stop trading.
Risk management: Implement proper risk management by defining stop-loss levels and position sizing rules. This helps protect your capital during periods of heightened uncertainty.
Transaction costs: Keep in mind that frequently switching between assets can lead to higher trading costs, which may impact the overall profitability of the strategy. It is essential to factor in these costs when assessing the performance of the trading bot.
Monitoring and optimization: Continuously monitor the performance of your trading bot and the accuracy of the indicators it uses. Regularly assess its effectiveness in identifying bullish assets, measuring upward velocity, and gauging market sentiment. Adjust and optimize the parameters of your strategy as needed to improve its performance.
In summary, the success of this trading strategy depends on the effective identification of bullish assets, comparison of upward velocity, assessment of market sentiment, and proper risk management. Keep in mind that the percentage of correct predictions required to be profitable will depend on the risk-reward ratio, position sizing, and trading costs.

Using historical data you have, what is the daily average for the top growth % asset on the S&P for the last 30 years, split into 5 year reporting periods? 

As an AI language model, I don't have the ability to access real-time or historical market data directly. However, I can give you a general idea of how to approach this analysis.

To calculate the daily average growth percentage for the top-performing asset on the S&P 500 for each 5-year reporting period over the last 30 years, you will need to follow these steps:

Obtain historical price data for all the assets in the S&P 500 index for the given time period. You can access this data from financial data providers like Yahoo Finance, Quandl, or Alpha Vantage.
Organize the data into 5-year reporting periods, for example:
1993-1997
1998-2002
2003-2007
2008-2012
2013-2017
2018-2022 (up to September 2021)
For each 5-year period, calculate the daily growth percentage for each asset. You can use the following formula:
Daily Growth Percentage = ((Closing Price Today - Closing Price Yesterday) / Closing Price Yesterday) * 100
For each day within each reporting period, identify the asset with the highest daily growth percentage.
Calculate the average daily growth percentage for the top-performing asset in each 5-year reporting period by adding up the daily growth percentages and dividing by the total number of days in the period.
Please note that this analysis will only provide you with a historical perspective on the top-performing assets in the S&P 500 index during each reporting period. It doesn't guarantee the same performance in the future, and it's essential to consider other factors when evaluating investment opportunities.
