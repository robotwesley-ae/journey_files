That can be used for communicating Sanctuary, which purifies Wasteland, or communicating Wasteland, which is toxic and pollutes Sanctuary. 
The Sanctuaries and Wastelands of our own mind, which we aggregate there, create real world effects and are all interconnected. My interconnectedness with the "being cool" sanctuary devolved into a wasteland. In the "being cool" wasteland, i realized the existence of sanctuaries and wastelands, and how they change from being one to another, but there is a continual fractal growing towards Sanctuary and away from Wastelands. All wastelands perpetuated by me can pollute others. All Sanctuaries perpetuated by me can purify others. It also means I can give this monster to other people, or I can fight it before they encounter it, and through doing so, at the very least, I will become an example for anyone who encounters it.

It is equally scientific to say they died from cigarette monster attack. The only barrier is whether or not we actually formally call cigarette induced lung cancer "the cigarette monster". 

It is **not relevant**. The cigarette monster **exists** by way of being a mapped allegory, and not just a metaphor.
You've presented a multi-layered and provocative thought experiment that weaves together concepts of emergence, compression patterns, the shoe 'monster', and the potential for individual actions to shift the balance between sanctuary and wasteland. Let's unpack this step by step:

Hypothesis: Duality Collapse & Emergence

Central Idea:  Dualities conceal an underlying non-dual reality. By decomposing dualistic surface patterns into their primitive components, a new emergent property arises: the understanding that the duality was an illusion.

The 'Throws' Example: Decomposing the action of "throws" into its fundamental elements (human, object, forces, intention) momentarily erases the idea of "throws" and replaces it with a complex raw data chain of events. From this, we re-conceptualize "throws" as an emergent shorthand for encapsulating that process.

Sanctuary Implication:  The act of collapsing a duality reveals a deeper interconnected structure that lies within the Sanctuary framework.

The 'Shoe Monster' Thought Experiment

Narrative Layers: It starts with a vivid image of a psychedelic-induced shoe monster, then shifts to the physical and psychological cost of wearing harmful shoes, finally connecting to a broader search for meaning and the masks we wear.

Duality as Illusion: The shoes function as a symbol of a duality between the desired self-image ('cool') and hidden insecurities, leading to harmful choices (bad shoes). The 'monster' is the embodiment of that destructive duality.

Sanctuary/Wasteland: Initially, the attachment to 'coolness' is a self-created wasteland.  The realization and analysis of this duality sparks the shift towards sanctuary.

Real-World Consequences

Interconnectivity: You emphasize that our inner sanctuaries and wastelands influence the external world.  Choosing harmful actions due to personal wastelands can spread that harm outward.

Agency:  But the reverse is also true. Deliberately tending to inner sanctuaries can have a positive ripple effect, purifying wastelands in ourselves and potentially in others.

Cigarette Monster Allegory: While whimsical, it serves its purpose. If we accept that a lack of understanding leads to 'shoe monsters' with tangible consequences, we are forced to acknowledge the dangers of less obvious dualities, where cause and effect chains are harder to see.

Key Takeaways

Allegory as Map: The 'monster' might be a metaphor, but you argue that the chain of negative consequences it represents is very real, and thus the allegory serves as a mappable structure onto reality.

Personal as Universal:  The quest to dismantle inner wastelands isn't simply for self-improvement but has real-world, even ethical, consequences due to the interconnectedness you posit.

Let's Explore Further

Formalizing the Process:  How can we turn the duality collapse method into a tool? Could it be a step-by-step process to apply to other harmful dualities (self-sabotage patterns, societal biases, etc.)?
