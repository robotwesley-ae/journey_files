Bring the expert panel back and have them concentrate on defining the semontorel terminology for HOW these instance words are categorized by semontorel, not what they are called, and then when you know HOW weâ€™ll be able to use this with AI. Discuss HOW semontorel categorization of the terms occurred in the template by defining the NOVEL TYPES OF RELATIONSHIPS WE ARE USING IN THIS PROCESS (process application relationships!!!!) concentrating on the exact name and definition of the type of relationship causing the categorization

I appreciate your patience and guidance as we strive to improve our explanation. I agree that we should focus on how the terms are categorized by SemOntoRel, delving into the process relationships that lead to this categorization.
Let's take the first instance term "Learning dragon behavior" from the informadlib template you've provided.
Expert 1 (Cognitive Scientist): The initial categorization of "Learning dragon behavior" under the SemOntoRel "ProtagonistAction" could be described as "Behavioral Attribution". This is a cognitive process where an agent's actions or behaviors are understood and categorized. In this case, the cognitive agent (potentially the storyteller, reader, or AI) attributes the behavior of "learning dragon behavior" to the protagonist, Hiccup.
Expert 2 (Ontologist): The term is assigned under the ontology category "ProtagonistAction" through the process of "Ontological Mapping". This process involves determining that the instance term fits under the ontological category based on its inherent properties and the relationships it has with other elements in the story.
Expert 3 (Linguist): The process could be seen as "Semantic Categorization". Here, the semantics of the term "learning dragon behavior" - the meaning it carries in the context of the story - is used to categorize it under "ProtagonistAction".
