 are released from jail, ready to continue their search for Zion.

Okay, there has to be something in jail that gives them the whereabouts of Zion and something that gives them hope for a big third act showdown

As Kevin and Chad sit in their cell, feeling hopeless, they hear a commotion outside. They press their ears to the door and hear a group of festival-goers talking loudly about a secret rave happening in an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of the festival grounds. One of them mentions seeing a group of teens, including Zion, heading in that direction earlier.
Kevin and Chad exchange a look, feeling a glimmer of hope. But they know they have to get out of jail to make it to the rave in time. They start brainstorming a plan, but before they can come up with anything, a wild-looking festival-goer stumbles into their cell.
The festival-goer introduces himself as "Mushroom Mike" and offers to help them escape. He tells them he knows a secret way out of the jail, but they have to be willing to do something for him in return. He produces a bag of psychedelic mushrooms and asks if they're willing to take a trip with him to the rave.
Kevin and Chad are hesitant at first, but they know they need to get out of jail and find Zion. They agree to take the mushrooms and follow Mushroom Mike as he leads them through a secret tunnel that leads out of the jail.
As they stumble out of the tunnel and into the night air, the effects of the mushrooms start to take hold. The world around them becomes a blur of colors and sounds, and they feel a sense of euphoria wash over them. They follow Mushroom Mike through the festival grounds, dodging security guards and dancing their way through crowds of partygoers.
As they reach the outskirts of the festival grounds, they see a flickering light in the distance. It's the abandoned warehouse, and they know they're close to finding Zion. With a renewed sense of purpose, they run towards the warehouse, ready for whatever lies ahead.

I love mushroom mike, but don't love the abandoned rave. I like the finally happening on the big stage.

Here's a possible rewrite with that adjustment:
In jail, Kevin and Chad meet a friendly but eccentric inmate named Mushroom Mike. Mike tells them he overheard a group of festival-goers talking about a secret after-party being held at the main stage after the festival ends. They also mention that a group of people were talking about a young kid wandering around backstage looking lost.
With this new lead, Kevin and Chad start to see a glimmer of hope. They hatch a plan to escape from jail and make their way to the main stage to look for Zion. With Mushroom Mike's help, they manage to slip out of their cell undetected.
As they make their way towards the main stage, they encounter a series of obstacles, including dodging security guards and avoiding being caught by festival staff. But as they finally approach the stage, they spot Zion in the crowd, watching the headlining act.
Kevin and Chad make their way to the front of the stage, determined to reunite with Zion. But as they try to push their way through the crowd, they attract the attention of the headlining artist, who mistakes them for overzealous fans trying to get on stage.
Before they know it, Kevin and Chad are being escorted backstage, where they come face to face with the headliner. In a moment of desperation, Kevin blurts out the truth about their situation and asks for the headliner's help in finding Zion.
To their surprise, the headliner turns out to be a kind and empathetic person, who agrees to help them. Together, they scour the backstage area, searching for any sign of Zion.
Finally, they spot him, sitting alone in a quiet corner. As Kevin and Chad rush to embrace him, they realize the true meaning of family and the importance of being there for each other no matter what.

rewrite the following, but instead of the secret rave, it should be the grand finally on the main stage: As
