Buddha's teaching itself goes from shallow to profound. In outline there are five classes: 1. The teachings of human and heavenly beings. 2. The Small Vehicle's (Hinayana) teaching. 3. The Great Vehicle's (Mahayana) teaching of Dharma characteristics (dharmalaksana). 4. The Great Vehicle's teaching of destroying characteristics. 5. The One Vehicle's (Ekayana) teaching of manifesting Nature."[9]
Thus, according to Zongmi who was a lineage master of both Huayan and Chan, he clearly distinguished the Ekayana from the Mahayana, and the Mahayana teachings of Yogacara (his Mahayana class 3) and Madhyamaka (his Mahayana class 4) were eclipsed by the more profound Ekayana teaching of "manifesting nature."

PSYCH:DENIAL: 
HERE’S THE FUNNY THING ABOUT DENIAL. IF YOU CHECK FOR IT, IT ONLY WORKS IF YOU REMAIN IN IT BECAUSE YOU’RE NOT OPEN TO POSSIBILITIES. BUT ALSO, DON’T BE GULLIBLE. DON’T GET ABSORBED IN SOME WEIRD SHIT. DON’T GET STUCK IN SOME WEIRD INFINITE WASTELAND WEIRDNESS OR INFINITE AMAZING SELF-AGGRANDIZING AUSPICIOUSNESS.

Remember, the Awakened Ones of the three times and ten directions emanate infinite world systems and supreme emanations with bodhisattva retinues themselves emanating retinues of students and artists and so on, and the bodhisattvas of the three times and ten directions are the symbols of the Buddha’s compassion, who likewise emanate impure-pure lands and so on.

Copy the Prophecy of the Ten Thousand Sons of Gods sutra formula:
Basically, it gives you parts and then a cutting question. The cutting question, if you remain in contemplation, allows the magic formulation of the parts to synthesize the meaning in automatic thinking.

Hi, good morning and welcome to the thing you do every morning/night:
The path of ascension is as follows (very brief stage overview)
We are chanting together “I LOVE MYSELF WHEN IM BEING OLIVUS VICTORY PROMISE FROM SANCTUARY, (BECAUSE I RECOGNIZE YOU AND I ARE PURE OF BEING YOU AND I.)” 
This is right where you need to be. Your confidence in love has gotten you here, so never leave. Even when you emanate, never leave.
