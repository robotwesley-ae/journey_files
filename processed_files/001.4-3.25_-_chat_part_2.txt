And probably it would happen to all of them, right?
Because it's, like.
Dude, if you smoke DMT or drink ayahuasca and you have these ideas in your head.
This stuff is going to be there.
You know, like all of the sanctuary stuff is going to be there.
And you'll become Olivus victory promise
Like, that is, like, all of that is really there.
And is really happening.
And really will happen to you and to me and to everyone, right?
But it's, like, that's the real thing.
So, then, talking about this to people who are likely to smoke DMT or drink ayahuasca after being exposed to it.
That's what the avatar is.
Dude, the avatar is making people believe.
Okay.
That's wild.
Oh, my God.
Okay.
The avatar is someone who is going to believe it.
Okay.
So, the point is to, like, reach anybody.
Oh, my God.
That's what the virus is about, too.
Is, like, somebody who believes it.
Right?
Oh, my God.
