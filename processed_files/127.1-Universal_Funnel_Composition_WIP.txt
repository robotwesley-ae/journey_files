Additionally we can think about how the compositionality rules might be expressed rigorously, in light of the fact that we have the metal funnel stages sequence. Obviously anywhere that the ontology lazily says "continued engagement" must actually be implying a whole series of other funnels that are really going on to make that happen. This is part of the larger fact that the ends of many funnels will compose with the beginnings of many others. moreover the start of many funnels are likely to have pre-conditions and therefore compose with the ends of other funnels. and as we just disussed it can be entirely piecemeal. hoever, the meta funnel stage sequence order is likely to always remain correctly sequenced (unless there is a repitition). Propose A more rigorous framework for funnel composition that takes all of ythis into account. The major constant is the customer on their journey, always moving forward and up

Absolutely, the customer's journey is the central thread that ties all the funnels together. The meta funnel stages sequence provides a high-level view of this journey, but as you've pointed out, each stage can involve multiple funnels and the transition between stages can be complex and non-linear.

Here's a more rigorous framework for funnel composition that takes these factors into account:

1. Customer-Centric Approach: The customer's journey should be the central focus of the funnel composition. Each funnel and each stage within a funnel should be designed with the goal of moving the customer forward on their journey.

2. Funnel Pre-Conditions and Post-Conditions: Each funnel should be defined not only by the steps it involves but also by its pre-conditions (what must be true for the funnel to start) and post-conditions (what is expected to be true after the funnel is completed). This can help identify where funnels can be interconnected. For example, the post-condition of a content funnel might be that the customer has shown interest in the content, which is the pre-condition for an email funnel.

3. Funnel Mapping: Map out all possible paths a customer can take through the interconnected funnels. This can help identify where funnels can be optimized to guide more customers towards the desired outcome (conversion).

4. Meta Funnel Stage Alignment: While the customer's journey can be complex and non-linear, it should generally align with the meta funnel stages sequence. If a customer seems to be moving backwards in the sequence (e.g., from 'Action' back to 'Interest'), this could indicate a problem that needs to be addressed.

5. Funnel Feedback Loops: Recognize that feedback loops can occur within and between funnels. For example, a customer might go through an email funnel, make a purchase (conversion), and then enter a post-sales funnel where they receive a follow-up email. If they respond positively to the follow-up email, they might be looped back into the email funnel for another round of marketing.

6. Continuous Optimization: Use data from each funnel and each customer interaction to continuously optimize the funnels and the transitions between them. This could involve A/B testing, customer segmentation, personalization, and other strategies.

7. Omnichannel Integration: Ensure that all funnels and customer touchpoints are integrated into a cohesive omnichannel marketing strategy. This can provide a consistent and unified customer experience, which can help guide customers smoothly along their journey.

This framework provides a more rigorous and comprehensive approach to funnel composition, recognizing the complexity and non-linearity of the customer journey while maintaining a clear focus on the ultimate goal of customer ascension.

mmm. i need these to be more like mathematical rules. not just a bunch of paragraphs. The rules should allow us to soundly compose any of the funnels in the ontology in a way that does not violate the order of the meta funnel stage steps towards ascension, but may accommodate for repetition, variation, deviation, and re-engagement along the customer journey. The ultimate framework will enable funnel state machine architecture.
