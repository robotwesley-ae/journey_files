LINDA (resolute) Alright, do you have rubber gloves? CHAD What? Why would I have rubber gloves? LINDA I don’t know. For good luck? CHAD What are you talking about? LINDA Forget the gloves.

The hunt for Zion is on.

INT. FESTIVAL JAIL - NIGHT

Chad winces, a glow stick lodged uncomfortably inside him. Linda strokes his hair gently, trying to offer comfort despite their dire situation.

LINDA
(pleading)
Medic!? We need a medic here!

CHAD
(agitated)
How can you leave us in here like this? A glow stick up the ass isn't exactly a laughing matter!

LINDA
(indignant)
This has to violate some human rights convention!

Despite their cries, no help arrives. 

LINDA
(resolute)
Do you have rubber gloves, Chad?

CHAD
(puzzled)
Why on earth would I carry rubber gloves?

LINDA
(exasperated)
Never mind. Just... just bend over.

CHAD
(startled)
What?!

LINDA
(calming)
Trust me. I'm a trained first aider.

Chad looks at Linda, uncertainty written all over his face. 

CUT TO:

INT. PLAYBUS - CONTINUOUS

Playboi Carti looks at Kevin, his eyes softening.

PLAYBOI CARTI
(earnest)
You know, Kev... I respect that. Your dedication for your son. Makes me wish I had a father like you.

KEVIN
(desperate)
Thanks, Carti. But I've put him in danger. Child services could take him away, my friends are in jail, festival security is after me, and I might lose my job--

Carti motions for his BURLY BODYGUARD to come over.

PLAYBOI CARTI
(to Burly Bodyguard)
Yo, Ty. Help Kevin out, will ya?

INT. FESTIVAL JAIL - CONTINUOUS

Chad yelps as Linda tries to remove the glow stick. His cries are a mix of pain and...pleasure?

CHAD
(confused)
Ow! But...also...

Suddenly, SECURITY GUARD 1 appears, followed by Kevin, Shenseea, Keeshaloo, and Ty (the Burly Bodyguard).

SECURITY GUARD 1
(astonished)
What the hell is going on here?

Then, the glow stick breaks with a SNAP, spraying luminescent goo onto Linda's face.

CHAD
(panicked)
What just happened?!

LINDA
(resigned)
We're going to need professional medical help. Now.

SECURITY GUARD 1
(exhales)
Great. Just great.
