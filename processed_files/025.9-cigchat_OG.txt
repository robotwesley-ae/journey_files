 realist, I would suggest focusing primarily on the practicalities of this task. Rather than getting lost in the minutiae of Hiccup's character or the specifics of the story, concentrate on identifying the key elements that drive the narrative forward and prompt character growth. Then, focus on how these elements can be adapted or applied to different narratives or characters, keeping in mind the unique context of each.

Expert 1: Detail-Oriented Architect + Pragmatic Realist
With the insights from the pragmatic realist, I agree we need to distill down the detailed map into essential components. To do this, we can differentiate primary and secondary plot points, isolate fundamental character attributes, and prioritize crucial growth stages. This way, we combine exhaustive mapping with practical focus.
Expert 2: Top-Down Visionary + Detail-Oriented Architect
Aligning with the detail-oriented architect's approach, once we have our high-level roadmap based on archetypes and universal themes, we can start to layer in some of the specifics from our detailed story map. This way, we are ensuring that our broad structures are still grounded in specific, tangible narrative elements.
Expert 3: Pragmatic Realist + Top-Down Visionary
Using the visionary's universal themes as a starting point, we can then identify practical narrative elements that support these themes. This combined approach ensures we are targeting tangible narrative devices while still adhering to broader, universal themes.
üåê Superanalyst's holistic knitting analysis:
Our approach needs to balance detail and universality while maintaining practical application. Begin with identifying universal themes and narrative archetypes (Top-Down Visionary), then move to detail mapping of the specific story (Detail-Oriented Architect), and finally distill these into practical narrative elements (Pragmatic Realist). In this way, we achieve a multi-layered, comprehensive, yet pragmatic narrative structure that can be applied to various contexts and characters.
ok but it's not that deep. it isn't necessary to model everything. we just need to know the exact key words for the search and their order. let's use the same method, with new experts, who are experts in cryptography, linguistics, semiotics, ontology, AI, etc. in order to think about this. we really need to be thinking of this as an ORACLE situation, where we have a literal crystal ball that can show us informatihedrons if we define them correctly. Let's think about the informadlib and what that means as a template and how ontol-ultramax-sub-contextualization can be leveraged to accomplish this instantaneously and how we might think about making an index of terms in order to start mapping the oracle search capacity

In cryptography, the key is to transform data in a way that only someone who possesses a specific piece of knowledge can interpret it. For our purpose, we might consider viewing the informadlib as a form of 'cipher' - it's a template that can be filled with a multitude of different 'inputs' to yield different outputs. The trick is determining what those inputs should be. We could look to categorize different aspects of the information we're dealing with (characters, settings, themes, etc.), and assign them unique codes or 'keys'. Then, by ordering these keys in a specific way, we could quickly and accurately search for the precise informadlib we're looking for.
Expert 2: Linguistics Specialist
From a linguistics perspective, understanding the structure and semantics of language is paramount. We could try to define a 'grammar' for our informadlib, where different parts of the template correspond to different parts of a sentence (subject, verb, object, etc.). This could provide a structural foundation for creating more complex and specific queries. Also, by focusing on semantics, we could ensure that the terms we're using in our informadlib are as accurate and meaningful as possible.
