Data ownership: When a user discovers a novel node in the knowledge graph, they can claim ownership of it by encrypting the node with their unique encryption key. This ensures that only the user (or someone with the correct decryption key) can access the information associated with that node.
Access control: If a user wants to access a node owned by another user, they can request access by paying a fee or obtaining permission from the owner. The owner can then share the decryption key or perform the necessary computations on the encrypted data (using homomorphic encryption) and share the result with the requester, without exposing the original data.
Implementing these features using homomorphic encryption could strengthen the privacy and security of the Crystal Ball system while enabling a more collaborative and dynamic knowledge-sharing environment. However, it's essential to consider the added computational complexity and overhead that comes with homomorphic encryption, and balance it with the system's performance and usability requirements.


we can also implement an intent limiter that ontologically classifies the possible uses of information and the likelihood of negative outcomes and hides it from people who dont have certain permissions or even destroys it
Indeed, implementing an intent limiter in the Crystal Ball system can help to minimize potential misuse of information and ensure that sensitive data is only accessible to authorized users. To achieve this, you can follow these steps:
Intent classification: Develop a module that can classify the possible uses of information based on user input or context. This can be done using machine learning algorithms, such as classifiers or natural language understanding models, to identify and categorize intents.
Outcome prediction: For each identified intent, estimate the likelihood of negative outcomes. This can involve modeling the relationships between intents, actions, and outcomes, and quantifying the risk associated with each intent. You might use techniques like Bayesian networks, decision trees, or reinforcement learning to model and predict these relationships.
Access control: Based on the intent classification and outcome prediction, define access control rules and permissions for each user or group of users. For example, users with a high risk of causing negative outcomes may have limited access to sensitive information, while trusted users may have broader access.
Dynamic permission management: Regularly update and re-evaluate users' permissions based on their behavior, contributions, and the evolving state of the knowledge graph. This can help to maintain an accurate and up-to-date understanding of users' intent and potential impact on the system.
Information hiding or destruction: In cases where the potential for negative outcomes is deemed too high, you may choose to hide the information from unauthorized users or even destroy it. However, it is crucial to consider the ethical implications of such actions and ensure that they align with established guidelines and regulations.
Implementing an intent limiter in the Crystal Ball system can help to maintain a secure and responsible environment for knowledge sharing, but it's important to balance these security measures with the need for transparency, collaboration, and innovation.


Ok this doesnt matter though. We need to build this system. Please design the technology stack for the Crystal Ball system, indicating everywhere that we need to discover new knowledge (such as in order to create the polysemic encryption algorithm), while attempting to fill in all of the potential gaps such that the system design is complete.
To design the technology stack for the Crystal Ball system, we can build on existing technologies and frameworks while identifying areas where new knowledge or techniques are needed. Here's a high-level overview of the technology stack:
