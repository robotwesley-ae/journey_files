Creating a Safe Environment: Both the Sanctuary coach in emergent flow coaching and the tantric guru in a feast are responsible for creating a safe, supportive, and non-judgmental environment where participants can explore their inner selves, confront their fears, and experience growth.
Facilitating Transformation: The tantric guru in a feast aims to lead participants through practices and rituals that transform their consciousness and help them transcend ordinary experiences, while the Sanctuary coach in emergent flow coaching helps individuals navigate the emergent flow, guiding them through the process of self-discovery and personal growth.
Empowering Participants: Both roles involve empowering individuals to take charge of their own lives and experiences. In a feast, a tantric guru helps participants harness their own energy and power, while a Sanctuary coach encourages individuals to tap into their innate wisdom and resources to create positive change in their lives.
Offering Wisdom and Guidance: Both the tantric guru and the Sanctuary coach provide wisdom and guidance based on their own experiences and knowledge. They draw upon their understanding of their respective systems to offer insights, advice, and support to those they guide.
Navigating Challenges: In both settings, the role of the guide is to help participants navigate the challenges and obstacles they encounter on their journey. The tantric guru helps individuals confront and overcome any resistance they may face during a feast, while the Sanctuary coach assists individuals in navigating the challenges they encounter in the emergent flow.
Encouraging Mindfulness and Presence: Both the tantric guru and the Sanctuary coach emphasize the importance of mindfulness and presence during their respective processes. They encourage participants to be fully present in the moment, aware of their thoughts, feelings, and sensations, and open to the transformative experiences unfolding before them.
In summary, the role of a Sanctuary coach in emergent flow coaching and a tantric guru in a feast share many similarities. Both guides are dedicated to creating safe and supportive environments, facilitating transformative experiences, and empowering individuals to tap into their own inner resources and wisdom.
