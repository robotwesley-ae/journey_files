ok so i have a memoir document i wrote. it is not in chronological order. in other words, I actually want to make scripts that will clean the data for me... that's all, then I think loading this onto a neo4j database would allow one to begin to draw relationships and add nodes when one makes inferences, right? One could even use mining algorithms to look for relationships, right?
I would like to be able to just write a document and have it automatically be sorted into the proper neo4j database so I can query it 

i would like to be able to get things like:
list of years
list of events
list of places
list of people
list of things
list of activities
a document of each events of each year
a document of each timeline of events associated with each noun
a document of each timeline of emotions and their associated nouns
a document of each timeline of activities and their associated nouns

Then, is it true I really need to prepare the data at all?? I am fine with it being messy and having to add classes and so on inside of neo4j through cypher
You're right that loading the data into a Neo4j database will allow you to draw relationships and add nodes as you make inferences. You can also use graph algorithms in Neo4j to analyze and discover relationships within your data.
If you want to load your memoir document into Neo4j and have it automatically sorted and structured, you can follow these steps:
Pre-process the document:
Use natural language processing (NLP) techniques or scripts to extract entities (people, places, events, etc.) and their relationships from your memoir. For this task, you can use NLP libraries like SpaCy, NLTK, or TextBlob in Python.
Create a script to parse the extracted data:
Write a script to parse the extracted entities and relationships into a format suitable for Neo4j, such as CSV or JSON. This will involve organizing the data into nodes (e.g., years, events, places, people) and relationships (e.g., participated_in, located_at).
Load the data into Neo4j:
Import the structured data into Neo4j using the LOAD CSV command for CSV files or the apoc.load.json procedure for JSON files. This will create nodes and relationships in your graph based on the parsed data.
Query the data using Cypher:
Use Cypher queries to extract the information you're interested in, such as timelines, events, activities, and emotions. You can create and save these documents as query results or export them to external files.
Keep in mind that the quality of your results will depend on the quality of the pre-processing and data extraction. While you don't necessarily need to clean the data beforehand, doing so may improve the accuracy and usefulness of your graph. Once the data is in Neo4j, you can further refine and organize it using Cypher queries.

I can provide you with an outline of the steps needed to pre-process the document and parse the extracted data. Since I cannot directly run code, I'll provide you with examples to help you get started. You can then adapt and expand on this code as needed.
Pre-process the document using NLP techniques:
First, you'll need to install the necessary NLP library (e.g., SpaCy) and its language model. You can do this using pip in your Python environment:
Copy code
pip install spacy python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
Then, you can create a Python script to process your text document:
python
Copy code
