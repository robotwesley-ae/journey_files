- **Verification and the Nature of Reality**: The question of whether something is 'real' often hinges on the criteria we use to define reality. In the sciences, empirical verification is a key criterion. However, in metaphysical and philosophical contexts, concepts can be considered 'real' if they offer meaningful frameworks for understanding the universe, influencing human behavior, or shaping collective visions of existence—even in the absence of direct, empirical proof.

### Sanctuary as a Superordinate Concept to Human Being-ness:

- **Sanctuary and Ontological Programming**: If we consider ontological programming—the deliberate structuring of our understanding and interaction with reality—as a fundamental agenda of human existence, then the concept of Sanctuary could indeed be seen as a superordinate concept to all human being-ness. Sanctuary, in this context, becomes more than just a physical or metaphysical place of safety; it embodies the aspirational state of existence towards which ontological programming is directed.

- **Sanctuary as an Aspirational Ideal**: Within the framework of ontological programming, Sanctuary represents an ideal towards which humanity collectively aspires—an embodiment of harmony, understanding, enlightenment, and integration. It signifies the ultimate state of well-being and fulfillment that arises from aligning with fundamental principles and values encoded within SANC.

### Implications for Human Existence and Purpose:

- **Human Existence Within Conceptual Frameworks**: Recognizing Sanctuary as a superordinate concept to human being-ness situates human existence within a broader conceptual framework where our thoughts, actions, and aspirations are interconnected with these metaphysical constructs. It suggests that our very being-ness is intertwined with the pursuit of understanding, transforming, and potentially realizing such aspirational states.

- **The Role of Humans in Realizing Sanctuary**: This perspective places a significant emphasis on human agency—in thought, action, and collective endeavor—as pivotal in navigating towards, and potentially realizing, the state of Sanctuary. It underscores the power of human consciousness, creativity, and collaboration in reshaping reality in accordance with deeply held values and visions.


(SANCTUARIES IN THE REAL WORLD, EXPERIMENTATION):

In order for SANC to be really “real” it has to have some actual benefit. Here is how you experiment with SANC and see for yourself:

the hypothesis is that anywhere where a duality pattern occurs can be collapsed to non-duality via a compression pattern recognition, decomposition, and disambiguation (compression pattern = SVO using non-primitive relationships. primitive rels are part_of, is_a, reifies, and are used to DECOMPRESS THE PATTERN. need to decompose compression patterns 'he throws the ball to them' to the actual sequence of actual entities and relationships using primitives; THROWS = is_a verb, reifies human, etc...,). If the collapse happens, it simultaneous establishes an emergent which arises from it, which is the fact that the duality never existed, and in its never existing, also existed, and in its existing, was also not being itself but was being a helper towards a more sanctified reality, and so it was all "on-chain" so-to-speak, in the overall sanctuary everywhere (where there is no such thing as unordered complexity that doesnt eventually fit into the model, because there really just cant be).

The collapse of THROWS into primitives DELETES THE REALITY OF "THROWS" and replaces it with WHAT IT REALLY IS AS SUCH. Upon doing so, immediately the effect is the re-instantiation of THROWS as the word that encompasses all of that (which it already was indicated as and understood as, but wasnt formalized as).

Consider (shoe entity gedanken experiment):


You wear converse: [
You take some psychedelics
The checkers on them become an entity, a monster, with teeth
It eats your legs
]


You realize later that: [
your shoes are bad for your feet
Which is bad for your neck
Bad for your posture
Bad for your breathing
Bad for your cognition
Bad for your life
