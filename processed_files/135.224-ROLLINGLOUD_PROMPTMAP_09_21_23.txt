Kevin, his frustration mounting, turns to Chad, trying to balance politeness with the urgency of the situation.
KEVIN Chad, I appreciate your help, but I really need to focus on finding Zion right now. Can you please give me some space?
Chad, sensing Kevin's distress and urgency, reluctantly backs off, understanding the gravity of the situation.
CHAD Yeah, sure, Kevin. I get it. Just let me know if you need anything, okay?
Kevin nods, his determination renewed as he watches Chad step back. He takes a deep breath, pushing aside the distractions around him. The weight of the situation rests heavily on his shoulders as he pushes through the crowd, searching for any sign of his beloved son.
With every step, his focus sharpens, his eyes scanning the faces of the festival-goers, desperately seeking any glimpse of Zion's familiar features. The pulsating energy of the venue becomes background noise as his determination takes over.
KEVIN (persistent) Excuse me, have you seen a young boy named Zion? He's about 13 years old.
SELFIE-TAKING GIRL #1 (ignoring Kevin) Hold on, let me get the perfect angle.
SELFIE-TAKING GIRL #2 (whispering to her friend) Is that guy seriously looking for a kid at a festival like this?
Kevin's heart sinks even further, his frustration mounting. He continues his relentless search, calling out Zion's name whenever he can, his voice strained and desperate.
KEVIN (desperate) Zion! Where are you? Please, if anyone has seen him, let me know!
Some festival-goers cast judgmental glances at Kevin, shaking their heads disapprovingly, but he is too consumed by his quest to pay them any mind. He stuffs another bite of food into his mouth, his mind racing with worst-case scenarios.
In the midst of the chaos, Kevin's love for his son propels him forward, driving him to search every corner of the festival. His determination is unwavering, his focus laser-sharp. Nothing will stop him until he finds Zion and holds him safely in his arms once again.
