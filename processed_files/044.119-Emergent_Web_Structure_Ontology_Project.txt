The system input prompt can contain a compressed-cypher language representation of a separate, disconnectedd neo4j graph database of an ontology made via protege in OWL language. 

as we consider what the algorithm will be, know we will be using OWL. the system input prompt will also contain an OWL primer, as well as definitions for EWSO, informatihedron, informadlib, and any custom ontology language we need to devise to get the function to work, as well as the algorithm for SemOntoRel (thats this that we are talking about). 

Lets think of the space as a knowledge graph
I believe that as you have said, it is complicated to make the algorithm go to the next superclass correctly for any given search purpose
an input is a search query for a desired instance of something (X)
the output should be the informadlib template of X, btu how should this be accomplished?

I believe we should have the user do a custom walk from node to node, designing their own EWSO (emergent web structure ontology) dynamically, as they go, and the output is filling in the informadlib template accordingly, while also showing them the display of the node they are on right now as an informatihedron. 

"The Informadlib Template can be thought of as a guide or blueprint for generating specific instances of information in a system. The Informatihedron is the multidimensional conceptual space wherein these instances and their properties exist and interact. The EWSO is the dynamic, evolving framework that encapsulates these interactions and provides a way to understand and track these changes over time."
 to make GPT output a node like that, we need to devise a way to make it do so using OWL terminology. That is the algorithm. The algorithm is the way we tell GPT to output an OWL frame of the informatihedron of X. We need to correctly, therefore, define the informatihedron in terms of which OWL terminology the output should display about an ENTITY, which here is a node.

Now, let's remember that this is not strictly OWL, but OWL+GPT which is special. We can query GPT for multiple levels of properties and so on at once using commands like InstanceLevelProperty, DomainLevelClassPropertyTemplate, ClassLevelClassPropertyTemplate, InstanceTemplate, and so on. 

We can also use these terms and custom define them in order to create the algorithm we need to make this automatically, so the user gets a fully defined informatihedron of whatever they want. 

REMEMBER: THERE IS NOT AN OWL ONTOLOGY ANYWHERE. THERE ARE ONLY CUSTOM DEFINED TERMINOLOGY EXPLOITING GPT'S KNOWLEGE OF OWL FRAMEWORK APPLICATION TO MAKE A FUNCTIONAL EWSO SEMONTOREL (SemanticOntologicalRelationship) ALGORTIHMIC FRAMEWORK THAT AUTOMATICALLY CAPTURES THE PROPER INSTANCELEVEL.INSTANCEPROPERTY-PROPERTY.VALUE->CLASSLEVEL.INSTANCEPROPERTY-PROPERTY.SPECTRUMConceptualBOUNDARY which means InstanceLevel (This person) Instance Property (Has_property.array) Property Value (Array values) 
-> ClassLevel (all people) InstanceProperty (with such property array values)  PropertySpectrumConceptualBoundary"

Absolutely, we should definitely anchor our discussions around OWL as the standard ontology language. The idea of creating an OWL+GPT system is a new approach, and the concepts you've mentioned are very insightful. Now, let's define some of these terms more precisely:
InstanceTemplate: A term we use to represent a specific instance or entity in the ontology. It corresponds to the OWL concept of Individual.
InstanceLevelProperty: This refers to properties that are specific to an instance or entity. It maps to the OWL property construct where properties are assigned to specific instances.
DomainLevelClassPropertyTemplate: This can be considered as a way to query for properties that are common to a set of entities belonging to a particular class in the ontology. In OWL terms, these would be properties defined at the Class level.
ClassLevelClassPropertyTemplate: This term can be interpreted as querying for properties that are defined at a higher superclass level. This corresponds to inherited properties in OWL.
