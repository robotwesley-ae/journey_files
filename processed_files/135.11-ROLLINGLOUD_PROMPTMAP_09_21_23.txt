write a personal introduction to this treatment, stating that this is all inspired from real life events that happened to me and my son.

Before we dive into the treatment, I want to share a personal story that inspired this movie. It all started when my son, who was just 13 at the time, became obsessed with the Rolling Loud festival. As a protective and slightly overbearing father, I was hesitant to let him attend such a large and overwhelming event. However, my son was persistent and eventually convinced me to take him to the festival.
What followed was a wild and unforgettable adventure that included getting lost in the crowd, accidentally joining a mosh pit, and stumbling upon unexpected performances and encounters with other festival-goers. While the experience was certainly overwhelming for me, it was also eye-opening and allowed me to see a side of hip-hop culture that I had never experienced before.
As I reflect on that experience, I realize that it inspired a movie that explores the struggle between a father's protectiveness and a son's desire for independence, set against the backdrop of one of the largest hip-hop festivals in the world. I hope you enjoy this treatment and can relate to the themes and experiences that inspired it.
