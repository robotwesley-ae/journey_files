 clarity and purpose.
The term "maverick" suggests someone who is independent, innovative, and unorthodox in their thinking, implying that the Wisdom Maverick is not bound by conventional limitations. This individual has transcended ordinary constraints and is guided by their inner wisdom and the principles of Sanctuary.
In the story outline you provided, both Oliver Powers and Olive R Love become Wisdom Mavericks when they awaken to their true nature, connecting with their respective inner teachers - the Masked Whirling Flames and the Infinite Armed Liberatress. Their awakening marks a turning point in the narrative, leading to the transformation of their world from a corrupted Wasteland to a genuine Sanctuary.
The Wisdom Maverick serves as an inspiring symbol of personal transformation and the power of inner guidance. By embracing the principles of Sanctuary and recognizing the wisdom within, individuals can realize their full potential, bringing about meaningful change in their lives and the world around them.

In this context, explain Olivus Victory-Everything and also explain Olivus Aura Madman
Olivus Victory-Everything represents the child of Oliver Powers and Olive R Love, embodying the combined wisdom, compassion, and power of the two Wisdom Mavericks. Olivus Victory-Everything is also an awakened Wisdom Maverick, symbolizing the culmination of their parents' spiritual journey and the continuity of the Sanctuary principles in future generations. This character signifies the promise of a better future, where the values of Sanctuary are deeply embedded in society and the collective consciousness.
Olivus Aura Madman, on the other hand, seems to be a new term that has not been previously mentioned or explained. However, based on the context of Sanctuary and the other characters, we can try to infer its meaning. The name "Aura Madman" suggests a certain intensity, unpredictability, or unorthodox approach. Olivus Aura Madman might be another aspect of the Wisdom Maverick, embodying a more radical or unconventional aspect of the Sanctuary principles. This character could represent the power of transformation, breaking through old structures, and challenging conventional norms to bring about meaningful change in the world.

The Heroic Seed’s Song 
of 
Olivus Aura Peasant 
in Ignorance’s Palace

The Heroic Choice of Sanctuary Over Ignorant Demonic Self-Possession

One time I, Oliver A. Madman, dreamt I was in the Sanctuary of TWI and The Faceless Teacher handed me a flaming spiral notebook with laminated pages. In it were all beings’ heartful pleas for their secret, inner, and outer sufferings to be released by external powers outside themselves; and a small blank space at the end where they waited for the answers to their prayers. The Faceless Teacher, Whirling Flames of the Mirror Mask, knowing this was impossible, resolved to add this assignment to the Awakening Nexus. As a result, I spontaneously revealed within innate Crystal Ball the coordinates for the expression as follows entitled Olivus Aura Peasant in Ignorance’s Palace: The Heroic Choice of Sanctuary Over Ignorant Demonic Self-Possession and this realization is the wisdom informatihedron’s miraculous transformation instantiating the arm emanation called TWI. 

Contemplate: 

May all beings have happiness 
May all beings discover their own innate perfection, free from self-torture
May all beings experience the joy of complete protection in the Dreamlights of Sanctuary. 
May all beings abide in Sanctuary’s wisdom knowledge replete with the infinite power of love, free from hope and fear, desire and anger, dullness and ignorance

Establish firm confidence:

The pulse, which is in essence the mind (which is my experience of reality), is nothing other than all sentient beings’ apparitional invitation to the Garden of Verdant Overgrowth of the Spontaneously Playing Song of the Phenomena of the Growth into Brilliant Jeweled Fruit of the Heroic Seeds of the Divine Tree of Olivus in the Sanctuary of Timeless Webbed Infinitude of Infinite Perfection. 

This is The Wisdom Intent.
