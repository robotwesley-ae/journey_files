Later that night, Kevin is scouring the Rolling Loud website when Melanie steps into the room. They share a glance, silently acknowledging their trial separation and their attempts to keep Zion in the dark. "There’s no way we’re letting him go to that Rolling Loud festival," Melanie says firmly. "Of course not. He’s only thirteen," Kevin replies, his voice laced with a hint of defensiveness. Melanie can't help but feel a twinge of frustration at Kevin's reaction. "Remember what happened at Disneyland?" she asks, her tone accusatory. "Of course, Melanie. I remember," Kevin responds, his voice clipped. "I was the one there. You don't have to keep reminding me." Memories of that fateful day at Disneyland flood back to Kevin. Zion had been so excited to go on all the rides, but Kevin had been preoccupied with work emails and phone calls. He had let his guard down for just a moment, and that's all it took. Zion had wandered off, and by the time Kevin had realized he was missing, he was nowhere to be found. The frantic search that followed was one of the worst moments of Kevin's life. "I don't want to put him in that situation again." Melanie insists. They both know that they need to find a solution, but there's a palpable tension between them as they struggle to find common ground. "Maybe we can come up with a compromise. Offer him something else he might like," Melanie suggests. Kevin's reply is hesitant. "Like what?" "I don't know. Maybe a day trip somewhere he's always wanted to go. We can make it a family thing," Melanie suggests. "That's a good idea. We'll talk to him about it and see if he's interested," Kevin agrees, but the tension remains. "We have to make sure he knows that we're not saying no to Rolling Loud just to be mean. We're doing it because we love him and want what's best for him," Melanie says, trying to ease the tension. "Absolutely. His safety and well-being come first," Kevin says, but Melanie can't help but feel like there's something else he's not saying. / write the above into FDX format
