
LINDA:
(Whispers)
I can do this.
She leaps, but a gust of wind intervenes. She screams, plummeting, her scream echoing eerily.
KEVIN:
Linda! No...
CHAD:
Stay focused, man!
Chad, surveying the structure, notices the pulley system. He moves with deliberate precision.
CHAD:
I've seen this before. Like that crux on Half Dome.
He jumps onto the pulley system. It groans under his weight but holds. With immense effort, Chad slides down partway, then climbs back up, drenched in sweat.
KEVIN:
This isn't El Cap, Chad!
CHAD:
Everything’s a climb if you look at it right.
KEVIN:
I’m not dying up here.
Kevin spots the GIGANTIC TEDDY BEAR.
KEVIN:
Our way out.
They move with painstaking precision on the central beam, every footstep a potential fall. Chad, driven by adrenaline, loses focus.
CHAD:
Watch this!
He slips, dangling precariously.
KEVIN:
Chad! Don’t let go!
But Chad falls, leaving Kevin in a silent shock.
KEVIN:
(To himself)
One move at a time.
Kevin reaches the teddy bear pod, confronts a TEENAGER, and manages to grab the bear. He takes a breath, then jumps.
GROUND LEVEL
Silence. A THUD as Kevin lands, cushioned by the bear. He’s winded, terrified, but alive.
Chad limps over, having miraculously survived. Linda appears, her fall broken by inflatable festival gear.
LINDA:
It’s about the climb, right?
CHAD:
I’m never climbing again.
KEVIN:
Neither am I.

Note: This screenplay combines the irreverent humor of Todd Phillips with the intense suspense of "Free Solo".
Great. Now rewrite in the style of Todd Phillips, but the danger of Cliffhanger
ChatGPT
Certainly! "Cliffhanger" is a high-octane action movie, where the peril feels palpable and every move is life and death. Let's dial up the suspense.

INT. FERRIS WHEEL POD - NIGHT
The pod sways ominously, creaking under the wind. The neon lights of the Rolling Loud Festival shimmer far below. Every noise echoes the danger of the height.
KEVIN:
(Gripping the rail)
We're sitting ducks up here!
LINDA:
There's a pod below. We can reach it.
CHAD:
(Scanning, a determined glint in his eyes)
It's just like scaling a cliff. We can do this.
KEVIN:
I'm not Stallone, and this isn't a movie, Chad!
CHAD:
But it's about survival!
With a fierce determination, Chad leaps, grasping the next pod's edge in the nick of time and pulling himself up. The pod sways dangerously under his weight.
CHAD:
(Panting)
Come on!
LINDA:
(Trembling)
I got this.
She leaps but misses, screaming as she plummets. Chad reaches out, catching her wrist just in time.
CHAD:
Don’t you dare let go!
Kevin watches, heart pounding, as Chad pulls Linda up. They share a fleeting, intense look.
KEVIN:
We need to get off this death trap.
Chad, always the risk-taker, eyes the Ferris wheel's pulley system.
CHAD:
That's our way down. Like rappelling off a cliff.
Before Kevin can protest, Chad jumps onto the pulley. It groans, threatening to break. With grit, Chad slides down partway, then somehow manages to rejoin Kevin.
KEVIN:
Are you insane?
CHAD:
Just focused.
Kevin spots the MASSIVE TEDDY BEAR, a potential lifesaver.
KEVIN:
We use that.
The duo, reinvigorated, make a treacherous traverse on the beam. Every gust of wind threatens to send them plummeting. Chad, pushing his luck, goes for a daring swing.
KEVIN:
Chad, don’t!
Chad loses his grip, letting out a scream as he disappears into the void.
KEVIN:
Damn it!
Driven by sheer willpower, Kevin reaches the teddy bear, confronts a DRUNKEN TEEN, and secures the plush lifesaver. Taking a moment to focus, he leaps.
GROUND LEVEL
The deafening sound of the festival returns. Kevin lands hard, the teddy bear cushioning his fall.
Against all odds, Chad, battered but alive, stumbles over.
CHAD:
Thought you lost me, huh?
KEVIN:
I swear, Chad, next time we’re just watching the concert.

Note: This version infuses the intense action and suspense of "Cliffhanger" with Todd Phillips' unique brand of humor.
