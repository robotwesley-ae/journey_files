Design the system in a modular way, separating the components responsible for the Markov chain modeling, the FSM, and the mining of emergency engines. This allows for easier maintenance, upgrades, and modifications as needed.
Implement the system using a programming language that supports working with probabilistic models, FSMs, and complex data structures. Languages like Python or R are good choices, as they have extensive libraries and tools for working with these types of models.
Test and validate the system on a range of emergent phenomena and scenarios to ensure it can effectively discover Markov blankets, boundaries, and mine emergency engines.
By refining the expressions and following these design steps, you can create a system that effectively models and analyzes the complex and uncertain nature of emergent phenomena and their underlying structures.

Express the formalizations of the dynamics of the concepts we have discussed in whatever language you find best suited to the purpose. 

Given the complex nature of the concepts we've discussed, I believe using a combination of set theory and first-order logic can help express the formalizations of the dynamics involved. Here's an attempt to express some of the key concepts:

Let P = {p1, p2, ..., pn} be the set of perceived phenomena (emergents).
Let S = {s1, s2, ..., sm} be the set of states, where each state represents a stage in the process of understanding emergents. For example, emergency hallucinations, programs that discover proper words, non-contradictory systems, and engines of those systems composed of building blocks concatenated.
Define a function f: P → S that maps each perceived phenomenon to a state in the process of understanding the emergent.
Let T = {t1, t2, ..., tk} be the set of transitions between states in S, capturing the relationships between different stages of perception and understanding.
Define a function g: S × S → T that maps pairs of states to transitions, representing the change from one state to another in the process of understanding emergents.
Let M = {m1, m2, ..., mq} be the set of Markov blankets and boundaries discovered within the process of understanding emergents.
Define a function h: S → M that maps each state in the process of understanding emergents to a Markov blanket or boundary.
Let E = {e1, e2, ..., er} be the set of emergency engines identified from mining the Markov blankets and boundaries.
Define a function i: M → E that maps each Markov blanket or boundary to an emergency engine.
Using these formalizations, we can express the relationships between the perceived phenomena, the states involved in understanding emergents, the transitions between those states, and the discovery and mining of Markov blankets, boundaries, and emergency engines.

These expressions can be further refined and adapted to specific problem domains, scenarios, and computational models, depending on the requirements and goals of the analysis.

Further refine and adapt them to any specific problem domain as a scenario example such that it is realizable as a computable model

As an example, let's consider a problem domain of natural language understanding, where the goal is to comprehend the meaning of a given text and identify relevant concepts, relationships, and insights.

Let P = {p1, p2, ..., pn} be the set of perceived phenomena (emergents) in the text, such as sentences, phrases, or words that appear to convey meaning or express a concept.
Let S = {s1, s2, s3, s4} be the set of states involved in understanding the emergents, where:
s1: emergency hallucinations (due to improper language usage or ambiguous phrases),
s2: programs that discover proper words or concepts,
s3: non-contradictory systems (capturing relationships between words and concepts),
s4: engines of those systems composed of building blocks concatenated (e.g., ontologies, knowledge graphs).
Define a function f: P → S that maps each perceived phenomenon (word, phrase, or sentence) to a state in the process of understanding the emergent.
