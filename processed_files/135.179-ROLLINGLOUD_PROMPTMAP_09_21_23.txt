This version keeps Linda's fall grounded in the structures and materials you might realistically find in and around a Ferris wheel.
A large, springy cable. BONK! She bounces off a pod's metal support. Into net / use these beats for the flashback in this order

Absolutely, let's integrate those specific beats into the flashback.

INT./EXT. FERRIS WHEEL POD - THE PEAK - NIGHT
The Ferris wheel groans to a sudden stop. Kevin, Chad, Linda, Brittany, and Tiffany are trapped at its zenith.
KEVIN:
"That’s exactly where he posted from. He’s down there. I need to get down now."
Kevin makes a bold leap to a neighboring pod. Chad and the girls brace themselves.
LINDA:
"I can do that too."
She takes a leap, but her momentum is off.
LINDA'S PERCEPTION:
Time slows. Linda senses herself descending. Festival lights blur beneath her, and the ground appears distant and foreboding. She reaches futilely towards the pod.
BACK TO REALITY:
The group watches, faces pale with shock.
CHAD:
"She's... she's falling!"
BRITTANY & TIFFANY:
"...Oh my God."
KEVIN:
(teary-eyed)
"I... I can't watch."
The Ferris wheel continues its descent, every creak a grim reminder.

EXT. FESTIVAL GROUNDS - NIGHT
As the pod lands, they expect the worst. But they’re greeted by festival laughter and music. Linda, slightly disheveled but otherwise fine, greets them cheerily.
LINDA:
"Hey there! You all look like you've seen a ghost."
KEVIN:
(stammering)
"But... we saw..."
LINDA:
"A terrifying fall? Oh, you bet."
FLASHBACK:
As Linda descends:
SLIDE! Linda's foot catches on a large, springy cable which temporarily slows her descent. Her momentum causes her to swing to one side.
BONK! Her unexpected sideways motion leads her straight into a pod's metal support. It looks painful but redirects her path and slows her down even further.
PLUMMET! Linda braces herself for impact as the ground rushes toward her. However, she lands surprisingly soft - right into a safety net installed for maintenance purposes.
A few festival maintenance workers rush over, startled by the unexpected "drop-in."
WORKER:
"Ma'am, that's not a bungee jump!"
LINDA:
(embarrassed)
"Guess I found out the hard way."
BACK TO THE PRESENT:
LINDA:
"Who knew safety measures would actually come in handy? Oh, right, probably the safety inspectors."
CHAD:
(chuckling)
"We thought you were gone, and here you are, cracking jokes?"
LINDA:
"Life's short. Or, at least, falls can be."
They all laugh, the tension of the previous moments melting away.

This version emphasizes the three specific beats you highlighted for Linda's fall.
