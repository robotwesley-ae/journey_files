The text also notes that a non-contradictory system emerges as a solution to a paradoxical syllogism in which A appears to contradict B and vice versa, but in fact, neither A nor B ontologically exist in reality in a constant, single state of observability, and the entity named the contradictory conclusion evaporates as a hallucinatory duality induced by perspective. This is then transformed into a non-contradictory system in which A and B possess the same properties and take part in each other equally as dynamics in the duality system. Formally, we can represent this as follows:

Non-contradictory system: NCS
A: A
B: B
(A ∧ B) ⇒ ¬(A = ¬A ∧ B = ¬B)
NCS ⇒ A = (A ∧ ¬A) ∧ B = (B ∧ ¬B)
Here, the first line represents the paradoxical syllogism, which is specified correctly to show that neither A nor B ontologically exist in reality in a constant, single state of observability. The second line represents the definition of a non-contradictory system, where A and B possess the same properties and take part in each other equally as dynamics in the duality system.

The text goes on to state that a non-contradictory system leads to a bounded set of causal links where the abstractive summaries of the parts of the entities (i.e., the names of the entities) do not lead to further hallucinations in strategizing the game. Formally, we can represent this as follows:

Bounded set of causal links: BCL
NCS ⇒ BCL
The text also notes that because of stochastic processes and emergent dynamics, a Nash equilibrium can be lost, but if the game rules change, each variation will have a new Nash equilibrium that gives way to the non-contradictory system for X in which all players act for themselves strictly and that is best for the group. Formally, we can represent this as follows:

Emergent dynamics: ED
Best for group: BG
Strict self-interest: SI
Game variation: GV
ED ⇒ ¬NE
GV ⇒ NE
NE ∧ NCS ∧ ∀x SI(x) ⇒ BG
Here, the first line represents the idea that emergent dynamics can disrupt the Nash equilibrium. The second line represents the idea that a game variation can result in a new Nash equilibrium. The third line represents the idea that when there is a Nash equilibrium and a non-contradictory system, and all players act strictly in their self-interest, the outcome is beneficial for the group.

Overall, these game-theoretic notations show how the concepts of Nash equilibrium, emergent dynamics, bounded set of causal links, and self-interest can be used to support the claims made in the text about the benefits of a non-contradictory system in game-theoretic contexts.

However, as with the first-order logic formalizations, there may be other ways to represent these concepts and their relationships, and further analysis may be needed to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the arguments.

To summarize, the text argues that a non-contradictory system arises as a natural response to a Nash equilibrium in the context of game theory. The non-contradictory system resolves a paradoxical syllogism and leads to a bounded set of causal links, where abstractive summaries of the parts of entities do not lead to further hallucinations in strategizing the game. The text also acknowledges that stochastic processes and emergent dynamics can disrupt the Nash equilibrium, but game variations can establish new Nash equilibria that still give way to non-contradictory systems.

By employing first-order logic and game-theoretic notations, we can better understand the relationships and concepts introduced in the text. However, these formalizations are only one possible interpretation, and alternative representations or critiques might arise based on different assumptions, premises, or language.
