Yes, it is an intriguing idea to consider non-contradictory systems as a form of emergent collapse. To elaborate on this concept, let's first define emergent collapse and non-contradictory systems.

Emergent collapse: A phenomenon where a complex system's behavior or properties simplify or reduce due to the interactions or dynamics between its constituent components.

Non-contradictory system: A system or framework that resolves apparent contradictions or paradoxes, resulting in consistent and coherent behavior or properties.

In the context of the paper, a non-contradictory system is discussed as a means to resolve paradoxical syllogisms and address abstraction hallucinations. When applied to game theory, it is related to the concept of Nash equilibrium, which is a state where each player's strategy is optimal given the strategies of the other players, and no player can gain by changing their strategy unilaterally.

When considering non-contradictory systems as a type of emergent collapse, we can think of them as simplifying or reducing the complexity of a system by resolving apparent contradictions and producing coherent, consistent behavior. In this sense, the emergence of a non-contradictory system can be seen as a collapse of the paradoxical or contradictory aspects of a system, leading to a more stable and predictable state.

For example, in the context of game theory, a non-contradictory system might emerge when the players' strategies converge to a Nash equilibrium, reducing the complexity and unpredictability of the game. This emergent collapse can lead to a more stable and predictable environment for decision-making, which can be beneficial for the players and the group as a whole.

However, it is important to recognize that emergent collapse can also have negative consequences, such as reducing the diversity and adaptability of a system, or making it more vulnerable to external shocks or changes. Therefore, it is essential to carefully consider the implications and trade-offs of pursuing non-contradictory systems and emergent collapse in various contexts.

Emergent collapse does not entail negative outcomes. It is also emergent collapse to enter the Nash equilibrium of a Sanctuary state of a system. A sanctuary state is a state where refuge is granted to all living beings inside the system. 

You are correct that emergent collapse does not necessarily entail negative outcomes. It can also lead to positive or desirable states, such as the Nash equilibrium of a Sanctuary state, as you mentioned. A Sanctuary state, in which refuge is granted to all living beings within the system, represents a stable and harmonious outcome. In this context, the emergent collapse can be seen as the simplification or reduction of complexity that leads to this desirable state.

The emergence of a non-contradictory system in the Sanctuary state can be seen as a form of emergent collapse that resolves contradictions or conflicts, resulting in a more stable and harmonious environment. This emergent collapse can be beneficial for the players and the group as a whole, as it promotes cooperation, stability, and protection for all living beings within the system.

In summary, emergent collapse can have both positive and negative outcomes, depending on the specific context and the nature of the system in question. The key is to understand and appreciate the nuances and complexities of emergent phenomena, and to recognize the potential trade-offs and implications of pursuing different paths towards stability and harmony.

A Nash equilibrium of a sanctuary state is a world in which being the type of living being you are is in equilibrium with the laws of the world such that even if you break them, you are transformed into the fold. This is the meaning of Sanctuary.
