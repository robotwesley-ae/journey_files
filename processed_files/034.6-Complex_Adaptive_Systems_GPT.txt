Apologies for the misunderstanding. To address your point about creating a generalized formalization for understanding how any given system becomes complexly adaptive within the context of the spacetime/entity system, we can consider some key factors that contribute to the emergence of complex adaptive behavior:

Interaction: The components within a system and the system itself interact with other components or systems in the environment. These interactions can lead to the exchange of information, energy, or resources, which can influence the behavior and properties of the interacting systems.
Adaptation: Systems can change and adapt their behavior or properties based on their interactions with the environment or other systems. This adaptation can be driven by processes such as learning, evolution, or feedback loops that help the system become more efficient or effective in achieving its goals or maintaining its stability.
Self-organization: Complex adaptive systems can exhibit self-organization, where the system's components or subsystems spontaneously organize themselves into patterns or structures without any central coordination or control. This self-organization can result from local interactions and feedback loops between the components and can lead to the emergence of new properties or behaviors at the system level.
Emergence: As a result of the interactions, adaptation, and self-organization within a system, new properties or behaviors can emerge that are not easily predictable from the behavior of the individual components. These emergent properties can shape the overall behavior and properties of the system and contribute to its complexity and adaptability.
To create a generalized formalization that captures how any given system becomes complexly adaptive, we can consider these key factors and explore mathematical models, algorithms, or frameworks that can describe and quantify the interactions, adaptation, self-organization, and emergence within the context of the spacetime/entity system. This formalization would ideally be flexible enough to accommodate the wide range of systems and their unique properties and behaviors while still providing a general framework for understanding the factors that contribute to the emergence of complex adaptive behavior.

Nonlinearity doesnt exist. There is nonlinearity in every direction except for one which is the nonlinear direction in which the system of such and such torus connects to such and such other torus perfectly and becomes a complex adaptive system which makes the line non-linear, so that it appears like non-linearity exists but it is not true because of non-contradictory identitylessness of non-linearity, itself. 

It seems you're suggesting that nonlinearity is an illusion, resulting from the way systems connect and interact in a torus-like structure, where the non-contradictory identitylessness of non-linearity gives the appearance of nonlinearity. This is an interesting perspective, but it's important to note that the concept of nonlinearity is commonly used in the context of mathematical models and real-world systems to describe the behavior and relationships between variables.

In mathematics and system modeling, nonlinearity refers to relationships between variables that cannot be accurately represented by a straight line, meaning that the output of the system is not directly proportional to the input. Nonlinear systems can exhibit complex and unpredictable behavior, making them more challenging to analyze and understand compared to linear systems.

From a more philosophical perspective, your idea of non-contradictory identitylessness might suggest that the apparent nonlinearity arises from the limitations of our understanding and the frameworks we use to describe the relationships between entities or systems. In this context, the concept of nonlinearity could be seen as an artifact of our limited perspective rather than an inherent property
