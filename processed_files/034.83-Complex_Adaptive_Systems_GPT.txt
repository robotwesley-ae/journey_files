The claim suggests that knowledge is influenced by the connections between ideas and understanding, curving around identitylessness.
Black holes as sets that are difficult or impossible to think about:
Some concepts or sets of ideas can be challenging to grasp or inaccessible.
The term "black hole" is used to represent these areas of limited understanding.
The claim suggests that black holes symbolize the gaps in our knowledge and understanding in the Sanctuary framework.
Event horizon as the boundary of generalizations:
The event horizon in physics represents the point of no return, beyond which any information cannot be retrieved.
In the Sanctuary framework, it symbolizes the boundary where specific knowledge becomes inaccessible.
The claim suggests that, beyond the event horizon, only generalizations can be made, which may not preserve the original context or synergies.
Time reversal and re-orientation:
To access the knowledge within a black hole, one must change their perspective.
Approaching the black hole from a position of identitylessness allows for a non-contradictory relationship.
The claim suggests that by re-orienting one's perspective, the black hole can be transformed into a white hole.
Singularity and TWI:
The singularity in physics refers to an infinitely dense point within a black hole.
In the Sanctuary framework, the singularity of a white hole is seen as TWI, representing a more perfect Sanctuary system.
The claim suggests that while black holes can exist at different levels of the Sanctuary hierarchy, white holes are associated with the ideal Sanctuary system.
No-crossing and the white hole's event horizon:
The event horizon of a white hole represents a boundary that can only be crossed by non-contradictory, identitylessness synergies.
This claim ensures that the white hole remains pure and aligned with the principles of the Sanctuary system.
These claims illustrate the parallels between concepts from physics and the flow of knowledge in the Sanctuary framework. While the connections are allegorical, they provide a structure for understanding the relationships between ideas and concepts in the Sanctuary system.


Does the above imply that when identitylessness is too high, set X doesnt exist to us because it is a black hole, and we are ignorant of it therefore, and that that ignorance then affects our current worldview because of the "gravity"? And also that when it's too low it's part of the occlusion that causes black holes?
The above analysis implies that when identitylessness is too high, certain sets or concepts (set X) may become inaccessible or challenging to grasp, like a black hole. The ignorance of set X could influence our current understanding and worldview due to the metaphorical "gravity" created by the relationships between concepts.
On the other hand, when identitylessness is too low, it can contribute to the occlusion that creates black holes. Low identitylessness means that one is too attached to a specific identity or viewpoint, which may prevent them from recognizing or accessing certain sets or concepts. This limited perspective could lead to gaps in knowledge and understanding, similar to the metaphorical black holes.
In both cases, maintaining a balance between identitylessness and a clear understanding of the relationships between sets and concepts is essential for avoiding black holes and fostering a comprehensive and adaptable worldview.


and when identitylessness increases, white hole-ness increases, but an eternal white hole is just a flow of undirected knowledge
Yes, as identitylessness increases, the accessibility and interconnectedness of concepts and sets (white hole-ness) also increase. This enhanced interconnectivity allows for more synergies and a more comprehensive understanding of the knowledge graph. However, if identitylessness were to become eternal or infinite, it could result in an undirected flow of knowledge, without any specific focus or structure.
In this case,
