CHAD (standing tall) I'm Chad, Kevin's friend. And I won't let you take him away.
SECURITY GUARD 2 (angry) This is none of your business! Step aside!
CHAD (resolute) When it comes to my friend, it becomes my business. Back off!
The onlookers watch, captivated by the sudden turn of events. The security guards hesitate, unsure how to handle Chad's unexpected intervention.
KEVIN (relieved and grateful) Chad, thank you, but we need to find my son. Let's focus on that.
SECURITY GUARD 1 (reasserting authority) This is not over. We will deal with this later.
CHAD (standing his ground) Fine. But right now, finding Kevin's son is the priority.
The atmosphere remains charged, uncertainty lingering, as Kevin, Chad, and the security guards navigate the precarious balance between finding Zion and facing the consequences of their actions.

Write the following scene in FDX format: They continue running, covered in fire extinguisher powder, trying to put as much distance as possible between themselves and the security guards. Finally, they spot a relatively secluded area behind a row of concession stands. It seems like a good place to catch their breath and regroup. Kevin turns to Chad, his expression a mix of frustration and concern. "Chad, what were you thinking?!" Kevin exclaims, wiping the foam from his face. "Now we're both wanted by security! This isn't helping me find Zion!" Chad's smile falters, and he looks sheepish. "I'm sorry, Kevin. I just saw you in trouble and wanted to help. I didn't think it through." Kevin sighs, trying to control his anger. He knows Chad meant well, but the situation has become far more complicated than before. "Look," Kevin says, his voice tense but controlled. "I appreciate the help, but right now, I need to focus on finding my son. We can't afford any more distractions or delays." Chad nods solemnly, realizing the gravity of the situation.
