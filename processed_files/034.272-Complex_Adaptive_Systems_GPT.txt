 then reversing the problem will give most people new to this process a great place to start. For our purposes, we are giving ourselves a checklist of exactly what we are going to have to do for our prospects and what we are going to solve for them. Once we have our list of solutions, we will operationalize how we are actually going to solve these problems (create value) in the next step. And I want to be 100 percent clear. You will solve every problem. We’ll explore how together, in the next step. PROBLEM→ SOLUTION PROBLEM: Buying healthy food, grocery shopping . . . is hard, confusing, I won’t like it. I will suck at it→ How to make buying healthy food easy and enjoyable, so that anyone can do it (especially busy moms!) . . . takes too much time→ How to buy healthy food quickly . . . is expensive→ How to buy healthy food for less than your current grocery bill . . . is unsustainable→ How to make buying healthy food take less effort than buying unhealthy food . . . is not my priority. My family’s needs will get in my way→ How to buy healthy food for you and your family at the same time . . . is undoable if I travel; I won’t know what to get→ How to get healthy food when traveling PROBLEM: Cooking healthy food . . . is hard, confusing. I won’t like it, and I will suck at it→ How anyone can enjoy cooking healthy meals easily . . . will take too much time→ How to cook meals in under 5 minutes . . . is expensive, it’s not worth it→ How eating healthy is actually cheaper than unhealthy food . . . is unsustainable → How to make eating healthy last forever . . . is not my priority, my family’s needs will get in my way→ How to cook this despite your families concerns . . . is undoable if I travel I won’t know how to cook healthy→ How to travel and still cook healthy PROBLEM: Eating healthy food . . . is hard, confusing, and I won’t like it→ How to eat delicious healthy food, without following complicated systems . . . etc PROBLEM: Exercise Regularly . . . is hard, confusing, and I won’t like it, and I will suck at it → Easy to follow exercise system that everyone enjoys ….etc. Okay, whew. That’s a lot of problems (and a lot of intuited solutions courtesy of divergent thinking). You’ll also notice that a lot of them are repetitive. That’s totally normal. The value drivers are the four core reasons. Our problems always relate to those drivers, and our solutions provide the needed answer to give a prospect permission to purchase. What's even crazier: is that if only one of these needs is missing in a solution, it can cause someone not to buy. You would be amazed at the reasons people do not buy. So don’t limit yourself here. Brooke Castillo is a friend who runs an enormous life coaching business. To give you a different take on the problems-solutions list, Brooke sent me her list as she was going through this book to make a Grand Slam Offer for a 90-Day Relationship course. Take a look to see this process through a totally different lens. The main takeaway, though: Don’t be fancy. Just get all the problems down then turn them into solutions. Regardless of whether the offer you’re creating is around fitness (like the example), a relationship course (like Brooke), or something wildly different (like ear aches), we now know what we need to do. Step four is the how (and how to do it without breaking the bank).
