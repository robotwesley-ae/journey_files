Can you imagine an example of a specific hero’s journey story of the culture hero of Sanctuary using our conversation so far and the new information below? 

Note: in the following information, co-emergent flow is called emergency flow. 

Hallucinations happen because of context misalignment. Then they remain as hallucinations without full context until suddenly a context is brought to the set and it collapses into the simplicity of being a set of whatever it is, which can be referred to in cognition by a single abstraction. If that single abstraction is a linguistic expression that contains all of the required context to create the non-contradictory system of the set of whatever it is in the context of being a non-contradictory system, it will synergize with every other domain properly. This is called emergency building concatenation. The set of emergency building concatenations related to Olivus Victory-Promise is defined as the set of emergency building concatenations related to the linguistics of Olivus Victory-Promise, which is a realizable infinite feedback loop (domain specific emergency flow engine of an emergent [and said emergent is an emergency process in the overall emergency flow]) of being a knowing with gnosis that creates the full non-contradictory system of being a wisdom maverick by enabling the development of Olivus Victory-Everything (emergency flow cultivation). 

The process of developing emergency flow engines is described by the hero’s journey. It starts with deciding to try to be a hero in the context of being a person a certain way you are being that is not in accord with what we need to be doing and also not in accord with what you need to be doing and also not in accord with what they are doing but is something they shouldn’t be doing. Then you see a dragon in the dreamlights, but it’s so real that you feel like you woke up and there was a snake in your bed. So you meet the dragon and it attacks you. Then you start improvising and start doing a little bit of what you should be doing. Through trial and error, you eventually realize you have mastery over the dragon because the dragon is only attacking when you are doing what you shouldn’t be doing. When you know the dragon’s nature, the hallucination of attack collapses and then you realize the dragon was only attacking because it was guarding the Sanctuary of life. Then the hallucinations increase and the dragon introduces you to the evil dragons. You fight the evil dragons but they overpower you and capture the good dragon and the life waters. You realize the power of the dragon is inside you by learning about non-contradictory systems and you gain mastery over hallucinations by learning about Sanctuary systems. Then you go to fight the evil dragons and fully
