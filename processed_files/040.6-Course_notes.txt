At this point, people may start to get discouraged, thinking this is too complex, there’s too much, etc. That’s why we have a reintegration period where they can find what works for them. All the levels of practice access the same essential wisdom. Practices are only beneficial if they are effective. Therefore, you should practice what you want in this system, as long as you follow the basic daily cultivation routine.
Communal Basic Daily Cultivation Routine (ACT 3) (Weeks 11 & 12)
For the last two or so weeks of the course, we concentrate on being genuine and relaxing into this new life
We discuss obstacles
And people can ask questions about their practice
It is a time of return, where people will need to start their daily practice for real, encounter obstacles, ask questions, improvise, and overcome them, then return to the real world
