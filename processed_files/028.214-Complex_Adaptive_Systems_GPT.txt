the output got cut off
Apologies for that. Continuing from where it got cut off:
5.2. Identify the components needed for implementing trading bot logic and continuous surf strategy
5.2.1. List the required components such as data fetching, processing, and decision-making modules
5.2.2. Determine if any custom components need to be built or if existing ones can be adapted
5.3. Plan the data flow and communication between components
5.3.1. Design the data flow diagram to visualize how data will be processed and passed between components
5.3.2. Ensure that the data flow supports the continuous surf strategy and trading logic
