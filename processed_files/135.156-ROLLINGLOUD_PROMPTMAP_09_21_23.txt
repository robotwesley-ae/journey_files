As Linda makes her jump, she doesn’t quite make it to the other pod. Instead, her clothing snags on their original pod, leaving her suspended perilously between the two. Kevin immediately lunges forward, grabbing Linda's ankles while Chad, on the other side, seizes her wrists. The men strain to keep her from plummeting, their shouts echoing Linda's terrified screams. In a heart-stopping moment, Linda's clothing gives way, sending her tumbling down onto a beam five feet below. Grasping the beam with all her might, she's left in a perilous position, away from both pods.
Beam Dilemma: Understanding that they have to get Linda safely off the beam, Kevin makes the risky decision to climb down to her. With Chad's assistance, he manages to reach her position. The two men work together, with Kevin supporting Linda from below while Chad reaches down, trying to pull her up. After a few harrowing moments, they manage to hoist Linda back into the pod. They sit for a moment, hearts racing, as they gather their wits.
Spotting The Teddy Bear: From where they are, Kevin's eyes catch the sight of a giant teddy bear in a pod several meters below. A bold thought strikes him: could this plush toy serve as a cushion, easing their descent? But the challenge lies in getting to it.
The Beam Walk: Seeing that the Ferris wheel’s central beam offers a direct path to the teddy bear's pod, Kevin proposes they trek across it. He takes the lead, cautiously placing one foot ahead of the other, much like a tightrope artist. Linda, still shaky from her recent ordeal, and Chad follow closely, leaning on the structure for added support.
Another Close Call: As they traverse a particularly thin segment of the beam, Linda's foot slips. Once more, she's left hanging, a fall from the Ferris wheel imminent. Without hesitation, Kevin and Chad move to her rescue, one holding onto the beam while the other reaches for Linda, managing to secure her before she falls again.
The Final Leap: Once they approach the pod harboring the teddy bear, Kevin retrieves the stuffed toy, making sure to grip it firmly. He then positions himself, taking a deep breath before making his audacious leap off the Ferris wheel. The teddy bear, as hoped, breaks his fall, allowing him to land with a significant but not injurious impact.

The sequence is now filled with amplified tension and suspense, with Linda’s repeated brushes with danger and the trio's relentless attempts to ensure safety.
