Kevin, Chad, and Linda, disheveled and panting, sit amidst the wreckage of the vendor's tent. They exchange a glance, then burst out laughing.
KEVIN (laughs) You guys... we must look insane!
Linda, covered in silly string, shrugs with a grin.
LINDA (calmly) Eh, I've looked worse.
CHAD (teasing) Oh, yeah. Like the time you wore that lime green suit to prom?
KEVIN Wait...I did wear a green suit to prom.
CHAD I know. I was there.
KEVIN I looked good.
CHAD (teasing) You always look good.
They all laugh harder. After a beat, Kevin's laughter fades. He takes a deep breath, an air of seriousness creeping in.
KEVIN (sincere) Hey... can I share something with you guys?
Chad, still laughing, doesn't notice the shift. Linda, however, sobers quickly.
LINDA (sincere) Hey, you can tell us anything, Kevin.
Kevin swallows hard, glances at them, then looks back at the ground.
KEVIN (sadly) My wife and I... we're taking a break. A trial separation. It's been four months, three weeks, and two days... And Zion... he doesn't know yet. He thinks I sleep on the couch because she keeps it freezing in the bedroom. I...I don't know how to tell him.
CHAD (supportive) That's rough. But you're an amazing dad. And Zion loves you.
LINDA (supportive) Yeah. You'll figure it out.
KEVIN (emotional) I love her so much. I just feel like... I don’t know. I feel like I’m so stressed all the time. Work is just...it's not good. Passed over for another promotion...starting to wonder if I'm even in the right field.
CHAD (honest) Life's a storm, buddy. But remember, every storm passes. You just gotta stay afloat till then.
LINDA (supportive) And we're here to throw you a life jacket when you need it.
Kevin nods, a melancholic smile on his face. His glance says it all, relief and gratitude mixed in.
KEVIN (grateful) Thank you guys for helping me tonight. I know we’re gonna find him. I can feel it...
CHAD (hesitant) I once lost everything on a blackjack table. Job, house, friends...
Kevin's eyes widen in disbelief.
LINDA (normal, calm) Try investing all your savings into a pet grooming business. Spoiler: They all ran away.
Chad raises an eyebrow, undeterred.
CHAD (honest) Unidentified disease. Three doctors, zero answers.
LINDA (deadpan) Had a boyfriend. Turned out to be a con artist. Left me with debts... and a chihuahua.
CHAD (honest) Got blind for three days after an unfortunate run-in with a lemon.
LINDA (calm) Got dehydrated after drinking a Diet Coke. Figure that one out.
CHAD (awkward) Infected... after an adult circumcision.
LINDA (honest) Got abducted in a foreign country and used as a drug mule.
Kevin's eyes dart between Chad and Linda, aghast.
CHAD (sarcastic) I once owned a timeshare in Florida. Never been there once.
LINDA (normal) I'm allergic to all medicines. Even the placebo ones!
CHAD (sad) I lost my family. Boating accident... and guess who was at the helm?
Kevin stares at Chad, eyes wide, his breath hitching.
LINDA (hysterically) Try being left at the altar! By your own half-brother!
write the following into FDX: All of a sudden, his stomach starts to grumble. So do Chad's and Linda's. At that moment, Linda's eyes widen in alarm. "Oh no," she exclaims. "Did you guys eat any tofu or tempeh? That's the one thing you should never mix with those 9/11 pills I gave you!" Kevin and Chad glance at each other, realizing they did eat tofu earlier. Uh oh. Her stomach is growling too. They ask her why she ate vegan food with the 9/11 pills. She says: I just can't support the way animals are treated in the food industry anymore. Kevin, Chad, and Linda realize they need to find a bathroom fast and make a beeline for the nearest portapotties. They arrive to find a long line of people waiting, shifting from foot to foot, clearly desperate. The three of them join the line, their faces contorted with discomfort as they try to hold on for as long as possible. They exchange nervous glances, each silently hoping that they'll make it to the front of the line before disaster
