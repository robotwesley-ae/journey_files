 accuracy of Linda's codes and has his own codes. They should be arguing back and forth between them, until Chad refuses to use the codes and Linda says "fine, give me my walkie's back" Kevin "needing the help" calms them both down and just convinces them to not use any codes. That they can just talk.

EXT. FESTIVAL GROUNDS - ROLLING LOUD VENUE - NIGHT
Kevin, Linda, and Chad, high on cocaine, stand in a circle. Linda holds her walkie-talkie, eager to use the codes she presented earlier. Chad crosses his arms, clearly disagreeing with Linda's interpretations.
LINDA (excitedly) Okay, guys, listen up. We'll be using code 10-4 to indicate that we understand and acknowledge a message. If we hear code 10-13, that means we have a weather or road hazard. And if we hear code 10-20, that means we have a location update.
CHAD (skeptical) Linda, I don't think those codes are accurate. 10-4 is for a completely different purpose, and 10-13 is for police assistance, not weather hazards.
LINDA (defensive) Chad, I did my research! These codes are commonly used in various situations. Trust me, they'll help us communicate efficiently.
CHAD (dismissive) Yeah, well, I've got my own set of codes that are more accurate. 10-4 means "affirmative," 10-13 is for "getting food," and 10-20 is simply "meeting up."
LINDA (angry) Chad, your codes make no sense! We need a standardized system to ensure effective communication.
CHAD (irritated) Linda, your codes are outdated and confusing. We need codes that align with the festival's vibe.
LINDA (frustrated) Fine, Chad! If you're not going to use the codes I presented, then give me my walkie-talkie back.
Linda reaches out her hand, ready to retrieve her walkie-talkie from Chad, but Kevin steps in, realizing the need for cooperation.
KEVIN (calmly) Hey, guys, we need to work together here. We're all trying to find Zion, remember? Let's take a step back and think about what's most important.
Linda and Chad exchange a wary look, their arguments momentarily halted by Kevin's reasoning.
KEVIN (cont'd) Using these codes seems to be causing more confusion than clarity. Maybe we don't need them. We can simply talk and rely on our intuition to navigate the festival.
LINDA (reluctant) But Kevin, the codes were meant to help us communicate efficiently.
CHAD (agrees) He's right, Linda. Let's ditch the codes and focus on finding Zion. We can trust our instincts and talk to people directly.
Kevin's suggestion begins to sink in, and Linda and Chad slowly start to calm down, their high-induced tension dissipating.
KEVIN (sincerely) We're a team, guys. Let's support each other, keep a clear mind, and find Zion together. No codes, just open communication.
LINDA (relenting) You're right, Kevin. Let's put our focus on finding Zion and trust that we can navigate this festival without the codes.
CHAD (nods) Agreed. Let's do this together, as a team.
With a newfound understanding, the three of them set off into the pulsating crowd, leaving the codes and their previous arguments behind. United in purpose, they embrace the power of open communication and their shared determination to find Zion.

LINDA The codes were meant to help us communicate efficiently! CHAD (skeptical) 10-13 is for police assistance, not weather hazards. LINDA (defensive) I took a class! CHAD (dismissive) Yeah, well, your teacher was an idiot, because 10-4 means "affirmative," 10-13 is for "getting food," and 10-20 is simply "meeting up." LINDA My teacher was a very nice lady! / expand on the last line. Go into detail about Linda's teacher and how nice she was
