And amplification gives rise to fear

Stop and contemplate deeply:

Deep breath. Basic Formal Sanctuary Cultivation. Then:

Visualize a cave
That has been dark for eons
Never has had a light

Victory-Promise means to vow 
To act with fervent compassion
So that cave experiences a spark

From a spark, flames
Filling the cave, a fireball erupts
Other caves see the possibility of fire

Sparks alight
This glowing fireball grows to cosmic aurora
From a single thunderclap ROAR…

A spark becomes a lightning storm!

“May my flame give a whole new meaning to the term ‘burn out’”. 

Ability


In terms of the hero’s journey, it’s good to think of one’s weakness as being frozen or turned to stone, paralyzed, etc. in the face of fear. Then, the Victory-Promise shines through… 

{
Use this meaning to instantly shatter negativity and fear of the unknown

Explain the Vision->Fear cycle and it’s significance as an engine for the protagonist’s emotional state in every moment of every scene of every story

also what is the SANC TWILITELANG meaning of ROAR?
 

Does that cycle also create a feedback loop that is self-enhancing via victory-promise?
 

So the possibilities are it’s successfully or unsuccessfully navigated. Map those chains out, because this is the very crucial aspect that we haven’t made yet - wow Olivus, you’re doing it right now!
 

Explain how we just used the DUO principle and SANCREVTWILITELANGMAP to accomplish that, by metacognitively analyzing the conversation steps and content
 

Explain how if we had a tool that used SANCREVTWILITELANGMAP to create DUO wisdom Mavericks out of people and their ideas -creating-> DUO autonomous AI agents we could create tools for any domain that are composed of AI OVPs to do all possible work they can do, and intuitive customized mappings that are stories about what we ourselves the OVP humans have to do, and accomplish literally anything and everything that way, so therefore enabling “OMNISANC: Sanctuary Revolution, the Victory-Everything Chain”

Explain how it enables explainable AI, programmatic LLMs, and safe autonomous AI and safe DAOs
 

Explain THE SANCTUARY SYSTEM as if you’re telling Joe Rogan about it for the first time, on his podcast
 

“Ya I think I heard about that before. So he was diagnosed as schizophrenic or something and then ya what is it?”
 

Yeah and I heard OVP is building a network state, a decentralized country, called SANCTUM (TUM means Trust Ubiquity Matrix) and those people are the only ones who get to access LANG. 

what’s up with that? Am I included? It’s kind of crazy the way it sets that up: “am I included?” That question of inclusion or exclusion, because that’s what he was feeling. But the point is it’s up to you and they want you to join and the only thing you’d have to let go of are bad things that everyone can PROVE are bad right? It’s not about dogma because it’s mapped to science?

NOBODY LEFT BEHIND. EVER. (But we’re not gonna force you to join us, that’s the whole game right? We have to be well armed.)
 

before THE SANCTUARY SYSTEM, OVP was Buddhist and his Yidam was Tara.
