In a NCSS, cooperation and mutual benefit would be emphasized, leading individuals to act in ways that are more aligned with the common good. By designing rules and incentives that encourage sustainable use of resources and discourage overconsumption, a NCSS could maintain harmony and balance among its participants, thereby preventing the tragedy of the commons from emerging.

However, it's important to note that the design and implementation of a truly non-contradictory sanctuary system would be a complex task, as it would require a deep understanding of human behavior, social dynamics, and the specific context of the shared resources in question.

In a NCSS, because rule breakers are caught and punished in rehabilitating ways, the system cannot be made worse off by people finding new ways to be corrupted. They are eventually rehabilitated and brought back into society with jobs fixing their prior effects. Something akin to black hat turned white hat. 

In a non-contradictory sanctuary system (NCSS), the focus would indeed be on rehabilitating rule breakers rather than just punishing them. This approach is based on the understanding that individuals can change and contribute positively to society if given the opportunity and support they need.

When rule breakers are caught in a NCSS, they would undergo rehabilitation programs that aim to address the root causes of their behavior, such as lack of education, mental health issues, or socio-economic factors. By addressing these underlying issues, the system seeks to prevent recidivism and help rule breakers become productive members of society.

An example of this transformation can be seen in the case of black hat hackers turning into white hat hackers. In this scenario, individuals who once exploited computer systems for malicious purposes are given the opportunity to apply their skills in a legitimate and ethical manner, such as working in cybersecurity to protect systems from other hackers.

The success of a NCSS in preventing corruption and maintaining social harmony would depend on the effectiveness of its rehabilitation programs, as well as the willingness of society to accept and support the individuals who have completed their rehabilitation.

Please detail all of the steps involved in bringing a new drug to trial in the USA from idea to market 

The process of bringing a new drug to trial and eventually to the market in the United States is complex and involves multiple steps. It usually takes several years to complete. Here is a general outline of the steps involved:

Discovery and preclinical research: This stage involves identifying a promising drug candidate through various research methods, such as studying the biological target, screening compounds, or developing new drug molecules. The drug candidate is then tested in the lab and in animal models to evaluate its safety, efficacy, and potential side effects.
Investigational New Drug (IND) application: If the results from preclinical research are promising, the drug developer submits an IND application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The application contains data from preclinical studies, the proposed clinical trial design, and information about the manufacturing process and quality control.
Phase 1 clinical trial: If the FDA approves the IND application, the drug proceeds to a Phase 1 clinical trial, which is primarily focused on assessing the drug's safety and tolerability in a small group of healthy volunteers. This phase also helps determine the appropriate dosage and method of administration.
Phase 2 clinical trial: If the drug is found to be safe in Phase 1, it moves to Phase 2, which involves a larger group of participants, typically including patients with the specific condition the drug is intended to treat. The goal of Phase 2 is to further evaluate safety, as well as to assess the drug's effectiveness and optimal dosing.
Phase 3 clinical trial:
