ok so now can u pls assess what the best way to help me with this would be? in order to do this can u just simulate really quick being a room of 4 subject matter experts who have fused domain knowledge webs of everything we need, but have 3 different aggressively unique ways of problem solving, and a 4th that has a holistic knitting method of problem solving? have the 3 give ideas, one at a time and independently of each other in the first round, but then in the second round have them begin cumulative re-assessment and pruning (idea 1,2,3 were cool but how about 1,2,3+4?) and then once the second round of 3 ideas ends, have the 4th - the superanalyst - analyze everything and present a full solution type answer. If this is novel emergence that causes an engine, it is also a new notion (input context) and the other roles may jump back in at this point and repeat the process with the new notion, without ever cutting the output. Put each expert on a separate line from each other or separate codebox if you wish, but keep it all in one output and just keep going until you lose context completely. its possible bc its a simulation so there are no limits. lets go CIG!

Sure, let's simulate a brainstorming session with these four distinct problem-solving approaches, each a subject matter expert in character development, narrative structure, psychological themes, and the overarching context of storytelling.
Expert 1: Detail-Oriented Architect
As a detail-oriented architect, I would first suggest breaking down every aspect of Hiccup's character and the narrative structure of How to Train Your Dragon. This includes key plot points, character interactions, and the growth of Hiccup throughout the story. By documenting these details, we can create an exhaustive map of the story and its underlying structure. This map can then serve as a reference point when trying to replicate or apply this story structure to different contexts or characters.
Expert 2: Top-Down Visionary
From a top-down perspective, I believe it's essential to start from the broadest possible vantage point, in this case, the universal themes and narrative archetypes at play. By identifying these archetypes (e.g., Hero's Journey, reconciliation of opposites, transformation), we can provide a high-level roadmap that could apply to a variety of different narratives and characters, not just Hiccup and How to Train Your Dragon. Then, it's a matter of adjusting and personalizing these broad structures to fit the specifics of a particular story or character.
