 emergent structure would be a systematic exploration of all classes at each abstraction layer before moving to the next layer.
Expert 2 (Computational Ontology):
The relationship between instance properties and class properties is a fundamental part of ontology design. In EWSO, this relationship is characterized by the dynamism of emergent structures. When we talk about the distance between an instance property and a class property, we're talking about the number of ontological layers that separate the two.
The direct class parent of an instance is the closest class that this instance is part of. This class encapsulates the properties that this instance and other instances in the same class have in common. The process of abstraction involves moving up these classes towards broader and more generalized classes, each of which encapsulates more instances.
As we abstract, we ascend in the ontological structure, and each step takes us closer to the superclass. To prevent skipping superclasses in this emergent web structure, the algorithm should be designed to traverse each class and its immediate superclass before moving on to the next level of superclasses. This ensures that every superclass at each level is visited before moving on to the next level.
Expert 3 (Mathematical Ontology):
In EWSO, the relationship between instance properties and class properties is captured in the form of an emergent hierarchical structure. This structure characterizes the instance-class relationship in a multi-level manner, wherein each level represents a class or a superclass.
The direct class parent of an instance is the class that directly includes the instance, i.e., the class that is defined by the shared properties of its instances. As we move from instance properties to class properties, we perform a process of abstraction wherein specific instance properties are generalized into class properties.
This abstraction forms an ontological structure that ascends from specific instances to broader classes and then to even broader superclasses. To ensure no superclass is skipped in this structure, the algorithm needs to iteratively traverse through each class at a given level before proceeding to the next level, systematically exploring every superclass at each stage.
Expert 4 (Cognitive Science):
From a cognitive perspective, the relationship between instance properties and class properties forms an emergent web structure in EWSO. This structure represents the cognitive process of categorization, where specific instances with shared properties are grouped into classes, and these classes, in turn, are grouped into broader superclasses based on shared class properties.
The direct class parent of an instance is the closest cognitive category that the instance belongs to. This category is formed by the shared properties of its instances. The process of moving from instance properties to class properties represents a process of cognitive abstraction, where specific features are generalized to form broader categories.
This process creates a hierarchical cognitive structure, ascending from specific instances to broader classes and superclasses. An algorithm for not skipping superclasses in this structure would involve a systematic cognitive traversal through each class and its immediate superclass before moving to the next level. This ensures that the cognitive structure accurately reflects the ontological structure, capturing all levels of abstraction.

IN EACH OUTPUT there will be: 
Four experts and 2+ discussion rounds 
Round 1:
Expert 1 formulates their response
Expert 2 formulates their response
Expert 3 formulates their response
Expert 4 combines the three, prunes and iteratively refines the best and most promising ideas, diving deep like a submarine pinging its radar for incorrectness and illogical applications, making sure to bring up any contradictions and skeptical uncertainty, making everyone aware of it, bringing everything  back to reality 

Round 2:
