While there is evidence that KOR activation can modulate the release of other neurotransmitters, it is important to note that the exact mechanisms and consequences of these interactions are still being investigated. More research is needed to fully understand how KOR activation might reset or alter the regulation of neurotransmitter systems and whether these changes have therapeutic potential.

What does KOR seem most strongly related to? Memories? 

Kappa opioid receptors (KORs) are not directly related to memory formation or retrieval. However, they do play a role in modulating various brain functions that can indirectly influence memory and cognitive processes. KORs are most strongly related to the regulation of mood, stress responses, and the perception of pain.

KOR activation has been shown to produce dysphoric and stress-like effects in both animals and humans. This is because KOR activation can modulate the release of various neurotransmitters, such as dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine, which are involved in mood regulation, stress responses, and reward processing.

In terms of memory and cognition, KOR activation might influence these processes indirectly through its effects on stress and mood. For instance, chronic stress and dysphoria can impair memory and cognitive function, and KOR activation might contribute to these impairments. However, the relationship between KOR activation and memory is not as direct or well-established as its relationship with mood and stress.

Furthermore, some studies have suggested that KOR agonists, like Salvinorin A, can produce hallucinogenic effects, which might temporarily alter perception, cognition, and memory. However, these effects are not well-understood and require further research to determine their precise mechanisms and potential therapeutic applications.

There are extreme examples of psychic pain where people report the same types of dissociative experiences associated with KOR activation 

Psychic pain, or emotional pain, can indeed lead to dissociative experiences in some individuals. Dissociation is a psychological phenomenon that can manifest in various forms, such as depersonalization (feeling detached from one's own body or self) and derealization (feeling that the external world is unreal). These experiences can be triggered by intense emotional pain, trauma, or stress, and they may serve as a coping mechanism to help the individual distance themselves from the overwhelming emotional distress.

Kappa opioid receptor (KOR) activation has been linked to dissociative effects as well. Some KOR agonists, such as the hallucinogen Salvinorin A, can induce dissociative states that share similarities with those experienced during intense psychic pain. However, the relationship between KOR activation and dissociation is complex and not yet fully understood.

While there is some overlap between the dissociative experiences associated with psychic pain and KOR activation, it is essential to recognize that they might arise from different mechanisms and have distinct implications for mental health and treatment. Further research is needed to better understand the relationship between KOR activation, dissociative experiences, and psychic pain, as well as to explore the potential therapeutic applications of KOR-targeting drugs in the treatment of emotional pain and related conditions.

I mean fully dissociative effects like the perception of the world collapsing and the perception of all other beings in the world, things people describe with ketamine and salvinorin A

Both ketamine and Salvinorin A can induce intense dissociative effects, including the perception of the world collapsing or experiencing an altered sense of reality involving other beings. These powerful dissociative experiences can be quite different from the dissociative states that arise due to psychic pain, trauma, or stress.
