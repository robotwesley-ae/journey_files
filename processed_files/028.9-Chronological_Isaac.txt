 that stuff like “this is what happens when you die and it must all be chemically related and everyone must be talking about this all the time but its just complicated” studied a little bit of the neuroscience of DMT… read more about neuroscience and tibetan book of the dead and felt like i didnt understand that so i went back to the shambhala stuff. I didnt get involved with them but i took everything to heart as like “this is the actual (must be the actual) technique”.

I remember when christina broke up with me I was so devastated and i curled up with my cat and was crying and then started thinking about how she was only doing this because she was forgetting what its like when were together because were growing in different ways but i wish she would grow with me… just each growing however, together. Spontaneously i started putting together all these things like “oh my god theres no way to help people see love if tgey dont live thesmelves and theres no way for them to love themselves if other people are constantly torturing themselves because they also want to be loved but dont love themselves a” and this is just like an infinite soup of how do you break out because how do you love yourself when you dont know ho you are and if nobody knows who they are unless they love themself… ok
