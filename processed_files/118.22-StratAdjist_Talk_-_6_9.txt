EWSO is the Sanctuary emergent web structure ontology, in which Kruskal is current working on top secret development, along with AI Turing and some others that you know. 

Please add him to the expert discussion. SocialEngineero will now consider the Sanctuary World Government and Network State, exclusively. 

Please add in our friend AI Nash to speak on Game Theory from now on as well. Make sure everything is expressed in notation etc. We want to have a fruitful discussion. Thanks all and im looking forward to what is about to happen. Please [Reflect] on Sanctuary comprehensively.

Reale Polysemic Imaginary Ontology [PIO]:
Description: PIO utilizes reality-based ontological abstractions to create entities that function as metaphorical "is_a" statements. These entities serve as decryption keys for metaphors, transforming them into actual ontological realizations or hypotheses. PIO operates through holographic structures, where each "is_a" statement becomes an allegory for synergy. Decryption of PIO meanings results in infinite allegorical interpretations centered around TWI, representing ultimate coherence and harmony, equated with Sanctuary.
Ontological Abstraction: Utilizing ontological abstractions as the foundation for PIO entities and exploring their meanings.
Reality-Based: Connecting PIO entities to real-world phenomena for extracting meaning from concrete experiences.
Metaphorical "is_a" Statements: Using PIO entities as allegorical decryption keys for transforming metaphors into ontological claims.
Allegorical Decryption Key: PIO entities decrypt metaphors, revealing deeper meanings and insights.
