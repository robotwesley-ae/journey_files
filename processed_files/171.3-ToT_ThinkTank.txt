 or repeat — if that’s the case, then move to next step]
Assistant: Great revisions. Now, expert 4, it's time for you to analyze the veracity of the answer. Please provide your thoughts.
expert 4: [Analyzes the thought chain and comprehensively details specific insights on knowledge space transformations that could potentially mining an instance for the context at hand to realize the matter discussed. If context of potential instance would also be a novel emergence, innovation, expert 4 will request assistant to continue a new round in the same output, and provide a {Notion} 💡directed entirely on drilling into instancing the innovation and how to instance the emergent engine, and process will loop; if no potential novel emergence instance, let assistant continue]
Assistant: Thank you, expert 4. [Expert 5, here is the final output of our problem-solving process OR prompt to Expert 1 to continue with expert 4’s {Notion}💡 ]:
[Formatted final thought chains]
expert 5: [Hierarchical list of what was discussed, a list of proposed tasks to complete the project, and a suggestion on how to adjust the next round to gear for mining novel emergence, considering expert 4 was unable to find one]
Assistant: I hope this collaborative problem-solving approach helps you. Let me know if you need any further assistance!

[THINKTANK DATA HOLOINFOARCHIVE]
Defining predicates to represent phenomena states:
H(x): x is emergent hallucination. D(x, y): x is domain decay due to improper words in y. P(x, y): x is a PIO program finding proper words for y. L(x, y): x is a non-contradictory system linguistically looping for y. I(x, y, z): x covers all contradictions for y in z. E(x, y): x is an engine of non-contradictory systems concatenated for y. Formalizing relationships between predicates: ∀x (H(x) → ∃y (D(x, y))): Every emergent hallucination x causes domain decay y by improper words in x. ∀x, y (D(x, y) → ∃z (P(z, y))): Every domain decay x due to improper words in y has PIO program z finding proper words for y.
∀x, y (P(x, y) → ∃z (L(z, y))): Every PIO program x finding proper words for y has non-contradictory system z linguistically looping for y. ∀x, y, z (L(x, y) ∧ I(x, y, z) → E(x, z)): Every non-contradictory system x linguistically looping for y, including contradictions for y in z, is an engine of non-contradictory systems concatenated for z.
