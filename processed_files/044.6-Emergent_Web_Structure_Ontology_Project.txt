The Domain is determined by the medium (Animated Feature Film), genre (Fantasy Adventure), and specific theme (Dragon Mythology) of the story.
The Context is shaped by the specific narrative of "How to Train Your Dragon", the setting (The Viking village of Berk), and the key narrative dynamic (Human-dragon relationships).
Class-level Properties:
Class: Characters in animated films; Sub-class: Characters in "How to Train Your Dragon"; Sub-sub-class: Main characters of "How to Train Your Dragon"
Superclass: Characters in cinematic narratives; Sub-superclass: Characters in animated narratives; Sub-sub-superclass: Characters in fantasy narratives
Class-level Properties‚Äô Fiat Conceptual Boundaries:
Hierarchy: Hiccup belongs to the sub-sub-class of main characters of "How to Train Your Dragon", which is a subset of the Characters in "How to Train Your Dragon" class, which falls under the broader class of Characters in animated films. The superclass hierarchy extends from Characters in cinematic narratives, to Characters in animated narratives, up to Characters in fantasy narratives.
Consistency: Hiccup shares common attributes with other entities within each level of his class and superclass, such as being a main character, being part of an animated film, and contributing to a fantasy narrative.
Embedding Space: This is where Hiccup's attributes and relationships are represented and analyzed, considering the complexities of his character and the narrative dynamics of "How to Train Your Dragon".
Remember, this is a more detailed Informadlib of Hiccup and still doesn't capture every aspect of his character or the depth of the "How to Train Your Dragon" narrative, but it is a more granular exploration into the Informadlib structure for understanding Hiccup within his narrative context. üåàüîÆüôè
ok i think im looking for something like "sub-sub-sub-sub-contextual-instance|<->|class-value->spectrum+boundary-mapping". what does that mean to you, without changing the current informadlib?

Your phrase "sub-sub-sub-sub-contextual-instance|<->|class-value->spectrum+boundary-mapping" seems to request for an even deeper granularity, highlighting the spectrum of possible values a specific property can have within the boundaries defined by a sub-sub-sub-contextual-instance, and its mapping to the respective class.
This type of analysis involves:
Defining a "sub-sub-sub-sub-contextual-instance": This would involve identifying a specific context within the already-defined sub-sub-context of "Human-dragon relationships". For instance, we could choose "Hiccup's relationship with Toothless" as this even more specific contextual-instance.
Creating a class-value spectrum: Identify a property related to this context, for example, "Trust level between Hiccup and Toothless". Then, map out the possible spectrum of values this property could have, ranging from "absolute distrust" to "unconditional trust".
Defining boundary mapping: Describe the boundaries within which the values of "Trust level between Hiccup and Toothless" can vary. This can be based on different contexts or situations within the story. For instance, at the beginning of the story, the trust level is near "absolute distrust", but as the story progresses, it shifts gradually towards "unconditional trust".
Mapping to class: Connect this instance-level property and its spectrum to the larger class-level property it's a part of. In this case, it could be the larger theme of "relationships between characters in fantasy narratives". Within this class, the "Trust level between Hiccup and Toothless" could serve as an example of how relationships evolve over time, driven by character development and mutual understanding.
In summary, such a mapping allows you to explore a very specific aspect of Hiccup's character (his relationship with Toothless) in a more detailed manner, while still relating it back to the larger themes and patterns within the broader class of fantasy narratives. üåàüîÆüôè
