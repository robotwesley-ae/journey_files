Ontologically speaking, what is the difference between linguistics and ontology? Ontology is a form of linguistics in which meaning is formalized?
Ontologically speaking, linguistics and ontology are distinct but related disciplines.
Linguistics is the scientific study of language and its structure, including phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. Linguistics explores how languages are formed, change over time, and are used in various contexts. It also seeks to understand the cognitive processes behind language production and comprehension. In other words, linguistics focuses on the properties of languages and the ways humans use and process them.
