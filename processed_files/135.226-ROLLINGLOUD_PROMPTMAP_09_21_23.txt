SECURITY GUARD 1 (disapproving) You knowingly provided false information, putting your child at risk. That's a violation of Section 273a of the Penal Code. Do you realize the consequences?
SECURITY GUARD 2 (threateningly) I should call child protective services on you right now!
Kevin tries to reason with them, his voice tinged with desperation.
KEVIN (defensive) I didn't realize there was an age restriction. I just wanted to bond with my son, to give him a memorable experience. I never meant to put him in danger.
The security guards remain unmoved, their authority resolute. Just as they move to handcuff Kevin, the atmosphere becomes charged with tension.
Suddenly, Chad bursts into the room, holding a fire extinguisher like a weapon. His entrance catches everyone off guard.
CHAD (determined) Step back! Nobody's cuffing my buddy Kevin!
Without waiting for a response, Chad pulls the pin on the fire extinguisher and sprays its contents in every direction, creating a thick cloud of white foam. The security guards are momentarily blinded and disoriented, stumbling back as they try to shield their faces.
In the midst of the chaos, Kevin feels a strong grip on his arm. He looks over to see Chad, grinning wildly.
CHAD (excitedly) Come on, let's get out of here!
As Chad leads the way, he continues to spray the fire extinguisher, accidentally dousing Kevin in foam as well. They run, leaving the disoriented security guards behind in a room filled with foam. Kevin's mind races with worry about Zion and the consequences of their escape.
They continue running, both covered in fire extinguisher powder, trying to put as much distance as possible between themselves and the security guards, their hearts pounding with a mix of fear and determination.

EXT. SECURITY TENT - ROLLING LOUD VENUE - NIGHT
Kevin rushes up to the receptionist, sweat dripping down his face as he frantically explains that his son is missing. The receptionist, a young woman with a calm demeanor, listens attentively as she begins taking down the report.
KEVIN (out of breath) Excuse me, I need help! My son is missing. I can't find him anywhere!
RECEPTIONIST (concerned) Okay, sir. Please calm down. I'm here to help. Can you provide me with some information? What's your son's name?
KEVIN (panicked) His name is Zion. He's thirteen years old. He was with me earlier, but I lost sight of him in the crowd.
The receptionist's fingers fly over the keyboard as she takes down the details.
RECEPTIONIST (nodding) Got it. Can you give me a physical description of your son?
KEVIN (describing) He's about 5'5", brown hair, wearing a black Rolling Loud t-shirt and blue jeans. Please, we need to find him.
Just as Kevin is about to provide more details, the security guard who had initially rejected them bursts into the room, his expression incredulous as he spots Kevin.
SECURITY GUARD (surprised) Hey, aren't you the guy who tried to sneak in earlier?
The receptionist looks up, momentarily distracted by the commotion.
RECEPTIONIST (trying to maintain order) Sir, please wait your turn. I'm assisting this gentleman with a missing child report.
The security guard's gaze shifts from the receptionist to Kevin, his suspicion growing.
SECURITY GUARD (doubtful) What's going on here? Is there something you're not telling us?
Kevin's face turns red with embarrassment, realizing he's caught in a lie. He takes a deep breath, mustering the courage to come clean.
KEVIN (admitting) You're right. I lied earlier. My son is actually thirteen. I just wanted to give him a chance to experience this festival.
The security guard's expression hardens, his tone stern.
SECURITY GUARD (disapproving) Lying to gain entry to the festival and putting your child at risk is not acceptable. We take these matters seriously.
The receptionist interjects, trying to defuse the tension.
