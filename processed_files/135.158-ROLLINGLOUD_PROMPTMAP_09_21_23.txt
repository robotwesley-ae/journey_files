Stranded Situation: Kevin, Chad, and Linda are trapped in a pod at the very top of a Ferris wheel during the Rolling Loud Festival. As hours seem to stretch indefinitely and there's no rescue in sight, the urgency of their predicament becomes palpably clear.
Initial Assessment: Surveying their surroundings, Linda identifies an adjacent pod sitting slightly lower than theirs. Chad, recalling his climbing experiences, theorizes they could jump to this pod as an initial step towards safety. Kevin, though cautious and concerned about the potential risks, recognizes the pressing nature of their circumstances.
The Daring Leap: Summoning his courage, Chad edges closer to the rim of their pod, mentally gauges the distance to the neighboring pod, and takes a calculated jump, landing safely. He motions for Kevin and Linda to do the same.
Linda's attempt is fraught with danger. Her jump is imperfect, causing her clothing to snag on their original pod, leaving her dangling perilously between the two. Kevin immediately reaches out, securing Linda's ankles, while Chad extends his arms from the adjacent pod, gripping her wrists. Their combined shouts of distress intermingle with Linda's horrified screams. The tension escalates when Linda's clothing tears, sending her cascading onto a beam several feet below, where she clings for dear life.
