Melinda and Chad are amazed by Mushroom Marie's unconventional method of breaking the lock. They follow her out of the jail and onto the festival grounds, where they try to blend in with the crowds to avoid the security guards.
As they wander through the festival, they come across a group of street performers. Mushroom Marie recognizes one of them and introduces him as her friend, "Magic Mike." Melinda and Chad are skeptical at first, but Mushroom Marie insists that Magic Mike can help them get to the main stage.

Perhaps during their time on the Playbus, Playboi Carti gets a call that he's needed on stage as a surprise guest for a major act. Playboi is hesitant to leave his bus unattended, but Kevin offers to stay behind and keep an eye on things for him.
While Playboi rushes off to the main stage, Kevin finds himself alone on the bus with Shenseea. As they wait for Playboi's return, they start to bond over their shared experiences and love of music. Shenseea opens up to Kevin, telling him about her own struggles as a rising artist in the industry.
As they talk, Kevin starts to see things in a new light. He realizes that his fears for Zion's safety have been holding him back from truly enjoying the festival and the experiences it has to offer. He starts to let go of his anxieties and immerses himself in the music and the moment.
Just as Kevin is starting to feel like things are looking up, they hear a commotion outside the bus. Security guards are pounding on the door, demanding that they let them in.
Kevin and Shenseea panic, not sure what to do. But then Kevin has an idea - he grabs a mic and starts beatboxing, while Shenseea starts freestyling over the top.
The guards are taken aback by the sudden burst of music, and before they know it, a crowd of festival-goers has gathered outside the bus, dancing and cheering along. Kevin and Shenseea's impromptu performance becomes a viral sensation, and they're invited to perform on the main stage as Playboi's surprise guests.
With newfound confidence and a renewed sense of purpose, Kevin and Shenseea take to the stage and deliver a showstopping performance that leaves the crowd begging for more. And in the midst of it all, Kevin spots Zion in the audience, laughing and dancing along with the rest of the crowd.
Kevin and Zion share a moment of recognition, and Kevin realizes that his son is growing up and becoming his own person. He can't hold him back forever, and it's time to start trusting him to make his own choices.
In the end, Kevin, Shenseea, and Zion dance the night away, surrounded by the music and the magic of the festival. They may have come to find Zion, but they leave with so much more - a newfound sense of freedom, and a bond that can never be broken.
