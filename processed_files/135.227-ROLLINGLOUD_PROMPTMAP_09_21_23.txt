RECEPTIONIST (gently) Let's focus on finding the child first. We can address the other issues later.
The security guard nods reluctantly, realizing the urgency of the situation.
SECURITY GUARD (to receptionist) Please continue taking the report. I'll keep an eye out for the missing child.
The receptionist resumes her task, her fingers flying over the keyboard once more. Kevin's heart pounds with worry as he watches, hoping that they can locate Zion as quickly as possible.

EXT. SECURITY TENT - ROLLING LOUD VENUE - NIGHT Kevin rushes up to the receptionist, sweat dripping. KEVIN (out of breath) Excuse me, ma'am! I need your help. My son is missing. The receptionist, a young woman with a calm demeanor, listens attentively as she begins taking down the report. RECEPTIONIST (concerned) Okay, sir. Please calm down. KEVIN We were at the festival, and I turned around for just a moment, and he's gone. I've been searching everywhere, but I can't find him. The receptionist's fingers fly over the keyboard as she starts documenting the information. RECEPTIONIST What's your son's name? KEVIN (panicked) His name is Zion. He's thirteen. RECEPTIONIST (eyes him sternly) You need to be sixteen. KEVIN I know, but... Just as Kevin is about to answer, the SECURITY GUARD who let them in spots Kevin. SECURITY GUARD 1 Hey, you told me your son was sixteen. Feeling the pressure, Kevin decides to stick to his lie. KEVIN Um...he is. He is sixteen. However the FIRST SECURITY GUARD appears. SECURITY GUARD 2 (angry) Hold on a minute! I distinctly remember you telling me your son was 13 earlier. RECEPTIONIST What’s going on here, sir? Kevin's face turns red with embarrassment, realizing he's caught in a lie. He takes a deep breath -- KEVIN (admitting) You're right. My son is actually 13. I... I lied. I'm sorry. The security guards exchange a disapproving look, their skepticism evident. SECURITY GUARD 1 (disapproving) You knowingly provided false information, putting your child at risk. That's a violation of Section 273a of the Penal Code. Do you realize the consequences? SECURITY GUARD 2 (threateningly) I should call child protective services on you right now! KEVIN (losing defensive) I didn't realize there was an age restriction. SECURITY GUARD 1 Calm down, sir. KEVIN I’m calm. I just wanted to bond with my son, I never meant to put him in danger. The security guards remain unmoved, their authority resolute. Just as they move to handcuff Kevin, the atmosphere becomes charged with tension.

CHAD bursts into the room, holding a fire extinguisher like a weapon.
CHAD (firmly) Step back! Nobody's cuffing my buddy Kevin!
The security guards freeze in their tracks, taken aback by Chad's sudden entrance and the determination in his voice. They exchange wary glances.
SECURITY GUARD 1 (hesitant) Put that down, sir. We're just following protocol.
Without waiting for a response, Chad pulls the pin on the fire extinguisher and sprays its contents in every direction, creating a thick cloud of white foam. The security guards are momentarily blinded and disoriented, stumbling back as they try to shield their faces.
In the midst of the chaos, Kevin feels a strong grip on his arm. He looks over to see Chad, grinning wildly.
CHAD (excitedly) Come on, let's get out of here!
As Chad leads the way, he continues to
