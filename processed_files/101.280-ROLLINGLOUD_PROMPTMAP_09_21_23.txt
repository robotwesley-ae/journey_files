They must hop from one pod to another, encountering eccentric festival-goers along the way.
They form a human chain, trying to hold onto each other as they descend. Of course, someone slips.
The scene takes on a "Cliffhanger" vibe as they navigate the Ferris wheel, intoxicated and in the midst of the Rolling Loud chaos.

THE FERRIS WHEEL GRINDS TO A HALT They find themselves stranded at the very top of the Ferris wheel, the night sky a canopy above them. KEVIN What the fuck just happened?

Meanwhile, a massive mosh pit is forming in front of the stage. KEVIN Zion! //// learn the above scene, but I want to continue the scene by expanding on the following, with 10 suggested possible beats: As the scene unfolds, Kevin, Linda, and Chad, all high and slightly panicked, attempt to make their way down from the Ferris wheel's pinnacle. Several wild scenarios play out: They must hop from one pod to another, encountering eccentric festival-goers along the way. They form a human chain, trying to hold onto each other as they descend.

EXT. FERRIS WHEEL - NIGHT
As the Ferris wheel grinds to a halt, Kevin, Chad, and Linda find themselves stuck at its peak, the night sky stretching endlessly above.
KEVIN (disbelief) What the heck just happened?
CHAD (nervous) Did it run out of power?
LINDA (excited) No, there's power. Look down there! A wheelchair guy! And another one... and more!
Suddenly, they notice a group of wheelchair users waiting on the platform below.
KEVIN (uneasy) Oh no...
CHAD (grinning) Wait, is it a whole wheelchair team? The U.S. Wheelchair Collegiate Team, no less.
One by one, each player wheels onto the platform, surrounding them in the cramped pod.
CHAD (laughing) They don't call it "Rolling Loud" for nothing!
KEVIN (apprehensive) This isn't good.
INT. ROLLING LOUD - MAIN STAGE - MOMENTS LATER
Travis Scott is commanding the stage, the crowd in a frenzy.
TRAVIS (yelling) Yo, I'm calling for the biggest mosh pit in history! Break some records! People need to go wild! Let's beat Astroworld! What was it, 9 casualties? We're aiming for 10!
This declaration sets a dangerous tone, the clock ticking ominously.
INT. FERRIS WHEEL POD - THE PEAK - CONTINUOUS
The situation inside the pod becomes increasingly tense.
KEVIN (desperation) We need to get down from here.
CHAD (pondering) No, I've got a better idea. Let's send Linda.
INT. FERRIS WHEEL POD - HIGH ABOVE ROLLING LOUD - CONTINUOUS
Ten possible beats:
Eccentric Encounter: They decide to hop from one pod to another, encountering eccentric festival-goers along the way. Each pod contains a new adventure. One has a guy dressed as a disco ball, another holds a group of people speaking entirely in rhymes.
A Slip of Fate: As they attempt to form a human chain, trying to hold onto each other as they descend, Linda loses her grip. Panic ensues as she dangles precariously, screaming for help.
The Balancing Act: Kevin, Chad, and Linda must balance precariously on the Ferris wheel's framework. The wind howls, and their intoxicated state makes it a harrowing experience.
