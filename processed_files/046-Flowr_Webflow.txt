Do people send to friends if they make money vs if it’s just a good deal? Does it matter? It matters because it’s cool, that’s why most people do things. It matters it’s a good deal so it’s not expensive to be cool unless buying the expensive thing is part of being cool (so we should have more expensive strains). But it also matters because of money.
People will buy the flower because it’s cheap and it’s good
They won’t be turned off by B buds

But the reduced potency makes them more likely not to
We should carry A buds, too
People don’t care that it’s hemp and not weed, they care what happens when they smoke it
