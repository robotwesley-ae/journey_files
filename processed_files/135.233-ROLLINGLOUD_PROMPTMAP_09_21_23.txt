write the following into FDX: Chad nods solemnly, realizing the gravity of the situation. "Hi there!" the woman greets them, her voice full of enthusiasm. She wears a festival volunteer t-shirt, oversized sunglasses, and a glittery fanny pack, and hands them each a towel. "Hi there! I'm Linda," she exclaims, "The drinks are on me! Can I get you fellas something?" Without waiting for an answer, "I don't really know much about festivals, to be honest," she admits, "I was just bored and thought I'd give volunteering a shot." Chad snickers as he accepts her offer on behalf of both of them, while Kevin hesitates. As Linda prepares their drinks and hands them towels to clean themselves, she chats excitedly about the festival, consistently mispronouncing band names and demonstrating her peculiar dance moves that she's convinced are the latest trends. Handing Kevin and Chad their drinks, Linda notices the worried expression on Kevin's face. "You look like you could use some cheering up. Did you know it's a festival tradition to trade shoelaces with strangers? It's a great way to make new friends!" Chad scoffs and retorts, "Yeah, 'cause that's totally not weird at all." Linda glares at Chad before turning to Kevin. "Come on, Kevin, live a little. It's Rolling Loud, after all." Chad chimes in, "Yeah, one drink won't hurt. We're here to have fun, right?" Kevin hesitates, unsure. "I don't know." Linda and Chad try to comfort Kevin, with Linda saying, "Don't worry. Zion probably just needed some space and wanted to hang out with kids his own age without his dad." Kevin gets defensive, responding, "Zion would NEVER do something like that." Seeing that Kevin is still hesitant, Chad and Linda continue to persuade him. "Aw, come on, don't be such a party pooper," Chad taunts. Linda adds, "We're just trying to help you relax a bit. It's not every day you get to experience Rolling Loud!" Feeling the pressure, Kevin finally relents. "Okay, fine. One drink." Chad and Linda cheer, celebrating Kevin's decision. Their bickering resumes when Linda offers, "How about we take it up a notch? Shots for everyone!" She quickly pours shots for the three of them. As they down their shots, Chad, not to be outdone by Linda, pulls out a small bag of cocaine, grinning mischievously. "Hey, why not kick it up even further? It's Rolling Loud, after all." Kevin's eyes widen in shock as Chad and Linda partake in the drug. He's taken aback by the turn of events and can't believe the situation he's found himself in. All he wanted was to find his son, and now he's surrounded by debauchery that he never imagined he'd be part of. Linda casually mentions, "I took a couple of pills called '9/11' and dropped them in our shots. I don't even know what they do." In a sudden burst of anger, Kevin snaps, "What the hell is wrong with you? I'm here trying to find my lost 13-year-old son, Zion, and you're drugging our drinks?" Linda's face falls, and she looks genuinely upset. "I'm so sorry, Kevin. I didn't know. I was just trying to help you relax and have some fun." Kevin, seeing the remorse on her face, tries to calm down. "Look, I appreciate that, but my priority is finding my son." Linda nods, eager to make amends. "I understand. As a volunteer, I have some access to the festival's resources." She quickly spots a table with several walkie-talkies for the volunteers and swipes two more, handing one to Kevin and another to Chad. "Now we can all communicate with other volunteers and security. We'll find him together."
