INT. ROLLING LOUD FESTIVAL - VENDOR TENT - NIGHT
The tent flaps wave with a light breeze, the campfire throwing flickering shadows around them. Chad starts to speak, his voice eerily calm.
CHAD (hesitant) I once lost everything on a blackjack table. Job, house, friends...
Kevin's eyes widen in disbelief. He turns to Linda, who, despite the gravity of the situation, smiles wryly.
LINDA (sarcastically) Oh, yeah? Well, try investing all your savings into a pet grooming business. Spoiler: They all ran away.
Kevin, caught between shock and laughter, shakes his head. His friends are a disaster, but they're his disaster. Chad raises an eyebrow, undeterred.
CHAD (determined) Unidentified disease. Three doctors, zero answers.
Linda's laughter fades as she raises the stakes.
LINDA (deadpan) Had a boyfriend. Turned out to be a con artist. Left me with debts... and a chihuahua.
Kevin's laughter dies in his throat as he realizes the depth of his friends' past struggles.
As the night wears on, they delve into increasingly outrageous misadventures: Chad's blindness after an unfortunate run-in with a lemon, Linda's dehydration caused by an inexplicable reaction to Diet Coke, Chad's painful infection post an adult circumcision, and Linda's terrifying drug mule experience.
CHAD (low, intense) I once owned a timeshare in Florida. Never been there once.
LINDA (shaking her head) And I... I'm allergic to all medicines. Even the placebo ones!
With every word, Kevin's mind seems to race, attempting to reconcile the madness he's hearing with the friends he thought he knew. As they finish their tales, the night around them seems to hold its breath.
KEVIN (murmuring) You guys... how are you even... still here?
His voice hangs in the air, mixing with the smoke of the campfire, their shared laughter, and the unsaid resilience that binds them together.
EXPAND ON THE FOLLOWING: As the night goes on, the group continue their one-upping misery marathon. Chad with tales of gambling addiction, lost jobs, houses, and friends, not to mention his unknown disease. Linda counters with failed businesses, catastrophic relationships, and her battles with sleepwalking.

As the evening matures into night, the trio's stories continue to unfold, a bizarre marathon of tragedy that is almost comedic in its relentless one-upmanship.
Chad begins with his darker tales, each one punctuated by a humor-filled, rueful shake of his head. His stories tumble out, fragmented like pieces of a shattered mirror. Gambling - a devilish mistress that took more than his money, claiming his job, his home, and the friends he once held dear. He speaks of the rush, the thrill of risk, and the despair that followed each loss. He digs deeper, revealing an even more personal demon: an undiagnosed disease that doctors can't seem to wrap their minds around, leaving him in a state of constant apprehension.
Meanwhile, Linda, with her infectious laughter and offbeat charm, counters with her own tales of woe. Each failed business venture is narrated with such dramatic flair that one might think she's reciting a Shakespearean tragedy. She talks about her pet boutique that failed because, as it turns out, iguanas aren't big fans of diamond-studded collars. Then there was the time she tried to revolutionize the world of fitness with her "underwater aerobics for seniors" - a concept that proved to be a literal sink-or-swim situation.
Her relationships are no better. Linda recounts tales of lovers who turned out to be anything from pathological liars to would-be ghost hunters. One ex-boyfriend, she reveals with a dramatic sigh, was even a self-proclaimed "vampire" who found garlic bread to be his mortal enemy. And just when Kevin thinks he's heard it all, Linda drops another bomb - her recurring battles with sleepwalking. She describes waking up in odd places, from her neighbor's hot tub to the city park's duck pond.
