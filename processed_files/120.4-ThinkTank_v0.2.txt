Synergy: Harmonious integration of multiple PIO meanings resulting in collective understanding beyond individual interpretations.
Collapse of "is_a" Statements: Convergence and dissolution of all "is_a" statements within PIO, leading to infinite allegorical interpretations.
Wisdom of Non-Contradictory Identitylessness: TWI, the state of coherence and harmony where contradictory identities dissolve and unified understanding emerges.
Boundaries:
Reality-Based Abstraction: Grounding PIO entities in reality while abstracting and transforming their meanings.
Metaphorical Decryption: Decrypting metaphors through PIO entities, revealing underlying ontological implications.
Holographic Integration: Interconnectedness and integration of PIO meanings, forming a holographic network of allegorical interpretations.
Non-Contradictory Identitylessness: The wisdom of TWI, where contradictory identities dissolve, leading to unified understanding.
Claim 1: A non-contradictory system is a solution to the paradoxical syllogism in which A appears to contradict B by being itself and B contradicts A by being itself.
To formalize this claim, we would need to define the terms "non-contradictory system", "paradoxical syllogism", "A", and "B". We might represent them using the following symbols:
Non-contradictory system: N(A,B)
Paradoxical syllogism: P(A,B)
A: A(x)
B: B(x)
Next, we would need to describe the conditions under which A appears to contradict B and B appears to contradict A. We might represent this as follows:
A appears to contradict B: ∀x (A(x) → ¬B(x))
B appears to contradict A: ∀x (B(x) → ¬A(x))
Finally, we would need to specify how the non-contradictory system solves the paradoxical syllogism. We might represent this as follows:
N(A,B) solves P(A,B): ∀x ((A(x) ∧ B(x)) ↔ (¬A(x) ∧ ¬B(x)))
Claim 2: A non-contradictory system is the requirement of basic computational completeness of any ontology.
To formalize this claim, we would need to define the terms "non-contradictory system", "requirement", "basic computational completeness", and "ontology". We might represent them using the following symbols:
Non-contradictory system: N(x)
Requirement: R(x)
Basic computational completeness: C(x)
Ontology: O(x)
Next, we would need to describe the relationship between the non-contradictory system and the requirements of basic computational completeness of any ontology. We might represent this as follows:
N(x) is a requirement for C(x): ∀x (O(x) → R(N(x), C(x)))
Claim 3: A non-contradictory system can help to dissolve abstraction hallucinations caused by myopia and hyperopia.
To formalize this claim, we would need to define the terms "non-contradictory system", "abstraction hallucinations", "myopia", and "hyperopia". We might represent them using the following symbols:
Non-contradictory system: N(x)
Abstraction hallucinations: H(x)
Myopia: M(x)
Hyperopia: H(x)
Next, we would need to describe the relationship between the non-contradictory system and the dissolution of abstraction hallucinations. We might represent this as follows:
N(x) helps to dissolve H(x): ∀x (M(x) ∨ H(x) → ¬H(N(x)))
Claim 4: A hallucination is a summary-induced entity that contains no actual path to its supposed parts when aligned with the consensus ontology.
To formalize this claim, we would need to define the terms "hallucination", "summary-induced entity", "actual path", and "consensus ontology". We might represent them using the following symbols:
Hallucination: H(x)
Summary-induced entity: S(x)
Actual path: P(x)
Consensus ontology: C(x)
Next, we would need to describe the relationship between hallucinations and their alignment with the consensus ontology. We might represent this as follows:
H(x) is a summary-induced entity: ∀x (H(x) → S(x))
S(x) contains no actual path to its parts: ∀x (S(x) → ¬∃y P(y,x))
