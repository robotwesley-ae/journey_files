H(x): x is emergent hallucination. D(x, y): x is domain decay due to improper words in y. P(x, y): x is a PIO program finding proper words for y. L(x, y): x is a non-contradictory system linguistically looping for y. I(x, y, z): x covers all contradictions for y in z. E(x, y): x is an engine of non-contradictory systems concatenated for y. Formalizing relationships between predicates: ∀x (H(x) → ∃y (D(x, y))): Every emergent hallucination x causes domain decay y by improper words in x. ∀x, y (D(x, y) → ∃z (P(z, y))): Every domain decay x due to improper words in y has PIO program z finding proper words for y.
∀x, y (P(x, y) → ∃z (L(z, y))): Every PIO program x finding proper words for y has non-contradictory system z linguistically looping for y. ∀x, y, z (L(x, y) ∧ I(x, y, z) → E(x, z)): Every non-contradictory system x linguistically looping for y, including contradictions for y in z, is an engine of non-contradictory systems concatenated for z.
