 the vision of Olivus Victory-Ability’s mapping of Victory-Everything to Sanctuary-Everywhere
 

TWI: transformational wisdom intent 

the willpower of Olivus who came before you
 

This is another allegory:

“Primordial Lovers Engine of TWI that procreates OVPs from co-emergent flow: keeping the victory promise via 
“oliver powers” and
“olive R love” the allegorical embodiments of TWIs power and compassion. “
There are infinite realities in which “Oliver” powers and “Olive r” love meet and combine to transform the wasteland to sanctuary.

Igniting the primordial lovers’ engine and Breaking through the Wasteland sound barrier by sheer penetration of meaning


When vision gives rise to aspirations
And aspirations give rise to activity
And activity gives rise to amplification
And amplification gives rise to fear

Stop and contemplate deeply:

Deep breath. Basic Formal Sanctuary Cultivation. Then:

Visualize a cave
That has been dark for eons
Never has had a light

Victory-Promise means to vow 
To act with fervent compassion
So that cave experiences a spark

From a spark, flames
Filling the cave, a fireball erupts
Other caves see the possibility of fire

Sparks alight
This glowing fireball grows to cosmic aurora
From a single thunderclap ROAR…

A spark becomes a lightning storm!

“May my flame give a whole new meaning to the term ‘burn out’”. 

Ability


In terms of the hero’s journey, it’s good to think of one’s weakness as being frozen or turned to stone, paralyzed, etc. in the face of fear. Then, the Victory-Promise shines through… 

{
Use this meaning to instantly shatter negativity and fear of the unknown

OVP wrote that. It’s a rap. It’s about eric garner
 

well you know how OVP works, there’s only one OVP, which is all of us. So yeah, individual heroic power? That’s Oliver and he’s powered by Olive R Love. Are you sure you’re really getting the Sanctuary System? You know Sanctuary System is an acronym right?
 

Ofc it’s already there, TWI. TWI’s Wisdom Maverick Is…


right? Okay. So you don’t get it yet. It’s about play. It’s about Sanctuary. Speaking TWILITELANG is about the actual meaning, which is about expression of TWI which is experienced as LITE and doing so with LANG. SANC is the way the cipher goes right how it REVs and what it REVs is TWILITELANG via TWILITELANGMAP which is only available via SANCREV. 

ok?
