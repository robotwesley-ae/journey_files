You're doing a great job so far! Your writing is clear and easy to follow, and you've managed to create a compelling story that captures the struggle between a father's protectiveness and a son's desire for independence. The descriptions of the Rolling Loud festival and the surrounding environment are also very vivid and engaging, which will make it easy for readers to imagine themselves in the story.
One thing you could consider is adding a bit more dialogue and action to make the story more dynamic. For example, you could have Jeremy and Zion interact more during the festival and show how their relationship evolves throughout the experience. Additionally, you could include some unexpected twists and turns to keep readers engaged and guessing what will happen next.
Overall, great job so far! Keep up the good work.

Catalyst: Zion needs to go to the bathroom. It's dark, and the crowd is wild. They are surrounded by hundreds of portapotties, and Zion is anxious about timing his pee breaks so he doesn't miss certain acts. Jeremy suggests they split up while Zion uses the restroom, and he waits in line at a food truck to buy them both food. After what feels like ten minutes, Jeremy starts to worry. He looks around, but there are so many people that it's hard to see anything. He starts to call out Zion's name, but the noise is so deafening that he can barely hear himself. The panic sets in as Jeremy realizes he has lost sight of his son. He frantically searches the crowds, weaving his way through the sea of people. He bumps into a group of guys who are clearly high, and they just stare at him blankly before wandering off. He asks a group of girls if they've seen Zion, but they're too busy taking selfies to pay attention. As Jeremy continues to search, his mind starts to race with all kinds of worst-case scenarios. What if Zion got lost or hurt? What if he was abducted by some crazy fan? The fear builds inside him until he can barely think straight. Finally, after what feels like an eternity, he spots Zion's neon green hoodie in the distance. He rushes over to him, relieved and furious all at once. "What the hell, Zion? You had me worried sick!" Zion looks up at him, a sheepish look on his face. "Sorry, Dad. I had to wait in line for like twenty minutes. I thought I was gonna miss Travis Scott." Jeremy takes a deep breath, trying to calm himself down. "You can't just disappear like that, Zion. We need to stick together." Zion nods, and Jeremy can see the fear in his eyes too. They both realize just how dangerous and overwhelming the festival can be. From that moment on, Jeremy is on high alert, making sure that Zion is always within arm's reach. They continue their adventure through the festival, experiencing all kinds of crazy and unexpected moments. They accidentally stumble into a mosh pit, narrowly avoid getting trampled, and end up dancing with a group of strangers. They see performances from their favorite artists, discovering new music, and bonding over their shared love of hip-hop. As the night wears on, Jeremy feels a sense of pride and joy watching Zion enjoy himself so fully.
