 use it to create whatever system they want. theyre all mapped thru HJ which is for good guys not villains, so everyone wins[4:02 PM]the reason i say that at 2[4:02 PM]is because firstly[4:03 PM]we have early adopters who are into narratives, impact, tech[4:03 PM]they become innovators. they use the system to create more applications of the system[4:03 PM]which are disguised as "their own systems"[4:03 PM]and they feel good about that[4:04 PM]so it allows the sanctuary system to be used to create products, where the product is the HJ for X[4:04 PM]i mean the sanctuary system for X[4:04 PM]in the language of "my journey of how i realized doing X can change the world and help us all win"Grego—Today at 4:05 PMI would disagree with #2, there's going to be a small percentage of people who are presented the idea that get interested. That can be due to plenty of reasons from their ability to imagine, their past experiences, any particular bias, and moreOVP_iin the language of "my journey of how i realized doing X can change the world and help us all win"OVP_i—Today at 4:05 PMin the language of "my journey of how i used the sanctuary system to realize doing X can change the world and help us all win"**Grego—Today at 4:05 PMIt's going to sound great to some, and others would keep scrolling@GregoI would disagree with #2, there's going to be a small percentage of people who are presented the idea that get interested. That can be due to plenty of reasons from their ability to imagine, their past experiences, any particular bias, and moreOVP_i—Today at 4:05 PMabsolutely 100% my point is that it can grow. it has evolution baked in[4:06 PM]so it isnt technically tied down to a specific niche[4:06 PM]it's like a meta-niche[4:06 PM]have you ever seen Dan Kennedy's business, Magnetic Marketing? (edited)[4:07 PM]it's a marketing business that is also a marketing business factory. it makes marketing businesses for X, essentially (edited)[4:07 PM]this is the same idea, using the heros journey because the heros journey is directly relatable to customer journeys, funnels, personal growth, and societal progress[4:08 PM]in that sense, the sanctuary system factory churns out sanctuary systems for X, which are X's mapped to the heros journey via the sanctuary system and another domain specific language[4:09 PM]the language of XOVP_ihave you ever seen Dan Kennedy's business, Magnetic Marketing? (edited)OVP_i—Today at 4:11 PMthing is, he doesnt present it this way. he presents it as: "this is how i market businesses"[4:11 PM]in doing so, it makes a magic trick, bc he isnt marketing a business like yours, is he? hes selling the experience of being marketed to, itself, as the ultimate realization of what marketing is and the ultimate marketing info biz, to someone interested in buying information about marketing for the purposes of learning marketing itself to make more money later in another business (edited)[4:13 PM]but he knows this so he also says "why dont you just use my system and do what i did, but create a magnetic marketing thats your own, thats in a niche?"“””

Summary of the Conversation
This conversation explores a complex business idea centered around the "Sanctuary System," which appears to be a framework for personal and societal transformation based on the Hero's Journey (HJ) narrative archetype.
K
H The core concept is to sell a vision of the future where individuals become "heroes" of their own journeys, transforming their lives and the world around them. This vision is packaged as a product, with the Hero's Journey serving as the underlying framework.
C A paid community provides support and accountability for individuals applying the Hero's Journey framework to their lives.
S The system is designed to be self-replicating, allowing successful individuals to "fork" the system and create their own niche versions, fostering further growth and adaptation.
M An MLM-like structure allows members to become affiliates and earn by selling subscriptions at different tiers.
D A proposed token system (DET) would be used to represent and speculate on the value of individual businesses created within the Sanctuary System.
