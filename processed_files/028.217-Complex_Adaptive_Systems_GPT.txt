make sure the stage 1 outputs met the input requirements fully in terms of meaning. then proceed to the next level of granularity, starting at stage 1. expand stage 1 using your entire output space, going into as many levels of granularity fit in the space. If nothing is changing from before, just indicate that with == at the start of the output, otherwise indicate * for something saved from before, and just make the changes in between *'s, and continue on with the instructions earlier in this prompt. 

Don't get confused. Prioritize moving to the next level of granularity over making changes that do not affect the meaning. Use the * to indicate preservation of meaning from previous outputs, for instance:

*1
*2
[addition between *2 and *3]
*3
...
[Next level of granularity]

If i previously instructed you to continue and you moved to the next level of granularity already, that means you need to use ==

The output you should refer to is this one:
