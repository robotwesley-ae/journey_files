Within conditions
There is you
Within you 
There is your mind 
Within your mind
There is the substrate
Within your substrate
There is a pulse that seems to be outside 
Within the pulse that seems to be outside
There is a thought-feeling that seems to be inside
Within the thought-feeling that seems to be inside 
There are two possibilities 
Sleeping
Awakening 
Within the possibilities 
There are causes 
Within the causes 
There are conditions 

This is how to take the substrate as the path and uncover your true identity as Identityless wisdom:
 
From the cause, the conditions
From the conditions, the pulse 
From the pulse that seems to be outside, the thought-feeling that seems to be inside
From the thought-feeling that seems to be inside
Know the pulse that seems to be inside
From the substrate
From the conditions
From the cause 
And collapse the false perception of inside and outside, so your awareness is just a bare pulse of the outside-inside-in-side-out-side-in display 

Sometimes the pulse feels like 
a needle point
Or points
Or waves crashing over you
It can arise these ways as you recognize it
But really, it continually arises as any feelings at all 
In fact it is composed of all of the physical and non-physical aspects of you and your so-called external reality, including your mind 
In fact it is this which is your very Identityless wisdom mind, which you think is the substrate — how funny, I can’t wait till you see “that”! 
And this pulse that is your mind has a pattern that can’t truly be called a pattern since it is like ripples on water that can morph into anything at all like transforming diamond clouds in the multi-dimensional sky
In other words, this pulse is “the now” 
In its full, perfect, playful wisdom display 
And searching for a pattern will only lead you astray, because you simply need to recognize the pattern of the pulse which somehow appears to have no pattern, like an optical illusion! 
Sometimes it is seen, sometimes not
If you attune to and harmonize with the pulse of the now of the playful display
The display that is the radiant dynamic* 
of your own mind 
will playfully display itself 
Because it already is!
You may think “this experience isn’t awakening, it is just mine” 
You need to think “if what I’m reading is true, my true identity is awakening and this experience is the display of it already — I must recognize it while its reflection is right here!” 
Not seeing it is dis-play 
Seeing it
you can actually do 
the method of cultivation known as breaking through ignorance by opening the mind to awakening in the Timeless Webbed Infinitude of Infinite Perfection 
Through letting your misconceptions relax and destroy themselves. 
As you do this, this pulse will become more and more purified
The counterpart method of cultivation called Symbolic Travel Beyond Ignorance
Refers to the way the stages and their various flaws may be symbolically traveled beyond and their powers made implicitly or latently present, to be revealed to the mind at the right time during the method of cultivation known as breaking through ignorance by opening the mind until awakening in the Timeless Webbed Infinitude of Infinite Perfection inside of the universal book of this same dream-like display 

So first collapse all the concepts you have 
about the world and reality, 
just don’t worry about them for now: 
set them aside - naturally 
so you can naturally experience 
your own nature of yourself 
in a natural way…
Then, without letting it take you anywhere, just simply and ordinarily relax into the actual reality of the Wisdom of the true identity of your own mind. 
Know that you must remain like this, free of the impulse of rejection, as you let your mind reveal itself in these “investigations.” 

*(people usually want to call it something here like “stuff” but it isn’t) 

Now, free of the impulse of rejection, read the entirety of this text while letting all of your thoughts dissolve naturally.
