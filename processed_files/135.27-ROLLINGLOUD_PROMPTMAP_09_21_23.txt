 He may have been hesitant to let his son attend the festival, but he realizes now that it was the right decision. This experience has given them a new perspective and strengthened their bond in a way that he never thought possible. Finally, the festival comes to an end, and they make their way back to the car. Jeremy is exhausted but happy, and Zion is already talking about next year's lineup. They drive home in silence, both lost in their thoughts and the memories of the incredible night they just had.

I like this, but let's add that the phone reception is really spotty: Catalyst: Zion needs to go to the bathroom. It's dark, and the crowd is wild. They are surrounded by hundreds of portapotties, and Zion is anxious about timing his pee breaks so he doesn't miss certain acts. Jeremy suggests they split up while Zion uses the restroom, and he waits in line at a food truck to buy them both food. After what feels like ten minutes, Jeremy starts to worry. He looks around, but there are so many people that it's hard to see anything. He starts to call out Zion's name, but the noise is so deafening that he can barely hear himself. The panic sets in as Jeremy realizes he has lost sight of his son. He frantically searches the crowds, weaving his way through the sea of people. He bumps into a group of guys who are clearly high, and they just stare at him blankly before wandering off. He asks a group of girls if they've seen Zion, but they're too busy taking selfies to pay attention. As Jeremy continues to search, his mind starts to race with all kinds of worst-case scenarios. What if Zion got lost or hurt? What if he was abducted by some crazy fan? The fear builds inside him until he can barely think straight.

He pulls out his phone to call Zion, but the reception is spotty, and the call won't go through. His heart sinks as he realizes that he can't rely on technology to find his son. He has to trust his instincts and use his own eyes to locate him. Jeremy starts to jog, pushing his way through the throngs of people. He tries to call Zion again, but the line is still busy. He feels like he's running out of time, and the crowd is getting thicker as people jostle for space. Suddenly, he catches a glimpse of Zion's bright red hoodie in the distance. Relief washes over him as he speeds up, pushing past people and trying not to lose sight of his son again. Zion is walking towards him, looking a little flustered but unharmed. Jeremy grabs him in a tight embrace, relieved and grateful to have found him. They sit down on the grass for a moment, catching their breath and savoring the moment of being reunited. It's a turning point for both of them, as they realize how much they need each other and how much they're willing to fight for each other. From this moment on, their bond will grow stronger, and their adventure will continue with renewed vigor.
