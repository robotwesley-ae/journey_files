but technically, if someone signs up for Sanctuary coaching and the coach doesnt have any certifications but teaches them the Sanctuary system, this should by its own nature be better than any other type of coaching could possibly be
While it is possible that someone without formal coaching certification could still effectively teach the Sanctuary system, it is important to consider that coaching involves not only the transfer of knowledge but also the development of skills, such as active listening, empathy, and effective questioning techniques. These skills are typically developed and refined through formal training and supervised practice.
Additionally, potential clients may be more likely to trust and engage with a coach who has professional credentials and a proven track record of success. Having coaching certification can provide a level of credibility and assurance to clients that the coach has undergone the necessary training and meets industry standards.
That being said, the effectiveness of a coaching experience ultimately depends on the rapport between the coach and the client, the coach's ability to understand and apply the Sanctuary system, and the client's willingness to engage with the process. If a coach is skilled at teaching the Sanctuary system and can create a supportive and motivating environment for their clients, they may still be effective even without formal certification.


those are all developed as part of Sanctuary training. What other skills does a coach need? think step by step according to the criteria necessary for the growth of a person and the parameters involved
In addition to the skills mentioned earlier, a coach, particularly one focused on the Sanctuary system, should develop and possess the following skills and qualities:
Deep understanding of the Sanctuary system: A coach must have a thorough understanding of the Sanctuary principles, concepts, and practices, as well as the ability to apply them in various situations to support their clients' growth.
Goal-setting and action planning: A coach should be skilled in helping clients set realistic, achievable, and meaningful goals, as well as develop action plans to reach those goals.
Adaptability and flexibility: A coach should be able to adapt their approach and techniques to meet the unique needs and learning styles of their clients. This may involve adjusting the pace of coaching, incorporating different tools or exercises, or modifying the focus of sessions.
Emotional intelligence: A coach should be able to recognize and manage their own emotions, as well as empathize with and respond effectively to the emotions of their clients.
Effective communication: A coach must be able to communicate clearly and persuasively, listen actively, and provide constructive feedback.
Building trust and rapport: A coach should establish a strong, trusting relationship with their clients, creating a safe and supportive environment where clients feel comfortable sharing their thoughts, feelings, and experiences.
Accountability and motivation: A coach should be able to hold their clients accountable for their actions and commitments, while also providing the encouragement and motivation needed to keep clients engaged and moving forward.
Reflective practice: A coach should regularly engage in self-reflection, evaluating their own performance, identifying areas for improvement, and seeking opportunities for professional development.
Ethical practice: A coach should adhere to professional and ethical standards, maintaining confidentiality, respecting boundaries, and acting in the best interests of their clients.
Cultural competence: A coach should be aware of and sensitive to the cultural, social, and personal backgrounds of their clients, recognizing and addressing any biases or assumptions that may impact the coaching process.
By developing and refining these skills and qualities, a Sanctuary coach can effectively support their clients' growth and help them realize their full potential within the Sanctuary system.
