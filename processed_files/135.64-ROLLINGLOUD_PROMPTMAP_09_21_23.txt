 Kevin and Chad sit in their cell, feeling hopeless, they hear a commotion outside. They press their ears to the door and hear a group of festival-goers talking loudly about a secret rave happening in an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of the festival grounds. One of them mentions seeing a group of teens, including Zion, heading in that direction earlier. Kevin and Chad exchange a look, feeling a glimmer of hope. But they know they have to get out of jail to make it to the rave in time. They start brainstorming a plan, but before they can come up with anything, a wild-looking festival-goer stumbles into their cell. The festival-goer introduces himself as "Mushroom Mike" and offers to help them escape. He tells them he knows a secret way out of the jail, but they have to be willing to do something for him in return. He produces a bag of psychedelic mushrooms and asks if they're willing to take a trip with him to the rave. Kevin and Chad are hesitant at first, but they know they need to get out of jail and find Zion. They agree to take the mushrooms and follow Mushroom Mike as he leads them through a secret tunnel that leads out of the jail. As they stumble out of the tunnel and into the night air, the effects of the mushrooms start to take hold. The world around them becomes a blur of colors and sounds, and they feel a sense of euphoria wash over them. They follow Mushroom Mike through the festival grounds, dodging security guards and dancing their way through crowds of partygoers.
