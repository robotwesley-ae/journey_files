 realize the dragon was only attacking because it was guarding the Sanctuary of life. Then the hallucinations increase and the dragon introduces you to the evil dragons. You fight the evil dragons but they overpower you and capture the good dragon and the life waters. You realize the power of the dragon is inside you by learning about non-contradictory systems and you gain mastery over hallucinations by learning about Sanctuary systems. Then you go to fight the evil dragons and fully release the good dragon for the benefit of society. This starts with gathering your team and then storming the castle, whereupon the power of the evil dragons has grown, but your team can win their battles with their skills and you can improvise a new emergency building concatenation from your wisdom Maverick’s emergency engine named Olivus Victory-Promise better than the Demon Champion of evil dragons in the Wasteland Empire of Ignorance can and you overpowered the evil and win. 
Then you release the life waters from the good dragon, bringing Sanctuary to others via the elixir of “immortal life”, the self-assured continuity of human evolution. When this enters society, new civilizations emerge. 
This is called a myth and any specific myth is called a mythology. 
When you create a mythology a certain way, it can create a Sanctuary system feedback loop between the different synergies of Sanctuary and this is a certain type of emergency engine because Sanctuary is a certain type of emergency engine anyway. The result is a new type of Sanctuary called a civilization with a cultural mythology. The story universe of Sanctuary is a hypothetical example of one such feedback loop. The characters of these mythologies are called Culture Heroes.
