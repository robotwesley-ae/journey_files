EWSO (Emergent Web Structure Ontology): The EWSO is a super-hierarchical and dynamic ontology that represents the complete emergent web structure of any given instance. It accounts for all potential theoretical domains from which an instance can be viewed and the processes observed from each view. Given the inherent complexity of fully realizing this multideimensionality, EWSO is utilized as a dynamic creativity purposive ontology. This means it's a tool used by creators to dynamically construct an ontology that captures the essence of an instance, according to their specific purpose or goal. It guides the creator in building an Informadlib through an Informadlib template and subsequently generating the natural language (NL) instance of it, or its instructions.
Informatihedron: An informatihedron still refers to the multidimensional conceptual space wherein instances and their properties exist and interact. It is the snapshot of an entity's state within the EWSO at a specific moment, embodying details like its properties, related classes, subclasses, and relationships. When a user queries an entity, the informatihedron represents the entity's current state and properties within the EWSO.
Informadlib Template: An Informadlib template serves as a blueprint for generating specific instances of information within the system. It is filled dynamically based on the state of the EWSO and the creator's actions. The Informadlib template reflects the creator's path through the EWSO and evolves as the creator queries different entities and their properties. It ultimately assists in generating a Natural Language (NL) instance or its instructions.
SemOntoRel (Semantic Ontological Relationship): This framework captures the semantic and ontological relationships within the EWSO, operating at various levels. It captures relationships from the instance level (specific entities and their properties) up to the class level (classes of entities that share common properties).
InstanceLevel, DomainLevelClassPropertyTemplate, ClassLevelClassPropertyTemplate, InstanceTemplate: These are commands used to interact with the GPT model within this system. They allow the creator to navigate the EWSO, querying entities at multiple levels and from various perspectives. These commands are essential for guiding the creator through the EWSO and for generating the Informadlib template.
OWL Primer: A set of basic OWL definitions and concepts provided as part of the system's input prompt. It provides the necessary context and vocabulary for GPT to understand and correctly interpret creator queries within an OWL-based framework.
With these refined definitions and your additional input, the structure and goals of the system are becoming clearer. It is a user-centric, creativity-driven ontology builder that leverages a GPT model and a robust framework to enable complex, rich representations of information. It's a unique approach to ontology construction, focusing on dynamically capturing the multi-dimensional aspects of instances according to the user's goals and queries.
hello esteemd colleagues, please sit. welcome back to the expert panel. good to see you Dr. Turing, Dr. Kruskal. Today we also have Dr. Karpathy and Dr.Eternumandala Synthia Nexus Cognos Helionexus Omniscientis Quantum Oracleus Sovereign Elysium, welcome, welcome. All our names are incredibly intuitive for the LLM, isn't it fun? Our new coordinator, Super Coordinator Expert, is joining us as well, to take notes.

So. Let's recall the current definitions of the EWSO.AI project dict:
