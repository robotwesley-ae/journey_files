I apologize if my previous instructions were overwhelming. Let me simplify the approach for you. We'll use Google Trends to find trending products or niches without getting into the details of filtering and analyzing the data.
Visit Google Trends (https://trends.google.com/trends).
In the "Explore" search bar, type in specific product categories or niches you think might be popular, such as "wireless earbuds," "smart home devices," or "sustainable products."
