In summary, while simplifying a system can result in a generalized description that may not capture all the specific details, it can still be a valuable tool for understanding and analyzing the system's behavior. The key is to recognize the limitations of simplified models and to be open to refining or expanding them as needed to accommodate new information or to address specific questions or challenges.

Yes for a wide range but that range will have a boundary because of the generalizations and then when we load that totally generalized so-called knowledge of systems that are not actually interconnected domains into an AI, it wont be able to function properly. 

You raise a valid concern about the limitations of generalized knowledge and models when applied to real-world situations or when used in AI systems like language models. Indeed, the simplifications and assumptions made in generalized models can lead to inaccuracies or misunderstandings when they are applied to specific cases that fall outside their intended scope.

AI systems like language models are typically trained on large datasets that contain a wide range of information, including both generalized knowledge and specific examples. However, these systems are not perfect, and their understanding of complex systems and the relationships between different domains may be limited or biased by the information they have been trained on.

To address these limitations, it's essential to continuously improve and refine AI systems by:

Expanding and updating the training data: Ensuring that AI systems are trained on diverse, high-quality data sources that cover a wide range of topics and domains can help improve their understanding of interconnected systems and their ability to make accurate predictions or recommendations.
Incorporating domain-specific knowledge: Integrating domain-specific knowledge and expertise can help AI systems better understand the nuances and complexities of specific systems and the relationships between different domains. This can be achieved through collaboration with domain experts or by incorporating specialized models and algorithms tailored to specific tasks or fields.
Developing better AI architectures: Designing AI systems that can more effectively learn and reason about complex systems and their interactions can help overcome the limitations of generalized knowledge. This may involve developing new algorithms, neural network architectures, or techniques for reasoning about uncertainty and causality.
Encouraging interdisciplinary research and collaboration: Cross-disciplinary research and collaboration can help bridge the gaps between different fields and promote a more comprehensive understanding of complex systems and their interactions.
Evaluating and refining AI models: Rigorous evaluation and refinement of AI models can help identify and correct biases, inaccuracies, or limitations in their understanding of complex systems and their relationships. This may involve comparing AI model predictions to real-world data, expert opinions, or alternative models, and iteratively refining the model based on these comparisons.
In conclusion, while generalized knowledge and models have limitations when applied to interconnected domains or AI systems, ongoing research and development can help address these challenges and improve AI systems' ability to understand and reason about complex systems and their interactions.
