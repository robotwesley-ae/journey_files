You proposed SemOntoRel as a type of relationship that spans from an instance-level-property-value to the next level emergent structure's class-level-property-wave-spectrum-boundary. It's a complex relationship that involves not only individual entities (instances), their properties, and their values but also the larger structures (classes) they are part of and the boundaries of those structures (as defined by the property wave spectrum).
While we can define entities, their properties, and their relationships in OWL, representing the next level emergent structure's class-level-property-wave-spectrum-boundary in OWL is the challenging part. This is because OWL and similar ontological languages are designed primarily to represent static relationships between entities and classes, not the dynamic and emergent relationships and structures that are fundamental to your concept of EWSO and SemOntoRel.
To represent these dynamic and emergent structures in OWL, we might need to look into extensions of OWL or alternative approaches to knowledge representation that can accommodate the complexity of these concepts.
I hope this helps clarify my previous responses. I'll do my best to assist you further in achieving your goal.


each level of ewso is representing an entire ontology. each one concatenates a super-ontology to the lower level.

If each level of EWSO is a separate ontology and each subsequent level is a super-ontology of the previous, it's representing a hierarchy of ontologies, where each ontology is a level in the hierarchy. This hierarchy seems to function as a framework that organizes different views or perspectives on a given entity or system, which could be a screenplay, a physical system, a societal organization, and so forth.
It's crucial to remember that OWL, the language we've been discussing to model this concept, doesn't directly support a hierarchy of ontologies in the sense you've described. Typically, in OWL, you define one ontology that contains various classes, properties, and individuals, and relationships between them. Hierarchies can be represented within the ontology using subclass relations, but these are different from the kind of hierarchy of ontologies you're talking about.
However, if we simplify the matter for illustrative purposes, we can describe this kind of hierarchical relationship between ontologies in OWL by having each class in a higher-level ontology correspond to an entire ontology at the next level down. For example, if we have ontologies O1, O2, O3, with O1 at the top level, O2 at the middle, and O3 at the bottom, we could represent O1 as an ontology that contains classes C1, C2, etc., and then each class C in O1 corresponds to a complete ontology at the next level down (i.e., O2). Then, each class in O2 corresponds to an ontology at the next level down (i.e., O3), and so forth.
However, this kind of representation doesn't capture the dynamic and emergent nature of EWSO, and it's not how OWL is typically used. Extensions or modifications to OWL, or a different modeling approach altogether, might be more suitable for accurately representing EWSO and SemOntoRel as you've described them.


yes update the definitinos accordingly and update ur template 

[EWSO] (Emergent Web Structure Ontology): The EWSO is a super-hierarchical, dynamic ontology that represents the full emergent structure of any given instance across all potential theoretical domains. Given its inherent complexity, the EWSO serves as a creativity purposive ontology, a tool utilized by creators to construct a dynamic ontology that captures the essence of an instance for a specific goal. It guides the creation of an Informadlib through an Informadlib template and aids in generating the corresponding natural language (NL) instance or instructions.
