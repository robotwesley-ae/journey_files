5.1.1. Follow the platform's deployment documentation
5.1.2. Set up any necessary hosting, domain, or SSL configurations
5.2. Monitor the trading bot's performance and adjust strategies as needed
5.2.1. Track key performance indicators (KPIs) like profitability, risk, and user satisfaction
5.2.2. Make data-driven decisions to improve the trading bot's strategies and features
5.3. Iterate on the application based on user feedback and market changes
5.3.1. Continuously refine and expand the trading bot's capabilities
5.3.2. Stay informed about market trends and adapt strategies accordingly

Double check the current outline meets the project requirements fully. then proceed to the next level of granularity, starting at the first step that needs to be expanded further. expand the granularities of that step and subsequent steps using your entire output space, going into as many stages, steps, and levels of granularity fit in the space. If nothing is changing from before, just indicate that with == at the start of the output. indicate * for something saved from before that we dont need to say, and just make the changes in between *'s, according to the instructions earlier in this prompt. Again, to be clear, you dont need to repeat parts that you arent changing. For example: if you said *3.2.2.2, 3.3, 3.3.1, *3.3.1.1, it could have been *3.2.2.2,*3.3.1.1... 
Make sure the outline stays formatted correctly and well structured for clarity. You will specify granularities until every single instruction is clear and no extra tasks need to be added in the course of following the instructions.
Since the previous outline provided a high level of granularity, I will expand on a few specific steps to ensure clarity. The outline remains largely the same, with changes indicated by an asterisk (*):
Stage 3: Develop the trading bot logic and continuous surf strategy.
*3.1. Define the trading rules and strategies
*3.1.1. Research existing trading strategies for inspiration
*3.1.1.1. Study trend-following, mean reversion, and momentum-based strategies
*3.1.1.2. Understand the risk management techniques used in various strategies
*3.1.2. Incorporate continuous surf logic into the strategy
3.1.2.1. Create a set of rules to identify assets that are trending upward
3.1.2.1.1. Define technical indicators and thresholds for identifying upward trends (e.g., moving averages, RSI, MACD)
3.1.2.1.2. Combine multiple indicators to increase the accuracy of trend identification
3.1.2.2. Create a set of rules to determine when to exit a position and switch to a higher-growth asset
3.1.2.2.1. Define technical indicators and thresholds for identifying exit points (e.g., trailing stop-loss, change in trend direction)
3.1.2.2.2. Calculate the minimum rate of change difference required to switch positions, considering fees and slippage
*3.1.2.3. Determine exit points to avoid downward trends or park in cash
3.1.2.3.1. Define technical indicators and thresholds for identifying downward trends (e.g., moving averages crossing, RSI overbought)
3.1.2.3.2. Implement a rule to exit a position and hold cash if no suitable upward-trending assets are available
*3.2. Implement the trading rules and strategies within the no-code platform
*3.2.1. Use the platform's visual programming or scripting capabilities
*3.2.1.1. Create custom logic for buy and sell signals
3.2.1.1.1. Set up conditional statements to trigger buy signals based on the defined technical indicators and thresholds
3.2.1.1.2. Set up conditional statements to trigger sell signals based on exit points, rate of change difference, or downward trends
*3.2.1.2. Implement risk management and position sizing
3.2.1.2.1. Determine the maximum percentage of the portfolio to allocate to each trade based on risk tolerance
3.2.1.2.2. Calculate position sizes based on the defined maximum allocation and current portfolio value
