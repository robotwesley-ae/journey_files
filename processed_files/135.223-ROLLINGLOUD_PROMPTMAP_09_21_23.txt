CHAD You know, they have a kissing booth here. It's awesome, although some people are getting herpes from it, so you have to be careful.
Chad chuckles, seemingly oblivious to Kevin's mounting panic. Kevin's frustration starts to bubble beneath the surface, but he tries to maintain composure.
KEVIN Yeah, I'll keep that in mind. Right now, I really need to find my son.
Kevin continues his search, his steps growing more hurried and urgent. He accidentally bumps into a group of high guys, who stare blankly before wandering away.
He approaches a group of selfie-taking girls, desperation evident in his voice.
KEVIN Excuse me, have you seen a young boy named Zion? He's about 13 years old.
The girls barely acknowledge him, too absorbed in capturing the perfect selfie. Kevin's heart sinks as he realizes their indifference. He stuffs another bite of food into his mouth, mind racing with worst-case scenarios.
CHAD Hey man, remember that documentary about lost children? Maybe we should start looking in trash cans and abandoned buildings.
Kevin, his frustration mounting, turns to Chad, trying to balance politeness with the urgency of the situation.
KEVIN Chad, I appreciate your help, but I really need to focus on finding Zion right now. Can you please give me some space?
Chad, sensing Kevin's distress and urgency, reluctantly backs off, understanding the gravity of the situation.
CHAD Yeah, sure, Kevin. I get it. Just let me know if you need anything, okay?
Kevin nods, his determination renewed as he watches Chad step back. He takes a deep breath, pushing aside the distractions around him. The weight of the situation rests heavily on his shoulders as he pushes through the crowd, searching for any sign of his beloved son.
With every step, his focus sharpens, his eyes scanning the faces of the festival-goers, desperately seeking any glimpse of Zion's familiar features. The pulsating energy of the venue becomes background noise as his determination takes over.
Kevin's heart pounds in his chest as he weaves through the crowd, occasionally catching sight of a small figure in the distance, only for it to turn out to be someone else. The fear of losing Zion forever gnaws at him, but he refuses to let it consume him.
He continues his relentless search, calling out Zion's name whenever he can, his voice strained and desperate. Each unanswered call heightens his anxiety, but he presses on, pushing past the fatigue and the doubts.
In the midst of the chaos, Kevin's love for his son propels him forward, driving him to search every corner of the festival. His determination is unwavering, his focus laser-sharp. Nothing will stop him until he finds Zion and holds him safely in his arms once again.
