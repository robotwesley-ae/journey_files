KEVIN Don't call my thirteen-year-old either of those. (growing concerned) Where is he? It's been like ten minutes...
Chad's obliviousness to Kevin's concerns is apparent as he continues reminiscing.
CHAD (nostalgic) Remember that time we shot fireworks by the canoe house and got totally hammered!?
Kevin, growing more anxious, responds absentmindedly.
KEVIN Uh, no, I don't remember that.
Kevin, succumbing to the nervous urge, begins to nibble on one of the dishes. He eats absentmindedly, his eyes darting around, searching for any sign of his missing son.
KEVIN (into his phone) Zion, where are you? It's been a while. Are you okay?
Kevin's voice trembles with worry as he tries to call Zion, but to his dismay, the phone service is spotty amidst the festival chaos.
KEVIN Frustrated with the lack of connection, he pockets his phone, his anxiety intensifying.
CHAD (curiously) Everything alright, Kevin?
KEVIN (nervously) I can't reach my son. He's been in the bathroom for an unusually long time. I need to find him.
Chad's expression changes from carefree to concerned.
CHAD Oh, man, I hope he's alright. Let's go check on him.
Kevin, his mouth still full, nods hurriedly, and they make their way towards the portapotties. The food in Kevin's hand remains untouched as his focus shifts entirely to the search for Zion.
The crowded festival grounds amplify Kevin's worry, the loud music and swirling crowd making it harder to spot his son. Each step feels heavier, every passing moment filled with mounting concern.
Kevin's heart races as they approach the line of portapotties. His eyes scan the doors, hoping to catch a glimpse of Zion's familiar face.
INT. PORTAPOTTY - CONTINUOUS
Inside the cramped space, Zion finishes up and washes his hands. Oblivious to the passing time, he steps out, ready to rejoin his father.
EXT. ROLLING LOUD VENUE - PORTAPOTTIES - CONTINUOUS
Kevin's eyes light up as he spots Zion emerging from one of the portapotties. Relief washes over him, momentarily erasing the weight of worry.
KEVIN (exhaling) Zion! Thank goodness you're okay!
Zion, a puzzled expression on his face, sees Kevin and Chad standing there, their expressions a mix of concern and relief.
ZION (confused) What's wrong, Dad?
KEVIN (gratefully) I couldn't find you, and I was getting really worried. Let's stick together, okay?
Kevin, his appetite long gone, tosses the untouched food into a nearby trash bin, his priority now ensuring his son's safety.
They exchange a silent nod, their

CHAD I’m sorry. I’m an idiot and a loser. I sometimes say the wrong thing when I’m trying to make friends, but it’s just because I’m... technically on the spectrum. But I’ve been working hard. And I understand if you never want to see me again. I should just kill myself. KEVIN No, no. It was a joke. Don’t kill yourself. Just... it’s fine. I’m on edge here. / rewrite the above lines by Chad to make it Kevin feel as bad as possible for yelling at him

CHAD I'm sorry, Kevin. I messed up. I never meant to make you feel bad. Sometimes, my attempts at humor can go astray. I struggle with social interactions, and I'm constantly learning. I understand if you're upset with me. I just want you to know that I'm working on it, and I value our friendship. I hope you can forgive me.
KEVIN (slightly remorseful) Chad, I didn't mean to make you feel like that. I know you didn't mean any harm. I'm just really stressed about finding Zion, and it's getting to me. I'm sorry for snapping at you.
Kevin's expression softens, realizing the impact his words had on Chad. He understands that Chad is trying his best, and he doesn't want to add to his friend's burden.
KEVIN (reassuring) Please, don't ever think about hurting yourself. I may be on edge right now, but it doesn't change the fact that you're my friend. We all make mistakes. Let's focus on finding Zion, okay?
Chad's face brightens, grateful for Kevin's understanding and forgiveness. They exchange a brief, supportive smile, united in their shared concern for Zion's well-being.
