 so and you give them your funnel for doing so[2:19 PM]idk if this is making sense yet lmkOVP_ithats not inherently worth anything monetarily, but it is just a victory-promiseOVP_i—Today at 2:22 PMyou make a contract to make the world a better place by buying in. you can sell that contract for what you think it's worth. you prove that by burning that amount every month. every contract you sell, you get 40% of, plus 40% of your convert's future contracts, as long as they stay on your fork maybe branch is what i mean and not fork, yet[2:22 PM]bc fork comes from when they want to add a custom product and make a new funnel on top of it that still uses the vision as the basis, so it plugs into the community[2:23 PM]then becomes an inside play[2:23 PM]type of saleGrego—Today at 2:30 PMIf this is something we automate and it works without our involvement then why not?OVP_i—Today at 2:33 PMexactly it's a higher order type of product[2:33 PM]that emerges from having the framework and the techOVP_i—Today at 3:17 PMok this is what im gonna build for sanctuary and then i think the agents go on top of it actually[3:21 PM]business model: give out free content educating about the heros journey (hj) and how to apply it to your life and then also run a community where people pay $20+/mo to receive support and accoutnability services about applying the heros journey irl. they can be affiliates at arbitrary tiers of potential they set themselves, bc they believe in their heros journey to sell it. crucially, the system is a self-replicating vision for changing the world: tranfsorming status quo wastelands via the elixir of sanctuary, which is a vision for the future. the point is that we allow it to niche and scale itself. anyone who successfully applies the framework (sanctuary system) to their life becomes the real hero of their own journey, and then can fork the system: write their own archetypal progenitor narrative universe where other people can then go and learn their version of the framework under a licensing model that has a yearly % based deal. all the transactions flow through the platform, their entier business is templated bc it also gets procreated from my funnel, and then they can change it from there, because the platform is about businesses and how they are doing, it makes sense to mint a new forked coin (DET - demon exorcism token) from a mother coin (Empowered Victory Promise), and then speculate on the value of the company via DET tokenomics[3:22 PM]@Grego make any sense yet?[3:22 PM]combined w the allegory system it can essentially compile heros journey lenses for people to look at themselves thru[3:22 PM]as the main feature[3:23 PM]and can do so "in sanctuary" (via SANC)[3:23 PM]so it's like an app where you go look at potential versions of your future self, which you ideate with AI[3:23 PM]and then you create a promise to actualize it, track that, create the obstacles and overcomes for the value ladder[3:23 PM]achieve your goal, launch your company[3:24 PM]and it all happens on chain and on platformGrego—Today at 3:52 PM[3:52 PM]my brain melted at DET[3:56 PM]I want, personally, to be cautious when making judgements and not make them before considering things carefully. My initial reactions are:you're a visionary with a great imagination and capacity for detailed plotwhat size population could this be after considering the % of total audience who would buy into the ideas[3:57 PM]this seems like something that would be tested using study groupsOVP_i—Today at 4:00 PMdefinitely. it would benefit from some product management work and surveys. it's still way too complicated. i have to lay it out@GregoI want, personally, to be cautious when making judgements and not make them before considering things carefully. My initial reactions are: you're a visionary with a great imagination and capacity for detailed plotwhat size population could this be after considering the % of total audience who would buy into the ideasOVP_i—Today at 4:02 PM1 - ty. 2 = everyone 3 - the interesting thing is that the testing essentially happens in me doing it the first time i create the sanctuary system the right way, allowing others to see how to
