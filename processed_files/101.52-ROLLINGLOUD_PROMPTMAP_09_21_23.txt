Feeling relieved, Jeremy turns to Chad, who's still in a giggly state, and tells him they need to find a way into the VIP section. He thinks for a moment, then remembers seeing a group of people in suits earlier who looked like they had access.
Jeremy and Chad make their way over to the group and strike up a conversation. Chad's high state makes things a bit awkward, but eventually, they manage to convince the group to let them in.
As they enter the VIP section, Jeremy scans the crowd for any sign of Zion. But there are so many people, and they all look the same in their fancy clothes and designer sunglasses.
Suddenly, a commotion catches his attention. He sees a group of girls screaming and pointing at a man who's making his way through the crowd. Jeremy squints and realizes that it's a celebrity -- the one that Zion mentioned on the phone.
With renewed determination, Jeremy pushes his way through the crowd, dragging Chad behind him. They finally reach the front of the stage, where the celebrity is standing.
Jeremy tries to get the celebrity's attention, but he's too caught up in the crowd. Chad, meanwhile, has spotted a group of people passing around a joint and makes a beeline for them.
As Jeremy continues to struggle, he sees a flash of curly red hair in the corner of his eye. He turns, and there's Zion, standing a few feet away, looking embarrassed.
Jeremy is overcome with emotion as he rushes over to his son, scooping him up in a bear hug. Chad, still giggling, joins in the hug.
For a moment, they're all lost in the moment, forgetting about their troubles and just happy to be together. But as the night wears on, they realize they need to head back home.
They make their way out of the festival, arm in arm, feeling a sense of closeness that they haven't felt in a long time. They know that they have a lot to work on, but for now, they're just happy to have each other.

Can we incorporate the girls who were flirting with them earlier, who had VIP bracelets into how they get into the VIP section?

Sure, here's a rewritten version:
As Chad finishes his emotional story, Jeremy's phone rings, interrupting their conversation. It's a call from his wife, who's furious and yelling on the other end of the line. Apparently, Zion butt-dialed her, and she heard everything -- including his son's voice saying something about sneaking into the VIP section to meet a celebrity.
Jeremy's mind races as he tries to come up with a cover story. He tells his wife that Zion is right there with him, and they're on their way to meet her.
His wife is still skeptical but buys the story, and Jeremy breathes a sigh of relief. He turns to Chad, who's still giggling uncontrollably, and tells him they need to get into the VIP section.
Just then, the girls who were flirting with them earlier come back into view, flashing their VIP bracelets. Jeremy has an idea and starts chatting them up, trying to find a way to get their hands on some VIP passes.
To his surprise, the girls are more than happy to help. They offer to sneak them into the VIP section using their extra bracelets, in exchange for a night of wild partying with Jeremy and Chad.
Jeremy and Chad agree, feeling a surge of excitement as they follow the girls into the VIP area. Once inside, they start scanning the crowd for any sign of Zion.

rewrite, but make Jeremy more proactive in tracking down the girls vs. them just appearing
