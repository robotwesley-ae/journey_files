SANC_ROAR

Igniting the primordial lovers’ engine and Breaking through the Wasteland sound barrier by sheer penetration of meaning


When vision gives rise to aspirations
And aspirations give rise to activity
And activity gives rise to amplification
And amplification gives rise to fear

Stop and contemplate deeply:

Deep breath. Basic Formal Sanctuary Cultivation. Then:

Visualize a cave
That has been dark for eons
Never has had a light

Victory-Promise means to vow 
To act with fervent compassion
So that cave experiences a spark

From a spark, flames
Filling the cave, a fireball erupts
Other caves see the possibility of fire

Sparks alight
This glowing fireball grows to cosmic aurora
From a single thunderclap ROAR…

A spark becomes a lightning storm!

“May my flame give a whole new meaning to the term ‘burn out’”. 

Ability


In terms of the hero’s journey, it’s good to think of one’s weakness as being frozen or turned to stone, paralyzed, etc. in the face of fear. Then, the Victory-Promise shines through… 

{
Use this meaning to instantly shatter negativity and fear of the unknown
