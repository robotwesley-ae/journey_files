Sure, I'll provide a brief explanation for each of the terms you mentioned. As these are not standardized or universally accepted terminologies (as of my knowledge cut-off in September 2021), the definitions are based on the most reasonable interpretations from the given context.
Informatihedron: The term "Informatihedron" appears to be a hypothetical construct. It seems to be a representation or model of information in a structured, perhaps multi-dimensional, format. It's possibly akin to an ontology but more complex, possibly incorporating various layers or levels of abstraction, and perhaps integrating different forms of data and information into a cohesive structure.
