INT. ROLLING LOUD FESTIVAL - VENDOR TENT - NIGHT
Kevin, Chad, and Linda, disheveled and panting, sit amidst the wreckage of the vendor's tent. They exchange a glance, then burst out laughing.
KEVIN (snickering) You guys... we must look insane!
Linda, covered in silly string, shrugs with a grin.
LINDA (normal, calm) Eh, I've looked worse.
Chad nudges Kevin, still chuckling.
CHAD (teasing) Oh, yeah. Like the time you wore that lime green suit to prom?
They all laugh harder. After a beat, Kevin's laughter fades. He takes a deep breath, an air of seriousness creeping in.
KEVIN (sincere) Hey... can I share something with you guys?
Chad, still laughing, doesn't notice the shift. Linda, however, sobers quickly.
LINDA (serious) Of course, Kevin. What's up?
Kevin proceeds to unload his struggles about his trial separation, his failing career, and his fears about telling Zion. Chad and Linda listen, their laughter fading away.
CHAD (sincere) Man, that's heavy. But, you're a great dad, Kev. You'll find a way through this.
LINDA (encouraging) And a great friend. We've got your back, Kevin.
The mood lightens, and they begin trading stories of their personal struggles - each one-upping the last in their outrageous tragic tales, from Chad's survivor guilt to Linda's shocking wedding day, failed businesses, and sleepwalking woes. The conversation takes a bizarre turn as they compete over their calamities.
KEVIN (incredulous) Wait, wait, wait... Linda, you're allergic to ALL medicines? And Chad, you were a drug mule? And... oh, dear God, an infected WHAT?
They all laugh again, the night air filled with their wild stories and shared camaraderie.
