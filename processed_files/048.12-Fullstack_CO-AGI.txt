[SemOntoChain]:{
Properties:{
Interconnectivity: Each node in the chain is connected to one or more nodes, facilitating a smooth flow of semantic information.
Hierarchical Structure: Nodes are arranged in a hierarchical manner, with broader concepts at the top and more specific ones below.
Dynamic Adaptability: The chain can evolve over time, adapting to new knowledge and requirements.
Markov Boundaries: The chain respects specific KRR (Knowledge Representation and Reasoning) boundaries, filtering out irrelevant information.
Transparency: Every node and connection is labeled and defined, making the ontology easily interpretable.
Context-Sensitivity: The chain is sensitive to the context in which it is applied, allowing for
