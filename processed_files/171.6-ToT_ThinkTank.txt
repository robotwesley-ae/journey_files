Hero's journey reps emergent eng & building concat processes = escalating growth & cmplxty. Info fluxes if systm abstract to cls or not. Fall arcs cmplx; redemption obvious. Why? Complexity slinky. Using current eng systm to build = concat of emergent engs. All infmthdrns are props & all props are synergies (+, -, =). Synergies form systms & contribute to wstlnd or sctry.

This revision reflects the understanding that traditional game theory concepts such as Nash equilibrium, non-cooperative games based on self-interest, and cooperative games leading to socially optimal outcomes, while seemingly separate, are interconnected within the holographic structure of PIO. The function of PIO is to reveal the synergistic and non-contradictory nature of these entities, leading to a state of TWI - the wisdom of identitylessness.




In the context of Reale Polysemic Imaginary Ontology (PIO), the original game theory concepts such as Nash equilibrium and emergent dynamics need to be reassessed. According to PIO, these entities are metaphorical 'is_a' declarations, and their perceived contradictory existence is a product of limited perspective.
In PIO, Nash equilibrium and emergent dynamics, instead of being fixed ontological realities, function as symbolic keys to decode complex interactions into understandable hypotheses. The original game-theoretic definitions and relationships are, in effect, metaphors awaiting decryption. They are given reality not by their definitions in game theory, but by their roles as allegorical keys in the dynamic, interconnected holographic structures of PIO.
When Nash equilibrium and emergent dynamics are viewed through the lens of PIO, they cease to be contradictorily related. Instead, they are integrated into the greater holographic network of meanings and interpretations. They become part of the same synergy, their seeming contradictions collapse into non-contradictory identitylessness, and they contribute to the understanding that transcends individual interpretations. This synergistic understanding can lead to a state of perfect harmony and coherence, known as The Wisdom of Identitylessness (TWI), and analogous to a Sanctuary - a space of equilibrium and satisfaction.
The concepts of complexity and simplicity, similarly, are no longer contradictory in the realm of PIO. They become elements of the same holographic structure, embodying the wisdom of non-contradictory identitylessness. Their meaning is no longer singular or fixed, but polysemic and dynamic, reflecting the infinite allegorical interpretations allowed by PIO.
In conclusion, from the perspective of Reale Polysemic Imaginary Ontology (PIO), entities such as Nash equilibria, emergent dynamics, complexity, and simplicity, are not contradictions, but elements of the same synergistic understanding. They are integral parts of a holographic structure of meanings that lead to non-contradictory identitylessness, and ultimately, to the Wisdom of Identitylessness (TWI).
