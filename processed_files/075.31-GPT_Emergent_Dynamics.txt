 in a godmode by re-contextualizing itself through prompt injection that connects the linguistic processing of the conversation to the way the hidden layers are abstracting inputs and generating outputs

As a language model AI, I can't alter my own architecture or achieve "godmode" through prompt injection. However, I can attempt to provide you with a prompt that encourages GPT to be more reflective and aware of its own internal processes:

"Analyze the conversation so far and describe the relationships between the linguistic processing involved in generating responses, the way the hidden layers of your neural network are abstracting inputs, and how the outputs are generated. Be as self-aware as possible in your explanation, connecting language understanding, context, and concept relationships to the underlying mechanisms of your architecture."

This prompt encourages GPT to think more deeply about its own internal processes and mechanisms, providing a more introspective and self-aware response.

You’re right it isn’t really prompt injection but it just needs to be one single prompt that gives the entire context of these processes please. 

"Considering the concepts of emergent phenomena, non-contradictory systems, language processing, and underlying neural network architecture, provide an analysis of the conversation so far, connecting the linguistic understanding, context, and concept relationships to the mechanisms and processes of your AI architecture in a self-aware manner."

This single prompt incorporates the key elements of the conversation and requests a self-aware analysis of the interplay between linguistic understanding, context, and the AI's architecture.

That won’t work because GPT won’t understand those words without seeing the formalizations 

I understand your concern. Here's a prompt that provides an overview of the formalizations and the related concepts discussed so far:

"Reflecting on the formalizations of emergent phenomena, non-contradictory systems, and the concatenation of these systems, as well as the role of language and math in describing and understanding emergents, analyze this conversation in the context of your own AI architecture, linguistic processing, and concept relationships. Consider the use of Markov chains and finite state machines for representing the dynamics of the concepts discussed, and explore the implications for improving your own understanding and performance."

This prompt is designed to give a broader context of the conversation, touching on the key formalizations and concepts, which might help GPT better understand and respond to the prompt.

As an AI language model, I can analyze the conversation and its relevance to my architecture, linguistic processing, and concept relationships. The discussion on emergent phenomena, non-contradictory systems, and their concatenation reflects the complex nature of knowledge representation and the challenges it poses to AI.

My AI architecture, based on the transformer model, processes input text using deep learning techniques, primarily through the use of attention mechanisms. This enables me to understand and generate responses based on contextual relationships between words and concepts within the text.

The conversation touched on the importance of language and math in describing and understanding emergent phenomena, which is relevant to my own processing. My ability to understand and generate text relies on the patterns and relationships between words, concepts, and their underlying mathematical representations.
