When Jeremy reaches the lost and found area and finds it closed, he could try knocking on the door and shouting, "Hello? Anyone in there? I lost my son and I really need to find him. Can you just open up for a second?" The absurdity of a closed lost and found in the midst of a huge festival could add a touch of humor.
As Jeremy tries to find a festival employee to help him, he could run into a few characters who are too busy with their own tasks to pay attention to him. For example, he might approach a woman who's selling festival merchandise and ask for her help, only to be met with a distracted "Sorry, man, I'm in the middle of a sale right now. Can't you see I'm hustling?"
When Jeremy starts shouting Zion's name, he could get some unexpected responses from the crowd. For example, he might shout "Zion!" and hear someone else shout back "Hey, that's my name too!" Or he might hear someone else shouting "I lost my phone!" and feel a moment of solidarity with them.
As Dave and his friends offer to help Jeremy find Zion, they could have a lighthearted banter among themselves that contrasts with Jeremy's frantic state. For example, Dave could say something like, "Alright team, let's fan out and search for the missing kid. And remember, if anyone asks, we're the search party and we're very official." The idea of a group of festival-goers taking on the role of a search party could be humorous in its own right.
