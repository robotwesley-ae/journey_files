my brain melted at DET

I want, personally, to be cautious when making judgements and not make them before considering things carefully. My initial reactions are:
you're a visionary with a great imagination and capacity for detailed plot
what size population could this be after considering the % of total audience who would buy into the ideas
[

this seems like something that would be tested using study groups

definitely. it would benefit from some product management work and surveys. it's still way too complicated. i have to lay it out

1 - ty. 2 = everyone 3 - the interesting thing is that the testing essentially happens in me doing it the first time i create the sanctuary system the right way, allowing others to see how to use it to create whatever system they want. theyre all mapped thru HJ which is for good guys not villains, so everyone wins
[

the reason i say that at 2
[
4:02 PM
]
is because firstly
[
4:03 PM
]
we have early adopters who are into narratives, impact, tech
[
4:03 PM
]
they become innovators. they use the system to create more applications of the system
[
4:03 PM
]
which are disguised as "their own systems"
[
4:03 PM
]
and they feel good about that
[
4:04 PM
]
so it allows the sanctuary system to be used to create products, where the product is the HJ for X
[
4:04 PM
]
i mean the sanctuary system for X
[
4:04 PM
]
in the language of "my journey of how i realized doing X can change the world and help us all win"

I would disagree with #2, there's going to be a small percentage of people who are presented the idea that get interested. That can be due to plenty of reasons from their ability to imagine, their past experiences, any particular bias, and more

It's going to sound great to some, and others would keep scrolling

absolutely 100% my point is that it can grow. it has evolution baked in
[
4:06 PM
]
so it isnt technically tied down to a specific niche
[
4:06 PM
]
it's like a meta-niche

have you ever seen Dan Kennedy's business, Magnetic Marketing? (edited)
[
4:07 PM
]
it's a marketing business that is also a marketing business factory. it makes marketing businesses for X, essentially (edited)
[
4:07 PM
]
this is the same idea, using the heros journey because the heros journey is directly relatable to customer journeys, funnels, personal growth, and societal progress
[
4:08 PM
]
in that sense, the sanctuary system factory churns out sanctuary systems for X, which are X's mapped to the heros journey via the sanctuary system and another domain specific language
[
4:09 PM
]
the language of X
