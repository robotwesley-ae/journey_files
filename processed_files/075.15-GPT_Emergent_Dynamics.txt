Okay. Letâ€™s say there is a plant psychedelic with therapeutic potential benefits. It stops pain completely when used at low doses in a therapeutic environment. What qualifications do I need to run experiments to validate this hypothesis? 

To run experiments with a plant-based psychedelic for therapeutic purposes, you will need to fulfill several requirements, including obtaining necessary qualifications, approvals, and permits. Here's a general outline of the steps you would need to take:

Obtain relevant education and training: Ideally, you should have a background in a relevant field, such as pharmacology, neuroscience, psychology, or medicine. A bachelor's degree in one of these fields is often a minimum requirement, but an advanced degree (e.g., a Ph.D. or M.D.) and research experience are strongly preferred.
Develop a research plan: Design a well-structured study that addresses your hypothesis and outlines the experimental methods, dosages, and protocols. This plan should also include information about the plant-based psychedelic's chemical composition, potential risks, and safety measures.
Collaborate with experienced researchers: If you do not possess the necessary qualifications or experience, consider partnering with researchers who have expertise in the field of psychedelics or therapeutics. Working with a team of experienced scientists can enhance the credibility of your research and help you navigate the regulatory process.
Obtain institutional support: Your research should be affiliated with a recognized institution, such as a university or a research organization. This institution will often provide resources, such as laboratory space and equipment, as well as help with the regulatory approval process.
Obtain necessary permits and approvals: Since psychedelic substances are often controlled substances, you will need to obtain the appropriate permits and licenses from the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) or other relevant government agencies. This may involve registering as a researcher and providing detailed information about your research plan.
Submit your study for ethical review: Research involving human subjects must be reviewed and approved by an Institutional Review Board (IRB) to ensure that the study complies with ethical guidelines and protects the rights and welfare of the participants.
Secure funding: Conducting research can be expensive, so you may need to secure funding from various sources, including government agencies, private foundations, or pharmaceutical companies.
Conduct the study and publish results: Once you have obtained all the necessary approvals and permits, you can proceed with your research. After completing the study, analyze the data, and publish your findings in a reputable scientific journal to share your results with the scientific community.
Please note that the regulations and requirements for conducting research with controlled substances can vary depending on the jurisdiction and the specific substance involved. Be sure to consult local regulations and guidelines and seek the advice of experienced professionals in the field to ensure compliance.

What if we just wanted to do the research? What kind of institution would we need and where would it need to be and who would need to join it (role wise)? 

To conduct research on a plant-based psychedelic with therapeutic potential, you would need to establish or join a research institution with appropriate facilities, resources, and personnel. Here are some key aspects to consider:

Type of institution: Research institutions can include universities, medical centers, or independent research organizations, as long as they have the appropriate infrastructure and resources to support your research.
Location: The institution should ideally be located in a country or region with favorable regulations and research policies related to controlled substances. Keep in mind that regulations may vary across jurisdictions, so it is essential to be familiar with local laws and guidelines.
