This is great, but can you add the following: "They need to get clothes so they hit the merch shop and the only things left are ridiculously expensive Rolling Loud outfits" because they are currently naked

Sure, here's a rewrite including the requested addition:
As Chad finishes his emotional story, Jeremy's phone rings, interrupting their conversation. It's a call from his wife, who's furious and yelling on the other end of the line. Apparently, Zion butt-dialed her, and she heard everything -- including his son's voice saying something about sneaking into the VIP section to meet a celebrity.
Jeremy's mind races as he tries to come up with a cover story. He tells his wife that Zion is right there with him.
His wife is skeptical but buys the story, and Jeremy breathes a sigh of relief. He turns to Chad, who's still giggling uncontrollably, and tells him they need to get into the VIP section.
Jeremy remembers the girls from earlier who had VIP bracelets and quickly pulls up Snapchat, hoping to find their usernames. After a few attempts, he succeeds and sends them a message, asking if they can help get him and Chad into the VIP section.
To kill time while waiting for a response, they head to the merch shop to find some clothes. But the only things left are ridiculously expensive Rolling Loud outfits. Jeremy grumbles as he hands over his credit card, but he knows it's worth it if it means finding Zion.
Finally, the girls respond to Jeremy's message and agree to meet them near the VIP entrance. Jeremy and Chad make their way there, feeling more confident now that they're dressed for the part.
As they approach the entrance, the girls spot them and wave them over. Jeremy and Chad flash their new VIP bracelets and follow the girls past the velvet rope.
Once inside, Jeremy's eyes dart around the room, searching for any sign of Zion. But all he sees are crowds of people, a sea of faces that blur together.
Suddenly, a commotion catches his attention. A group of fans are clamoring around a small stage, where a famous rapper is about to perform. Jeremy pushes his way through the crowd, hoping to catch a glimpse of Zion.
Chad follows close behind, still giggling and bouncing to the beat of the music. Together, they weave their way through the throngs of people, their eyes scanning the crowd for any sign of their son.
But as the night wears on and the music gets louder, Jeremy starts to feel a sense of hopelessness creep in. He wonders if he'll ever find Zion, or if he's lost him for good.

rewrite this: As they approach the VIP entranceâ€¦ The Snap Girls are nowhere to be found. Jeremy and Chad are pleading with security to let them in to VIP. Security says no. Chad decides to take one for the team and creates a distraction by sticking a glow stick up his butt and running around. As security tackles Chad, Jeremy sneaks into VIP.

As Jeremy and Chad approach the VIP entrance, they frantically scan the crowd for the Snap Girls, but they are nowhere to be found. Jeremy remembers that he added them on Snapchat and quickly pulls up the app to message them, hoping they can help him get into VIP.
Just as they're about to give up, the Snap Girls respond, saying they're on their way to the VIP entrance and to look for them. Jeremy and Chad start to panic as time ticks by, but finally, they spot the girls waving frantically at them from across the crowd.
As they approach the VIP entrance, Jeremy tries to use the girls' VIP bracelets to get in, but security isn't having it. They plead with the guards, but they won't budge.
Desperate, Jeremy remembers a booth selling Rolling Loud merchandise and drags Chad over to it. But to their dismay, the only items left are ridiculously expensive Rolling Loud outfits.
With no other options, they reluctantly shell out the money and change into the outfits, hoping they'll be enough to convince security to let them in.
But it's no use. The guards still won't let them in, and Jeremy's frustration reaches a boiling point. That's when Chad suggests he create a distraction.
