Zion jumps up and down with excitement, and Jeremy can't help but feel a surge of pride. He's not just protecting his son, he's giving him an experience he'll never forget.
They enter the festival, and the noise and energy wash over them. Jeremy's nervous, but he knows he has to keep it together for Zion's sake. They're in this together, and he'll do whatever it takes to keep his son safe.

This is what happened: (They turn him down and say “No one under 16 gets in.” Jeremy and Zion walk away and look for another entrance. Jeremy pulls Zion close and tells him that they have to just lie and say he’s sixteen. He grills him on how old he is. When he was born. What year in school he is, etc…” Zion can’t believe his father is lying like this. It’s crazy, but also new and cool. They approach the head security guard who asks for ID. Zion responds with “He left it at home.” the guy asks how old he is. I say 16. Zion says sixteen. The guy scrutinizes us, eyes him up and down, then nods us through.) Please rewrite this in a casual storytelling, cool style.

So there they were, Jeremy and Zion, standing in front of the entrance to Rolling Loud like a couple of lost puppies. The security guard took one look at Zion and shook his head, "No one under 16 gets in." Jeremy felt his heart sink. There was no way he was going to let his son down. Not now. Not ever.
He pulled Zion close and whispered in his ear, "We have to lie. Just go along with it, okay?" Zion was hesitant at first, but the thrill of the moment was too much to resist. They approached the head security guard who asked for ID. Jeremy said, "He left it at home."
The guy narrowed his eyes and asked, "How old are you?"
Zion took a deep breath and confidently replied, "Sixteen."
The guard scrutinized them for a moment, eyes running up and down Zion's small frame, but eventually he nodded and let them through. Jeremy breathed a sigh of relief, but he knew that the adventure was just beginning.

Great, but expand on the details of the scrutiny and all the answers that Zion and Jeremy prepped. Maybe one that they were unprepared for, but Zion pulls out a great answer, impressing himself and his father

Jeremy and Zion approach the head security guard, who looks at them suspiciously. He asks for their IDs, but Jeremy panics and tells him that they left them at home. The security guard looks at Zion and asks, "How old are you?" Zion takes a deep breath and confidently responds, "I'm sixteen."
The security guard narrows his eyes and scrutinizes Zion from head to toe. Jeremy and Zion had prepared for this moment and rehearsed every possible question the security guard might ask. But just when they think they're in the clear, the guard throws them a curveball.
"What year were you born?" he asks.
Jeremy freezes. They had never thought of this question. Zion looks at his father, nervous. But then, he remembers that he has a fake ID for when he sneaks into R-rated movies with his friends.
"Uh, 2005," Zion says confidently, pulling out the fake ID from his wallet.
The security guard studies it for a moment and then nods, letting them through. Zion looks at his father, amazed at how well they had prepared for this moment. Jeremy gives him a proud smile and pats him on the back, relieved that they had made it in.
