We could also have a series of videos called “why you shouldn’t X [common misconception from competing system]”
That's a great idea! Creating a series of videos debunking common misconceptions or addressing competing systems can be an effective way to differentiate your Sanctuary Writing system and demonstrate its value to viewers. Here are some tips to make these videos engaging and impactful:
Choose relevant and timely topics: Pick misconceptions or competing systems that are currently trending or widely discussed within your target audience. This will increase the likelihood that your videos will be discovered and viewed.
Be respectful and objective: Approach each topic with an open mind, and avoid any aggressive or derogatory language. Present your arguments in a clear and unbiased manner, and provide evidence to support your claims.
Offer a solution: After addressing the misconception or competing system, present the Sanctuary Writing system as an alternative solution. Explain how it overcomes the issues discussed in the video and how it can benefit the viewer.
Use visuals and examples: Incorporate visuals, such as diagrams or animations, to better illustrate your points. Provide real-life examples or case studies to make your content more relatable and engaging.
Keep it concise: Aim to keep your videos relatively short and focused on the main topic. Long and rambling videos can lose viewers' interest and reduce the overall impact of your message.
Encourage discussion: Invite viewers to share their thoughts and experiences related to the misconception or competing system in the comments section. This can foster a sense of community and engagement around your content.
