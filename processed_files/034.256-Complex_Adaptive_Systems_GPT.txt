Here's an outline of how this process could work:
Receive the user's prompt.
Use the AI model (e.g., GPT) to understand the prompt and extract the relevant information or queries.
Query the ontology using the extracted information to retrieve the required data or relationships.
Use the AI model to generate a response based on the retrieved data from the ontology.
This approach ensures that the AI model doesn't introduce new interpretations or information into the ontology, as it is solely responsible for understanding the prompt and generating responses. The ontology serves as a reliable source of domain knowledge that the AI model can query to provide accurate and relevant responses.
It is important to note that this approach still requires careful implementation and maintenance of the ontology, as well as fine-tuning and training of the AI model to effectively work with the ontology. However, it helps ensure that the AI model's output is consistent with the established domain knowledge, reducing the likelihood of generating incorrect or "hallucinated" responses.


That’s not really an instruction set on how to accomplish this entire task, given that I only have a word document now.
Apologies for any confusion. Let me provide you with a step-by-step process to accomplish this task, starting with a Word document.
Convert the Word document to a plain text format to make it easier for the AI to process.
Use an NLP tool, like spaCy or NLTK, to extract entities and relationships from the plain text. Save the extracted information in a structured format, such as JSON or CSV.
Use a tool like Protégé to create an OWL ontology based on the extracted entities and relationships. Define the classes, properties, and relationships in the ontology as needed.
Validate and refine the ontology in Protégé, checking for logical consistency and making any necessary adjustments.
Export the ontology from Protégé and import it into a graph database like Neo4j.
Develop a custom AI application that utilizes GPT and the Neo4j database. The application should be designed to:
a. Receive a user's prompt.
b. Use GPT to understand the prompt and extract relevant information or queries.
c. Query the Neo4j database, which contains the ontology, to retrieve required data or relationships.
d. Use GPT to generate a response based on the retrieved data from the Neo4j database.
Test the custom AI application with sample prompts to ensure that it is correctly utilizing the ontology and generating accurate responses.
Iterate and refine the AI application as needed, addressing any issues or limitations identified during testing.
Please note that this process assumes you have some experience with NLP tools, ontology creation, graph databases, and AI development. If you need more detailed instructions or guidance on specific tools or steps, feel free to ask.


Rewrite it for a beginner, understanding that I’ll need to consult GPT for help getting any code or installing any code related stuff
Here's a beginner-friendly version of the process, assuming you will consult GPT for help with code and installations:
Convert the Word document to a plain text format (.txt) to make it easier for the AI to process. You can do this by opening the document in Word, selecting "Save As," and choosing "Plain Text (.txt)" as the file format.
Use a natural language processing (NLP) tool like spaCy or NLTK to extract entities and relationships from the plain text. You will need to install the necessary libraries and follow a tutorial to get started. GPT can provide guidance on the installation process and example code.
Save the extracted information in a structured format, such as JSON or CSV. If you're not familiar with these formats, GPT can help you understand them and provide example code for saving your data.
Download and install Protégé, a free, open-source ontology editor. Follow a beginner's tutorial to learn how to create an OWL ontology based on the extracted entities and relationships.
Validate and refine the ontology in Protégé, checking for logical consistency and making any necessary adjustments. GPT can help you understand how to perform these tasks.
