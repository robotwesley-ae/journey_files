Here are a few examples of business-related ontologies and vocabularies:

GoodRelations Ontology: An ontology for e-commerce that covers products, services, prices, companies, and related aspects. GoodRelations has been integrated into schema.org, a collaborative vocabulary for structured data on the web.
Website: http://purl.org/goodrelations/
Financial Industry Business Ontology (FIBO): A comprehensive ontology for the financial industry, including banking, investments, and financial instruments.
Website: https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/
Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) Ontology: An ontology for representing business processes and workflows, based on the BPMN standard for business process modeling.
Website: http://www.bpmspace.com/BPMN_Ontology/
eCl@ss: A product classification standard that provides a hierarchical structure for products and services across industries. It can be used as a basis for a more specific business ontology.
Website: https://www.eclass.eu/
Organizational Ontology: A lightweight ontology for representing organizations, roles, and related concepts.
Website: http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-org/
You can use these ontologies as a starting point and customize them according to your specific needs or combine them to create a more comprehensive business ontology. WikiData and DBpedia can provide additional data and relationships to enrich your business ontology. You may also consider creating your own custom ontology for the business domain if existing resources do not fully meet your requirements.

Great so we need to meta-align all of those if they aren’t all aligned into RDF and cross-reasoned already 

Yes, to create a comprehensive and unified business ontology, you would need to align and integrate these various business ontologies and vocabularies. This process, often referred to as "ontology alignment" or "ontology mapping," involves identifying and establishing correspondences between the concepts, relationships, and axioms in the different ontologies.

Here are the steps to perform the meta-alignment and integration of these ontologies:

Convert the ontologies into a common format, if necessary. Most of the mentioned ontologies are already in RDF or OWL format, but you may need to convert others if they are in different formats.
Use ontology alignment and matching tools, such as AgreementMakerLight (AML), LogMap, or Python Record Linkage Toolkit, to find alignments between the ontologies. These tools will help you identify correspondences between entities, relationships, and axioms in the different ontologies.
Merge the aligned ontologies using a tool like Apache Jena or RDFLib. This step will involve resolving conflicts and inconsistencies, as well as combining the aligned entities and relationships into a single, unified ontology.
Optionally, enrich the integrated ontology with data from sources like WikiData or DBpedia. This can help provide additional context, relationships, and instances for the concepts in the unified business ontology.
Validate and refine the integrated ontology using an ontology editor like Protégé to ensure consistency and coherence.
Load the integrated ontology into a graph database like Neo4j using a library like py2neo, for efficient querying and analysis.
By performing this meta-alignment and integration process, you can create a comprehensive and unified business ontology that incorporates concepts and relationships from multiple existing ontologies and vocabularies. This integrated ontology can serve as a valuable resource for various applications, such as knowledge management, semantic search, and domain-specific reasoning.

Wouldn’t that business ontology enable a fine-tuned GPT array to accurately give itself tasks to perform the activities of a startup and actually generate value indefinitely?
