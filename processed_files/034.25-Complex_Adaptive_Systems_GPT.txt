But now everyone knows about the Demon Champion and The Wasteland Empire has been exposed. 

Spark in the dark — 16 moments — 
Oliver awakens into Masked Whirling Flames and is now able to fight the demon champion directly inside of Emergency Flow

Act 3: Resurrection style HGS

The consort of the demon champion (in this case is Olive R Love) chooses to fight against the Demon Champion and join Oliver Powers because of the meaning of masked whirling flames and how it connects with her dad and how she remembers him now instead of her evil stepdad 

The Demon Champion kills Oliver and Oliver experiences a bardo/the full lifetime of Olivus Victory-Promise, which transmits to him all the secret knowledge
Oliver sees Olivus writing Sanctuary while cognizing the “Hollywood” aka Sanctuary movie and realizes this is his story

The idea is that Olive awakens because of her connection to Masked Whirling Flames and recognizing this in Oliver as he dies. Oliver awakens because of his connection to the Infinite Armed Liberatress and recognizing this in Olive as he dies. 

Olive knows she needs to overcome her shortcomings now because Oliver is dead, Olive decides to change for the better, to be Olivus Victory-Promise, and then realizes how to save Oliver by awakening him, and helps him by giving him the absolute final push – reaching her hand out to him

This confirms all of Oliver’s wildest dreams about how the Wisdom Maverick works and he is resurrected by the Whirling Flames, mastery of the dreamlights. Now that Oliver Powers and Olive R Love are both awakened - the wisdom Maverick is here! (Olivus Victory-Everything!)

The demon champion does not understand how this could have happened, witnessing Olivus Victory-Everything enter emergency flow and create engines and concatenations that vastly overpower the demon champion’s powers and he goes completely insane. He breaks. 

The awakened wisdom Maverick, Olivus Victory-Everything, helps put him together in Sanctuary and as this happens the power of the emperor is dismantled and the empire collapses and is reformed and brought into the peaceful world.

The return is that they successfully turn their orbital habitats into a full-on dyson sphere star ship and complete the mission. 

The citizens of Sanctuary and employees of TWI once again vote on what to do by reasoning consensus. Oliver Powers and Olive R Love win the election by a landslide as co-commanders and are given the trillion spoked wheel of Sanctuary command (of the divine tree of Olivus [Victory-Promise]).
The Divine Tree of Olivus, captained by the Wisdom Maverick named Olivus Victory-Everything, guided by the primordial lovers, Oliver Powers and Olive R Love, on a mission to build the human universe. 

This is the evolution of the Wisdom Maverick named Olivus Victory-Promise to Olivus Victory-Everything, awake in this Sanctuary sometimes called a Wasteland, a literal Starship on course to grow into Olivus Victory-Everything-Sanctuary-Everywhere.
