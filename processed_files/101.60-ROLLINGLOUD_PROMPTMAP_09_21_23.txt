Kevin and Chad, in a state of pure bliss from their high, decide to chow down on some vegan food from a nearby truck. But little do they know, the food will come back to haunt them in a big way. As they walk away from the truck, their stomachs begin to rumble in unison.
They both realize they need to find a bathroom fast and make a beeline for the nearest portapotties. But as soon as they enter, they realize their mistake. The smell is overwhelming, and the conditions are beyond disgusting. Kevin starts to feel sick and quickly sits down on the toilet, hoping for some relief. But as he's sitting there, he hears a noise from the adjacent portapotty.
It's Chad, who's also suffering from the same fate. But as they commiserate about their predicament, they suddenly hear the sound of the door locking. They try to open the door, but it won't budge. They're stuck.
As they wait for someone to come to their rescue, they start to feel worse and worse. The heat inside the portapotty is unbearable, and their stomachs are churning. Just when they think things can't get any worse, they hear a group of kids outside laughing and taunting them. The kids had locked the doors from the outside as a prank.
Kevin and Chad panic, feeling like they're trapped in a nightmare. They desperately search for a way out, but the only option is to climb out through the roof. They have to work together to boost each other up and out, all while trying not to get sick on each other.
As they finally emerge from the portapotties, they're covered in filth and feeling worse than ever. They stumble out into the festival, trying to find a place to clean up and recover. But they can't shake the feeling of embarrassment and humiliation from their ordeal.

Let's build on this concept for a sequence: The festival jail: After Chad's distraction stunt, he and Jeremy both end up in festival jail. But when they're locked up with a group of rowdy festival-goers, they have to find a way to blend in and avoid getting beat up.

As they enter festival jail, Jeremy and Chad are immediately intimidated by the rowdy group of festival-goers they're locked up with. The group is made up of mostly beefy dudes covered in tattoos and wearing bandanas, who start sizing up the newcomers as soon as they enter the cell.
Jeremy and Chad know they need to find a way to blend in or risk getting beaten up. Chad suggests they act tough and pretend like they're part of a rival gang. Jeremy is skeptical but goes along with it, putting on his best tough guy face.
As they approach the group, Chad tries to strike up a conversation, but they're not buying it. The group leader, a hulking man with a shaved head, starts to square up to them.
Just as things are about to turn violent, Jeremy notices a familiar face across the cell. It's one of the girls from earlier who had VIP bracelets, and she's giving him a sly smile.
With a newfound sense of confidence, Jeremy approaches her and strikes up a conversation. As they talk, he learns that she's part of a secret society of festival-goers who operate under the radar, known as the "Roaming Ravers."
As Jeremy listens in awe, he realizes that he and Chad need to join the Roaming Ravers if they want to survive festival jail. With the help of their new friends, they hatch a plan to break out of jail and blend in with the crowd.
In a wild sequence, they distract the guards with a makeshift rave in the cell, complete with glow sticks, strobe lights, and booming bass. As the guards are distracted, they slip away and join the Roaming Ravers.
From there, they spend the rest of the night partying with the group, experiencing the festival in a way they never thought possible. But as the night comes to a close, they realize they still haven't found Zion, and their euphoria turns to despair.

Why are they arrested and taken to festival jail?
ChatGPT
They are arrested and taken to festival jail because Chad's distraction stunt attracts the attention of festival security, who mistake him for a rowdy festival-goer and tackle him to the ground. Jeremy tries to intervene, but he too is caught up in the chaos and is also arrested.
