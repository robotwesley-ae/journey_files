The execution environment does not have access to the file system outside of the working directory, so the script cannot create directories at arbitrary paths like /path/to/folder. Let's correct the path to use the working directory /mnt/data. The function chunk_and_save_text can remain largely the same, although it does assume text input which we don't currently have. The upload_folder_to_google_drive function won't work without actual Google API setup, so I've left it as a mock for the illustration.
Here is the revised script without the execution of file system dependent functions:
