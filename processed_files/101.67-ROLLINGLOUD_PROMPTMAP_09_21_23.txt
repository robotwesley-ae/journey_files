rewrite the following but eliminate redundancy: Kevin rushes up to the receptionist in the security room, frantically explaining that his son is missing. The receptionist begins taking down the report. RECEPTIONIST What's your son's age? Just as Kevin is about to answer, the security guard who eventually let them in enters the room. Feeling the pressure, Kevin decides to stick to the lie. KEVIN He's 16. As the words leave his mouth, the first security guard who had rejected them earlier walks into the room, raising an eyebrow. FIRST SECURITY GUARD Really now? Because earlier, you told me he was 13. Which one is it? Kevin's face turns red with embarrassment, realizing he's caught in a lie. He takes a deep breath and decides to come clean. KEVIN Alright, alright, he's 13. I just wanted my son to have a good time. But now he's missing, and I'm terrified. Please, I need your help to find him. The first security guard scoffs, clearly unimpressed. FIRST SECURITY GUARD You committed a violation of Section 273a of the Penal Code by providing false information and willfully placing your child in a situation where his health and safety could be compromised. KEVIN Come on. I just wanted him to enjoy the festival. As Kevin challenges them, the guards become increasingly offended. SECOND SECURITY GUARD It is serious. You put your son in danger and broke the rules. KEVIN Look, I get it, but right now, we need to find my son. Kevin feels embarrassed and defensive as the security guard grills him about his parenting choices. He explains that he didn't realize there was an age restriction and that he just wanted to bond with his son over their shared love of music. The security guard isn't convinced, and Kevin can feel himself getting angrier by the second. "Look, I don't have time for this," Kevin snaps. "My son is missing, and I need your help to find him." The security guard seems taken aback by Kevin's sudden outburst. He realizes that this is a serious situation and that he needs help. He radios his colleagues and asks them to keep an eye out for a lost 13-year-old boy. The first security guard, fed up with Kevin's attitude, raises his voice. FIRST SECURITY GUARD Cuff him! The two security guards move to cuff Kevin. In a desperate move, Kevin pushes one of them aside and manages to slip away, running back into the festival crowd. His heart races, knowing he's now a wanted man, but his primary focus remains on finding his son.
