Rewrite the following in FDX in the style of Todd Phillips: As Kevin and Shenseea approach the Playbus, Shenseea whispers to him, "Pretend like you're packing a water gun." Kevin's heart starts racing, but he nods in agreement. He's not sure why Shenseea wants him to do this, but he trusts her. As they near the entrance of the bus, Kevin awkwardly puts his hand in his pocket, mimicking the shape of a gun. Shenseea flashes a smile at the bodyguards, who eye Kevin suspiciously, but then seem to relax as they see his hand in his pocket.

As Kevin and Shenseea inch their way towards the carnival-esque Playbus, Shenseea's voice dips into a hushed whisper, almost lost amidst the commotion, "Play it as if you're packing a squirt gun." A sudden adrenaline surge paints Kevin's veins, his heart pounding in his chest like a desperate drummer, yet he only nods in silent acquiescence. His understanding of Shenseea's strange request might be opaque, but his faith in her is crystalline clear.
Gradually, the bus's entrance looms before them, its door appearing as a gateway to some wild, uncharted territory. With an air of feigned nonchalance, Kevin slides his hand into his pocket, awkwardly attempting to form the outline of a firearm. His movements are noticed by Shenseea who flashes a quick, mischievous grin towards the burly sentinels guarding the door. Their eyes, filled with initial suspicion, scrutinize Kevin, but relax into an unnerved calm as they notice his hand tucked into his pocket.
