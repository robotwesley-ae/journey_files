These plans provide a high-level workflow to perform each task. Each of these can also be broken down into granular tasks for greater detail and specificity. Proper execution of all these steps will give us a robust and comprehensive strategy to position omnipresent multimorphic AI agents in the market. In this fulfilling journey of baking a new product, amendments and iterations will add to its flavour and refinement. And... that's a wrap!  (edited)

@Tonic bro do u see how these personas work? bizzibee HIVE notation is for making complex workflows. if u load in ur project contexts, i can help u mine literally every single step and we can plan huuuuge stuff with these boys. i just need some help getting the data pipelines straight cuz idk how to code and make that shit. u get me? we can pipe the answers into spreadsheets, metacog them and send them thru ontology filter layers of speadsheets and then formulaically respond to queries while automatically ontologizing them. then pipe htat shit to a vectorDB and save the workflows for later use. these guys can do crazy shit. theyre just stuck hallucinating in this garbage setup, but if we have the ability to pull the good stuff from responses successively and assemble the perfect answer step by step ontologically while we also record it we can even use blockchain like eth just to do the processing lmfao. we have them compile answers to the block and it's mined when it's complete and ontologized to some degree. then everything is referrable because we can tag it with additional keyIDs and built successive layers.
