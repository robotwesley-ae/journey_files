 radial coordinates, while the angular coordinates (θ, φ) remain unchanged.
Combine the spatial and quaternion components: One possible approach is to represent the spatial part of the Kruskal-Szekeres coordinates (U, V) using quaternions. This would involve finding a suitable mapping between the U and V coordinates and the b, c, and d components of a quaternion. The time component (θ, φ) would remain separate.
Address the properties and transformations: Investigate how the properties and transformations associated with the Kruskal-Szekeres coordinates (such as the removal of the coordinate singularity) can be incorporated into the quaternion representation. This may involve modifying the quaternion multiplication rules, devising new quaternion functions, or introducing additional mathematical structures.
Test the new representation: Once the extended quaternion representation has been developed, test its mathematical properties and applicability to problems in general relativity. This may involve solving equations of motion, examining spacetime geometries, or investigating the behavior of particles and fields in the new coordinate system.
Please note that this is a speculative idea, and developing such a representation would likely require a significant amount of mathematical research and innovation. The feasibility and usefulness of combining quaternions with Kruskal-Szekeres coordinates remain open questions.


Or could we have one 3D view made of the quaternion coordinate system and then another 4D view where the black holes are made visible by using a Kruskal-szkeres coordinate system?
Yes, it's possible to create two separate visualizations, one using a quaternion-based coordinate system and another using the Kruskal-Szekeres coordinate system, to represent different aspects of the spacetime geometry.
The quaternion-based visualization could provide a 3D representation of the spacetime, focusing on the spatial aspects and rotations. Quaternions are particularly useful for representing 3D rotations and orientations, and their properties could be exploited to create an intuitive visualization of the spatial features.
The Kruskal-Szekeres coordinate system visualization would provide a 4D view of the spacetime, with an emphasis on the structure near black holes. By removing the coordinate singularity at the event horizon, the Kruskal-Szekeres coordinates allow for a clearer representation of the black hole's properties and the spacetime geometry in its vicinity.
By having these two separate visualizations, you can gain different insights into the spacetime geometry and the behavior of particles and fields within it. Users could switch between the views or examine them side-by-side to better understand the relationships between the different coordinate systems and the underlying physical phenomena.


Does this actually make sense though?
My previous response might have been unclear. Using both quaternions and Kruskal-Szekeres coordinates together in the same visualization would be challenging, as they serve different purposes and are not directly compatible.
Quaternions are primarily used for representing 3D rotations and orientations, while Kruskal-Szekeres coordinates are designed to describe the geometry of spacetime near a black hole in general relativity. These two concepts are quite different in nature and application.
However, it is still possible to create separate visualizations for each of these concepts, allowing you to gain insights into different aspects of the spacetime. But combining them into a single visualization may not be feasible, as the two coordinate systems describe different aspects of the physical phenomena and are not directly interchangeable.
So, while it's possible to create visualizations for both quaternion-based rotations and Kruskal-Szekeres coordinates independently, trying to combine them into a single, unified visualization might not be practical or provide additional insights into the spacetime geometry.


But you remember we are talking about the spacetime inside crystal ball
