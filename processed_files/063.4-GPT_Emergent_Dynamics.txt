The text presents a complex set of ideas related to non-contradictory systems, abstraction hallucinations, and game theory concepts like Nash equilibrium and emergent dynamics. The formalizations provided in first-order logic and game-theoretic notation attempt to clarify the relationships and concepts presented in the text.

While the formalizations help to make the arguments more explicit, the text may still benefit from further clarification and elaboration. Some of the terms and concepts used in the text might not be widely understood or could be subject to different interpretations. Providing definitions and examples for these terms and concepts could help make the text more accessible and easier to understand.

Moreover, the arguments and claims made in the text may be subject to critique or further exploration. For example, the relationship between a non-contradictory system and game theory concepts like Nash equilibrium and emergent dynamics might require additional justification or evidence. Additionally, the text could benefit from a clearer explanation of how a non-contradictory system addresses abstraction hallucinations and their effects on reasoning or decision-making processes.

In conclusion, the text presents an intricate set of ideas and relationships that might benefit from further elaboration, clarification, and exploration. The formalizations provided help to make the arguments more explicit, but alternative interpretations or critiques could arise based on different assumptions, premises, or language.

Can you help revise the formalizations to accomplish the goals of the paper? 

To better assist you with revising the formalizations, I will first need to clarify the goals of the paper. Based on the information provided, it seems the paper aims to:

Investigate the relationship between non-contradictory systems, abstraction hallucinations, and game theory concepts like Nash equilibrium and emergent dynamics.
Argue that a non-contradictory system is beneficial for resolving paradoxical syllogisms and addressing abstraction hallucinations.
Explore how a non-contradictory system interacts with game theory concepts to produce beneficial outcomes for the group.
With these goals in mind, I will provide revised formalizations that attempt to make the arguments and relationships more explicit, while still highlighting the potential for alternative interpretations or critiques. Note that this revision will not necessarily address all possible critiques or alternative representations, but rather aims to provide a clearer starting point for further exploration and discussion.

Define the relationship between non-contradictory systems, Nash equilibrium, and emergent dynamics:
Non-contradictory system: NCS
Nash equilibrium: NE
Emergent dynamics: ED
Game variation: GV
Non-contradictory systems and Nash equilibrium:
NE ⇒ NCS
ED ⇒ ¬NE
GV ⇒ NE
Define the relationship between non-contradictory systems, paradoxical syllogisms, and abstraction hallucinations:
Paradoxical syllogism: PS
Abstraction hallucination: AH
Myopia: M
Hyperopia: H
Non-contradictory systems and paradoxical syllogisms:
NCS ⇒ ¬PS
Non-contradictory systems and abstraction hallucinations:
NCS ⇒ ¬AH
Myopia and hyperopia as types of abstraction hallucinations:
M ⇒ AH
H ⇒ AH
Define the relationship between non-contradictory systems, self-interest, and beneficial outcomes for the group:
Strict self-interest: SI
Beneficial for group: BG
Non-contradictory systems, self-interest, and beneficial outcomes:
NCS ∧ ∀x SI(x) ⇒ BG
These revised formalizations focus on the relationships between non-contradictory systems, game theory concepts, and abstraction hallucinations, while providing a clearer connection to the goals of the paper. Keep in mind that this revision is only one possible interpretation of the text, and other interpretations or critiques might arise based on different assumptions, premises, or language. Further exploration and discussion of these ideas will likely be necessary to fully address the goals of the paper.

It’s interesting to think of non-contradictory systems as a type of emergent collapse
