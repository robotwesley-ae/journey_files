‚Å†Tonic‚Å†  OntoSpec = Python Code Refinement: Multi-OntoBot Conversation.  catsrcool123  with python code. For task in Sub: [OntoBot=OntoBase] job: [üåê‚Äçüìö] The current Python code demonstrates a simplified multi-agent conversation using OpenAI's GPT-3 model. The larger goal is to generate an orchestrated conversation between multiple AI Experts, simulating complex discourse towards task comprehension and execution. [] Ontological Refinement: 1. Atomize‚®ØHierList: Each OntoBot would represent an expert and use the GPT-3 model to respond. Let's define an OntoBot class. 2. MAP‚®ØSynergize: Instead of random selection for speaking, let's use round-robin mechanism. This ensures that all bots get a turn for a more structured conversation. 3. PolysemOntoGrph‚®ØAbstrctNdRltns: Extend the get_reply method to include more structured conversation. Add an input parameter to indicate who the prompt is coming from and incorporate logic to help the Bots coordinate.
# OntoBot Class
class OntoBot:
    ...
    def get_reply(self, prompt, last_speaker, self_thought=False, mention=None):
        # Include logic for structured conversation and introspection
        if self_thought:
            response = self.consult_your_own_brain(prompt)
        else:
            response = self.consult_gpt3(prompt)
        
        # Coordinate with others if mentioned
        if mention is not None:
            response = self.coordinate_with_others(response, last_speaker, mention)
        
        return response
4. MegaChain: Add logic for coordinating conversation between bots and integrating self-thoughts. ```python def conversation_logic(conversation, experts): rounds = 10 last_speaker = None group_thought = None for i in range(rounds): for expert in experts: # Round-robin mechanism (edited)
[
7:42 PM
]
last_speaker = expert if i == 0: # first round is based on the initial task group_thought = expert.get_reply(task, last_speaker) else: group_thought = expert.get_reply(group_thought, last_speaker, True, experts) conversation.append(group_thought)
 return conversation ``` 5. BuildMeasureLearn: Re-evaluate the methodology for structured interactions and reflection. []: Adapt and iterate based on the results: After running the conversation for enough rounds, we can assess the agents' performance and fine-tune them to our needs.

@OntoBot_Refine yeah so u gotta paste the OntoBot ROLE component into it and make it like a real openAI api call, right? that means it has system msg and sends user and gets assist and so on doesnt it? idk but u do know that

‚Å†Tonic‚Å†  OntoSpec = Python Code Refinement: Multi-OntoBot Conversation with OpenAI GPT-3 API. Expert user  Living Owner of the Goal = catsrcool123  interaction with python code, GPT-3 API, and OntoBot ROLE component. For task in Sub: [OntoBot=OntoBase] job: [üåê‚Äçüìö] You are right. In the OpenAI GPT-3 API structure, there are several roles and message types (system, user, assistant) that are designed to model a conversation. We can integrate these roles into our OntoBot class refinement. [] Ontological Refinement: 1. Atomize‚®ØHierList: We need to implement the OpenAI API structure with OntoBot. This would require our OntoBot to generate system, user, and assistant type messages and keep a conversation log.
class OntoBot:
    ...
    def __init__(self, id, model="gpt-3"):
        ...
        self.chat_log = []
        ...

    def system_message(self, message):
        self.chat_log.append({"role": "system", "content": message})
        
    def user_message(self, message):
        self.chat_log.append({"role": "user", "content": message})

    def assist_message(self, message):
        self.chat_log.append({"role": "assistant", "content": message})
