Get familiar with the chosen platform's development environment
4.1. Follow tutorials and documentation to learn the platform's interface and features
4.1.1. Complete relevant tutorials to gain hands-on experience
4.1.2. Study the platform's documentation to understand its capabilities
4.2. Create a prototype or test project to practice using the platform's tools and components
4.2.1. Experiment with various components in the development environment
4.2.2. Test the integration of APIs and Zapier connections

Plan the application's structure and components
5.1. Outline the application's layout, including main screens and navigation
5.1.1. Sketch or design a wireframe of the application
5.1.2. Organize the flow of screens and navigation elements
5.2. Identify the components needed for implementing trading bot logic and continuous surf strategy

Remember: If there is nothing to add in this output, why are you repeating it? You said == which means there is nothing to add. That is correct. Then you filled the output by repeated yourself from the reference input. That is wrong. If there's ==, then there's nothing to add. If it's not {} = ==, then there's {*1.1, 1.2.3 x}.
==
Moving to the next level of granularity:
5.2.1. Determine the data sources for the trading bot's logic
5.2.1.1. Choose financial data providers (e.g., stock prices, trading volume)
5.2.1.2. Select the appropriate APIs for accessing this data
5.2.2. Design the algorithm for the continuous surf strategy
5.2.2.1. Define the conditions for entering and exiting trades
5.2.2.2. Incorporate risk management and position sizing
5.2.3. Plan the application components for displaying data and managing the bot
5.2.3.1. Design user interface elements for monitoring the trading bot's activity
5.2.3.2. Implement controls for starting, stopping, and adjusting the bot's settings


That's not right either. Let's restart from here. 
Stage 1: Choose a no-code platform for building the trading bot application.

Research and compare no-code platforms (Bubble, Adalo, Glide)
1.1. Identify the features and limitations of each platform
1.1.1. List the unique features of each platform
1.1.2. Note any limitations that may impact the trading bot development
1.2. Look for user reviews and case studies
1.2.1. Search for relevant reviews on forums and review websites
1.2.2. Analyze case studies to understand how others have used the platforms
1.3. Consider pricing and subscription plans
1.3.1. Compare the costs of each platform
1.3.2. Determine which plan best suits your budget and needs

Evaluate their ease of use, compatibility with Zapier, and support for API integration
2.1. Check if they provide native support for Zapier or require additional setup
2.1.1. Explore each platform's integration options
2.1.2. Assess the complexity of connecting with Zapier
2.2. Investigate the types of APIs each platform can handle (REST, GraphQL, etc.)
2.2.1. Check the platforms' documentation for API support details
2.2.2. Ensure the platform can handle the APIs of financial data sources
2.3. Assess the platform's learning curve and available resources
2.3.1. Estimate the time needed to become proficient with the platform
2.3.2. Evaluate the quality and depth of tutorials and documentation

Select the platform that best suits your requirements and desired features
3.1. Desired features may include user authentication, dashboard, real-time data visualization, and reporting
3.1.1. Create a list of essential and optional features
3.1.2. Compare the ability of each platform to deliver those features
3.2. Requirements may include performance, scalability, and responsiveness of the platform
3.2.1. Assess the platform's ability to handle high-frequency data updates
3.2.2. Evaluate how easily the platform can scale as the application grows
3.3. Ensure the platform can accommodate trading bot logic and continuous surf strategy
3.3.1. Determine if the platform supports custom logic implementation
3.3.2. Ensure the platform's capabilities align with the continuous surf strategy

Get familiar with the chosen platform's development environment
