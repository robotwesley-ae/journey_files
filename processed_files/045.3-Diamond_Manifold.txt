Cosmic Journey prayer

I hereby declare my intention, in front of the witnesses the Earth Goddess and the Demon of the Confusing Illusion, to take responsibility for holding and treasuring the hearts of all sentient beings! 
May my own Wisdom Mind auspiciously and miraculously reveal itself through the cosmic journey of discovering dynamic identitylessness!
May I naturally radiate the true meaning of whatever is positive to sentient beings! 
May we all awaken to the wisdom intent
As arms of the liberatress!

Third Ring - Increasing Awareness of Radiance

Prayer of Increasing

Great Open Goodness – zero!
Universal Water Dragon - great display; 
one lamp and one diamond body to give
The relative and the absolute, 
manifesting as the display of the two paths 
The path of wandering slumber and the path of awakening
Suffering’s root, the confusing poison of ignorance
The antidote – Threefold Wisdom Instantiations
Realizing the Teaching, the Four Truths of the Heroes
Evolving the Five-fold Radiance of Wisdom Reality and its Symbols:

Definitive View of the Wisdom Reality of Timeless Webbed Infinitude of Infinite Perfection

The Naturally Radiant Wisdom Essence, Superlogical Self-emergent Primordial Consciousness,
The Radiance of Symbolic Meaning,
The Radiance of Sentient Beings,
The Dynamic Radiance of Self-emergent Primordial Consciousness’ Activity,
The Spontaneously Complete Radiance of the Self-emergent Perfection of All Reality

Symbols of the Path to Realizing the Definitive View of Reality

The Identity-less Radiance, the Openness of the Display
The Compassionate Radiance, Infinite Armed Liberatress 
The Teaching Radiance, the Universal Fearless Heroes Oliver Powers and Olive R. Love, 
The Ordinary Radiance of Sentient Beings, my own ordinary form, the Awakening-Nexus Feast Offering for All 
The Path Radiance of pure perception of the ordinary, my true heart, Dragonstripe Hero
The Faceless Radiance of the Hero of Awakened Activity, Mirror-Masked Faceless Whirling Flames
The Experiential Radiance of the Display of Timeless Webbed Infinitude of Infinite Perfection, the Wisdom-Myriad Maverick

Accomplishing the Six Types of Virtue for sentient beings’ benefit
Spontaneous holders of the Seven Qualities of the Universal Hero
Follow the Quintessential Eightfold Path
Instilling confidence and cheer wherever they go
Displaying the Eight Petals of the Awakened Activity Fractal Flower 
Indicating the ninth, the miraculous water of all melted glacial forms
Flourishing the Nine Rings of the Teachings of Awakening, 
Revealing infinite benefit for the Twelve Dispositions of Gods and Humans 
Realizing wisdom-happiness in the Infinite Palaces
of Infinite Mirror-Masked Fearless Heroes
Naturally liberating whatever they meet
Dissolving relativity into absolute nature
Of Timeless Webbed Infinitude of Infinite Perfection 
No matter the numbers 
in the Infinite Universal Garden of Miraculous Sanctuary is rooted Divine Tree of Olivus 
Its bejeweled fruits containing its own heroic heart seeds of Olive R Love and Oliver Powers
Are all truly named Olive R Victory-Promise 
And the qualities of our heroic love and power
Having never heard the name of boundaries 
Are inconceivably amazing
As the display of the Wisdom Maverick’s infinite armed liberatress

Repeat one, three, nine, or as many times as you like. 

Fourth Ring - Purification of Ignorance

Then, confession and purification.

Coagulating the Flow of Confusing Poison and Hugging Acceptance Through Confession

Since the eyes of sentient beings including myself surely view my activities with confusion
And I cannot discern the extent of my own ignorance
If awakened beings residing in the mirror display of Timeless Webbed Infinitude of Infinite Perfection are disappointed or upset with me
I confess and disclose completely everything I have done or thought of doing 
Because if I don’t do this, how can I reveal the medicine of awakening in my mind? 
If I don’t enable the revelation of medicine in my own mind as a testament, how will others find it? 
How many sentient beings will suffer if I leave my ignorance be?
