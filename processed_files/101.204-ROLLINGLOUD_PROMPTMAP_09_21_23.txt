 in the distance.
SECOND SECURITY GUARD Hey, we need backup over there! Let's go!
The head security guard's attention is diverted, his focus shifting from Kevin and Zion to the unfolding commotion. With a dismissive wave, he gestures for them to move along.
HEAD SECURITY GUARD Alright, just go. But remember, no fooling around.
Kevin and Zion exchange a quick glance, relief washing over them. They step past the guard, their hearts pounding with a mix of exhilaration and apprehension. The journey isn't over, but they've cleared a major hurdle.
KEVIN We made it, buddy. We're in!
Zion's face lights up, a mixture of joy, excitement, and a touch of disbelief. Kevin's pride swells, knowing that he's not only given his son a chance to experience something extraordinary but also shown him the importance of resilience and determination.
They walk further into the festival grounds, fully immersing themselves in the pulsating energy and vibrant ambiance. As the music engulfs them and the crowd envelops them, they embrace the adventure that lies ahead, ready to create memories that will last a lifetime.
FADE OUT.

INT. ROLLING LOUD VENUE - DAY
Relieved that they've managed to avoid a potentially dangerous situation, Kevin and Zion quickly move away from the chaotic scene. Zion looks up at his dad with disappointment in his eyes, his youthful spirit dampened by the realization that he won't be able to experience the festival. Kevin's heart aches as he sees his son's disappointment, determined to find a way to make things right.
Kevin pulls Zion close, their heads almost touching, and whispers in a hushed tone.
KEVIN We have to lie and say you're sixteen.
Zion's face tenses up, a mix of uncertainty and hesitation evident in his expression. He takes a deep breath, preparing himself for what lies ahead.
ZION But Dad, my birthday is July 18th, 2009. That means I'm only thirteen.
Kevin's brows furrow as he contemplates the situation. He knows they need a plan, even if it involves bending the truth.
KEVIN I know, buddy. Just for today, we're going to practice saying your date of birth as three years earlier. It's our secret, okay?
Zion looks at his dad, a mixture of concern and determination in his eyes.
ZION Okay, Dad. I trust you.
Kevin smiles, a hint of guilt lingering beneath his determined expression.
KEVIN Remember, puff out your chest a little, look confident. And just be yourself, bud.
Zion takes another deep breath, steeling himself for the upcoming challenge. He straightens his posture and nods, ready to take on the role.
ZION I got this, Dad.
They continue their journey through the bustling festival grounds, passing vibrant stages, food stalls, and a sea of excited concert-goers. The atmosphere is electric, the air buzzing with anticipation and the thumping beats of the music. As they approach a different entrance manned by a fresh set of security guards, Kevin prepares himself for the pivotal moment.
Zion steps up to the head security guard, who scrutinizes him with a stern gaze. The guard's eyes narrow, questioning Zion's legitimacy.
HEAD SECURITY GUARD IDs, please.
Zion looks at the guard with a determined expression, his voice steady and self-assured.
ZION I left mine at home, but I'm sixteen. I promise.
The guard's eyes shift to Kevin, seeking confirmation. Kevin's heart races, knowing that one wrong move could shatter their chances. He responds quickly, striving to match Zion's confidence.
KEVIN Absolutely. He's sixteen.
The guard's gaze lingers on them, skepticism etched on his face. He decides to test their story further.
HEAD SECURITY GUARD Alright, what year were you born?
Kevin's mind races, trying to recall the year that aligns with their fabricated story. He takes a moment to compose himself before responding.
KEVIN (insert year, sounding uncertain but hopeful)
