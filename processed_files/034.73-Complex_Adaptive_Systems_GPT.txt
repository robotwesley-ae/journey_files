Right so Malakarâ€™s demon champion journey of self-sacrifice in the feast experience offering is getting worse and worse as he proliferates extremely wrathful sanctuary around himself in the form of Alex becoming Olivus Victory-Everything in order to mirror his power and show him identitylessness
Yes, that's a fitting interpretation of the story in the context of Sanctuary. As Malakar's journey as a demon champion progresses, his actions inadvertently lead to the proliferation of extremely wrathful Sanctuary around him. This manifests in the form of Alex becoming Olivus Victory-Everything, a powerful force that mirrors Malakar's own strength and exposes the ultimate truth of identitylessness.
In this way, Malakar's self-sacrifice in the feast experience offering intensifies as he struggles against his own ignorance and attachment. The story becomes an allegory for the transformative power of Sanctuary, as it demonstrates how even the most destructive and chaotic forces can be used to reveal profound wisdom and loving-kindness.
By confronting Malakar with the truth of identitylessness through the mirrored power of Olivus Victory-Everything, Alex and the Sanctuary principles serve as a catalyst for Malakar's potential transformation. This dynamic interplay between Malakar and Alex highlights the co-emergent nature of the Sanctuary system and the potential for growth and change inherent in every individual, regardless of their current state.


Ok embellish the story events and details so it illustrates more Sanctuary system principles and dynamics step by step, starting with Act 1 only.
Act 1:
In the distant future, humanity has colonized space and lives among various alien species. While many have embraced the principles of Sanctuary, there are still those who cling to their destructive ways, proliferating the Wasteland across the universe. Malakar, a powerful and feared demon champion, leaves destruction in his wake as he seeks to expand his own power and influence.
As Act 1 unfolds, we are introduced to a young woman named Alex, who is training to become a Sanctuary coach under the tutelage of her mentor, a wise and experienced heroic individual named Master Tranquil. Alex is a gifted practitioner of the Wisdom of Identitylessness (TWI) and is particularly drawn to the practice of Daring Illusory Play. Master Tranquil recognizes her potential and focuses on cultivating her skills in this area, teaching her how to utilize emergent engines called Miraculous Teachings to transform demon champions into heroes.
In the meantime, Malakar's relentless path of destruction catches the attention of Alex and Master Tranquil. They learn of his terrifying presence through the stories of refugees and survivors who have managed to escape his wrath. Seeing an opportunity to put her skills to the test, Alex convinces Master Tranquil to allow her to confront Malakar and attempt to show him the truth of identitylessness.
Act 1 ends with Alex setting off on her journey to confront Malakar, guided by the principles of Sanctuary and the teachings of her mentor. Her mission is to use her understanding of Daring Illusory Play and the emergent engines of Miraculous Teachings to create an experience so profound that it will force Malakar to confront the emptiness of his own existence and the futility of his actions. This act serves to establish the central conflict of the story and provides a strong foundation for the exploration of Sanctuary principles and dynamics in the acts to come.
