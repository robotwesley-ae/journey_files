 By doing so, they can create more accurate representations of the super-specific polysemic phrase and its relationships with other tokens in various linguistic programs.

Why would the embedding need to capture the relationships beforehand in order to find them as nearest neighbor outputs? That seems like you just made math explode.
I apologize if my previous response was confusing. You are correct that embeddings don't need to capture all the relationships beforehand in order to find them as nearest neighbor outputs.
Embeddings are, in essence, a way to represent words in a vector space, making it possible to perform mathematical operations and find similarities between them. When you have a polysemic phrase, the embeddings should ideally represent its various meanings in the vector space. Nearest neighbor outputs can then be found based on the similarities between the embeddings, allowing you to identify related tokens in the context of the specific meaning you are interested in.
The relationships between embeddings are not predetermined, but rather, they emerge from the training process, where the model learns to represent words in a way that captures their semantic and syntactic relationships. It's through this learning process that embeddings are formed, which can then be used to find nearest neighbors and other relationships.
The more advanced models like BERT, ELMo, and GPT can handle polysemy better because they consider context when generating embeddings. They don't necessarily have all the relationships built-in beforehand, but they learn to create contextually relevant embeddings that can be used to find relationships, even in the case of polysemic phrases.

Can you give me a step-by-step example, using the phrase "because of what it is, there's a way this all goes"?
Sure! I'll use this phrase in the context of generating word embeddings and finding nearest neighbors. Here is a step-by-step example:
Tokenization: First, you'll need to tokenize the phrase into separate words or subwords, depending on the tokenizer being used. In our case, the tokens would be: ['because', 'of', 'what', 'it', 'is', ',', 'there', 'is', 'a', 'way', 'this', 'all', 'goes'].
Obtain Pre-trained Embeddings: To generate embeddings, you can use a pre-trained model like word2vec, GloVe, or a more advanced model like BERT, ELMo, or GPT. These models have been trained on large corpora of text and have learned to represent words or tokens in a high-dimensional vector space.
Generate Embeddings: Pass each token in the tokenized phrase through the chosen pre-trained model to obtain the embeddings for each token. These embeddings are high-dimensional vectors representing each word or token in the phrase.
Calculate Similarities: For each token's embedding, you can calculate the similarity with other embeddings in the pre-trained model's vocabulary. Common similarity measures include cosine similarity or Euclidean distance.
Find Nearest Neighbors: Based on the similarity scores, identify the nearest neighbors for each token in the phrase. The nearest neighbors are the tokens with the highest similarity scores. The number of nearest neighbors to retrieve can vary depending on the application.
Analyze Nearest Neighbors: Examine the nearest neighbors to understand the relationships between the tokens in the phrase and other tokens in the model's vocabulary. This can provide insights into the context and semantics of the phrase.
For example, let's say we want to find the nearest neighbors for the token "goes" in the given phrase. After generating embeddings for "goes" and calculating similarities, we might find that its nearest neighbors are words like "moves", "proceeds", "advances", etc., which are semantically related to the word "goes".
Please note that the example given here is a simplified version of the process, and actual implementations may involve additional steps and optimizations depending on the specific model and use case.

no. we want to find the nearest neighbors for "BECAUSE OF WHAT IT IS, THERES A WAY THIS ALL GOES" not any of the minor parts.
