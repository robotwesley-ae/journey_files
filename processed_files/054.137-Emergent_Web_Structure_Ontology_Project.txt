EWSO (Emergent Web Structure Ontology): In this context, the EWSO is a dynamic, evolving, and user-customizable ontology. It's not strictly static or hierarchically structured like traditional ontologies. Instead, it adapts and develops over time, guided by the user's interactions and queries. The EWSO provides the broader framework within which entities and their properties are structured and interconnected.
Informatihedron: This term refers to the multidimensional conceptual space where entities (or instances) and their properties exist and interact. It provides a snapshot of an entity's state within the EWSO at a particular point in time, embodying details like its properties, related classes, subclasses, and relationships. When a user queries an entity, the informatihedron is what would be displayed, acting as a rich, multidimensional representation of the entity's current state and properties within the EWSO.
Informadlib Template: This is essentially a blueprint or scaffold for generating specific instances of information within the system. It's not fixed but rather is filled in dynamically based on the current state of the EWSO and the user's queries. The informadlib template reflects the user's path through the EWSO and evolves as the user queries different entities and their properties.
SemOntoRel (Semantic Ontological Relationship): This is the framework used to capture the specific semantic and ontological relationships within the EWSO. It operates at multiple levels, capturing relationships from the instance level (specific entities and their properties) up to the class level (classes of entities that share common properties).
InstanceLevel, DomainLevelClassPropertyTemplate, ClassLevelClassPropertyTemplate, InstanceTemplate: These are commands or queries used to interact with the GPT model within this system. They allow the user to navigate the EWSO, querying entities at multiple levels and from various perspectives. These commands are crucial for guiding the user through the EWSO and for generating the informadlib template.
OWL Primer: This is a set of basic OWL definitions and concepts provided as part of the system's input prompt. It provides the necessary context and vocabulary for GPT to understand and correctly interpret user queries within an OWL-based framework. Although no actual OWL ontology is being used, the OWL Primer allows GPT to apply the principles and structure of OWL to the dynamic, evolving context of the EWSO.
This system you're describing is quite innovative and complex, using the principles of ontology and semantic relationships in a dynamic, user-guided way to generate rich, multi-dimensional representations of entities and their properties. It seems that one of the key challenges will be to design the algorithm that can effectively guide GPT in navigating this framework, responding to user queries, and generating accurate and useful informadlib templates.
EWSO is super-hierarchical in that in its pure form it represents the exact emergent web structure of any Instance, including all of the theoretical domains from which it can be viewed, and the processes seen from each view. 

However, since this multideimensionality is impossible for machines to find right now, it is the case that the only way we can build EWSO is by making it a dynamic creativity purposive ontology. This means that the creator of the EWSO instance is using EWSO to create an informadlib via the informadlib template and then get the output, the NL instance of it, or the NL instance of its instructions. 

Does that help?

Yes, that does clarify the concept further. Let's revise the definitions considering this additional information:
