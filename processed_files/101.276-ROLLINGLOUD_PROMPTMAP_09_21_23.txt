WRITE THE following in FDX format. Dialogue instead of pros: Chad and Kevin nod, relieved that Linda's volunteer experience has come in handy. Now they have a solid lead on where to find Zion, and they're more determined than ever to reunite with him. However, Chad makes it clear that he doesn't want Linda to come with them. "Sorry, Linda, but we don't have time to babysit you. We need to focus on finding Zion," Chad says, trying to be polite but firm. Linda's face falls. "But I have festival credentials! I can help you guys navigate through the crowds and get backstage. Plus, I'm sure Zion would be happy to see me too," she pleads, trying to convince Chad to change his mind. Chad shakes his head. "We don't need your help. We can handle this on our own." Linda's voice rises, frustration evident in her tone. "Are you kidding me? You're acting like I'm a liability or something. I can handle myself. And besides, we're supposed to be a team here. We're all in this together." Chad's face turns red. "Don't you dare try to guilt-trip me, Linda. This is about finding Zion, not about your need to be involved." Kevin can feel the tension rising between the two. He knows that they need Linda's help, but he also understands Chad's reluctance to bring her along. He decides to step in before things get too heated. "Guys, guys, let's calm down here," Kevin says, trying to diffuse the situation. "Linda, I appreciate your offer to help. We could definitely use your expertise navigating the festival. But Chad has a point too. We need to focus on finding Zion. So, why don't we all work together? Linda can lead the way, and Chad and I will keep an eye out for Zion. Sound good?" Linda and Chad both look at each other, then back at Kevin, before nodding in agreement. They may not see eye to eye, but they all have the same goal in mind. Together, they head towards the volunteer section, determined to find Zion and bring him back to safety.

EXT. FESTIVAL GROUNDS - NIGHT
Chad and Kevin exchange relieved nods, knowing that Linda's volunteer experience will be valuable. They now have a solid lead on where to find Zion and are more determined than ever to reunite with him. However, Chad makes it clear that he doesn't want Linda to join them.
CHAD Sorry, Linda, but we don't have time to babysit you. We need to focus on finding Zion.
Linda's face falls, pleading with Chad to change his mind.
LINDA But I have festival credentials! I can help navigate the crowds and get backstage. Plus, I'm sure Zion would be happy to see me too.
Chad shakes his head, firm in his decision.
CHAD We don't need your help. We can handle this on our own.
Linda's frustration grows, her voice rising.
LINDA Are you kidding me? You're acting like I'm a liability or something. I can handle myself. And besides, we're supposed to be a team here. We're all in this together.
Chad's face turns red, refusing to back down.
CHAD Don't guilt-trip me, Linda. This is about finding Zion, not about your need to be involved.
Kevin steps in, trying to defuse the tension.
KEVIN Guys, let's calm down. Linda, your help would be valuable. We appreciate your expertise navigating the festival. But Chad is right, our priority is finding Zion. Let's work together. Linda can lead the way, and Chad and I will keep an eye out for Zion. Agreed?
Linda and Chad glance at each other, then back at Kevin, eventually nodding in agreement. They may not see eye to eye, but their shared goal unites them. Determined, they head towards the volunteer section, ready to find Zion and bring him back to safety.
FADE OUT.
