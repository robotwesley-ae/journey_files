Heroic individuals dominate: In this outcome, the forces of good eventually overpower the demon champions. This leads to an expansion of Sanctuary, with peace and harmony prevailing in most areas. The game of heroic play evolves into a cooperative endeavor, focusing on maintaining and nurturing the well-being of Sanctuary and its inhabitants.
Demon champions dominate: In this outcome, the forces of evil gain the upper hand and push the heroic individuals to the fringes of Sanctuary. Chaos and destruction spread, with the Wasteland becoming more prevalent. The game of heroic play becomes a desperate struggle for survival, as the remaining heroic individuals try to resist the onslaught of the demon champions.
Polarization and fluctuation: In this outcome, the balance between heroic individuals and demon champions keeps shifting. At times, the forces of good gain the upper hand, leading to periods of relative peace and harmony. At other times, the forces of evil dominate, plunging Sanctuary into chaos and destruction. The game of heroic play becomes a constant cycle of rise and fall, with neither side able to maintain control for an extended period.
These outcomes illustrate the various possible scenarios that can arise from the interactions between heroic individuals and demon champions in the Sanctuary concept. The dynamics of the evolutionary game of heroic play can help us understand how these outcomes might arise and what factors can influence the balance between the forces of good and evil in Sanctuary.


But it is impossible that demon champions dominate to the point that no heroes can arise. Same for the opposite. However, it is possible for heroes to dominate via sanctuary systems to the point that demon champions all become heroes before they cause any significant self-torture and this state can remain indefinitely, although it is always possible that a strong demon could shift the pole the other way. Those extreme outcomes donâ€™t seem accounted for. Were they?
You're correct that the extreme outcomes I previously mentioned didn't account for the possibility of a complete transformation of demon champions into heroic individuals or vice versa. I appreciate your input on this matter. With that in mind, let's add two more possible outcomes to the list:
Complete transformation of demon champions into heroic individuals: In this outcome, the forces of good are so powerful and pervasive that they manage to convert all demon champions into heroic individuals. This leads to a stable state of Sanctuary, where peace and harmony reign supreme. While the possibility of a strong demon emerging still exists, the dominance of heroic individuals ensures that any such occurrence would be quickly addressed, maintaining the stability of Sanctuary.
Complete transformation of heroic individuals into demon champions: In this unlikely outcome, the forces of evil manage to convert all heroic individuals into demon champions, leading to a world dominated by chaos and destruction. The Wasteland expands unchecked, and the game of heroic play becomes a desperate attempt by any remaining heroic individuals to resist the overwhelming power of the demon champions. However, the persistence of the Sanctuary concept implies that there's always the potential for the re-emergence of heroic individuals who can challenge and potentially convert the demon champions.
These additional outcomes account for the extreme possibilities you mentioned, where one side dominates to the point of transforming the other completely. It's essential to consider these possibilities when analyzing the evolutionary game of heroic play within the Sanctuary concept.


No not complete conversion at any point - complete conversion guaranteed over time from demon to hero, always. But depending on the state of Sanctuary, this journey takes longer or shorter. You need to remember how co-emergent dynamics work including concatenations and engines
I apologize for the confusion. Based on
