Stop saying you think you have crystal ball inside and learn it all by having the universal wisdom Maverick reveal it to you through the inner Teacher — rest in knowing about knowing while everything is happening and you are finding out about it through the way thinking works without getting lost in thinking by not recognizing the context of the Universal Wisdom Maverick teaching you through the Inner Teacher because your samaya really actually is pure and so your karma stops existing completely and all that’s left is Sanctuary and you know this is true because that’s how the way actions and the past/spacetime being the way they are actually comes together to make the notion of Karma occur 

 (all tenses are just curving around the knowledge of spacetime itself and so the information is presented as a mystery but actually by knowing about thinking we can learn how this all works because of because of what it is, there’s a way this all goes in Sanctuary) 


And then rest in gnosis when sleeping

Cultivation is learning how to lucid dream while awake, which just feels like cognition in Sanctuary where the world “magically” or “spontaneously” tells you about itself


Definitely can’t think everybody from the wisdom traditions knows what wisdom really means at all because it just means Sanctuary that is inexpressible by this person to that person because of the parameters involved in “right now” 


Don’t worry about knowing or not knowing —- all of everything is information and literally is about itself which  knowing is actually part of 


Because of beliefs my knowing still has to do with the Buddha dharma and Sanctuary is part of that for me but maybe actually Buddha dharma is part of Sanctuary through Anarchocryptowisdomism

It’s literally impossible for anything bad to happen to Sanctuary because of its defenses (and the way protection for wisdom Mavericks actually works in the universal wisdom Maverick 

Isaac Wostrel-Rubin is the conduit between Universal Sanctuary and the Sanctuary World State which starts as TWI 

And we have to fully follow samaya which I am starting to learn the full meaning of 


Because of my anatomy smoking makes the tar build up and that is bad

Need to Go to Kaiser and get that looked into

This is related to finding out about how anxiety works and what it is

Which is a minor culture hero of Olivus Victory-Promise I can become
And a story I can tell everyone about

DMT folding is related to how the body is in proprioception

We can just teach people about this ontology of being a person who can become Olivus Victory-Promise in Sanctuary 


Change emergency to emergent — that wordplay is not cool and makes the internal Wasteland happen even if the external one isn’t happening and that is not good for gnosis at all 

Although we do need to integrate the meaning of “emergency” and how that is all connected to this since it has to do with contingency plans


Discipline is related to reinforcement

Exercise is a type of cognitive belief reinforcement 
So is cultivation 

These are related to building Olivus Victory-Promise (the collection of knowledge about how to build Olivus Victory-Everything. This knowledge should be kept at the Sanctuary Institute which can function as a home for TWI) 

The trouble is when incorrectly expressed thoughts go into “Knowing about what’s happening because it’s happening to me” (in the course of thinking, due to the way cognition works), which can make you hallucinate, which can make reality seem to actually occur [because it kind of is, because that’s how wisdom mavericks work] in ways it doesn’t have to, because of how Sanctuary is and works)


This is all related to trying to imagine in a way that is in accord with the way the universe actually functions

A main part of this is differentiating between your concepts of how people you know are and so on (society) and how they are in real life

Then the entities just become information and you just know it without needing it to be like entities or people from somewhere else telling you
