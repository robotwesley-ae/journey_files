They sit in silence for a moment, then Chad pulls out a flask from his pocket and takes a swig. "Hey, you want some?"
Jeremy shakes his head. "No thanks, I'm good."
Chad shrugs and takes another swig. "Suit yourself. More for me."

Rewrite: Jeremy confesses to Chad that his life hasn't turned out how he planned. He tells Chad that he and his wife are struggling, and they're having a trial separation, but they haven't told Zion about it yet. Jeremy also admits that he's not doing as well at work as he wishes he would be.
Chad listens attentively and empathetically. Then, he tells Jeremy his own story. Chad's life took a dark turn after high school. He got into drugs and lost all of his money to his addiction. He couldn't hold down a job and ended up homeless for a while. During that time, he got into a fight with a gang of bikers and ended up getting stabbed. He barely survived and spent months recovering in the hospital.
Jeremy's jaw drops as he listens to Chad's story. He can't believe that his old high school friend went through all of that. Chad continues, telling Jeremy about how he finally turned his life around and got clean. He's been sober for over a year now and has a steady job. But he still struggles with the guilt and shame of his past mistakes.
Jeremy is speechless. He had no idea that Chad had been through so much. He tells Chad that he's an inspiration and that he's amazed at how far he's come. The two friends sit in silence for a moment, lost in their own thoughts.
Finally, Chad breaks the silence. "You know what, man? Life is tough. It doesn't always turn out the way we want it to. But the important thing is that we keep going. We keep trying, no matter what. And we lean on our friends when we need to. That's what they're there for."
Jeremy nods in agreement, feeling grateful for Chad's wisdom and support. He realizes that, despite everything, he still has a lot to be thankful for. And maybe, just maybe, things will start looking up for him too.

again, but make the story get sadder and sadder as he goes

As Jeremy confesses his struggles, Chad listens intently before sharing his own story. He starts by saying that he's never told anyone this before, but he lost his entire family in a freak lawnmower accident. Jeremy looks horrified, but Chad continues, saying that he was the only survivor and has been living with the guilt ever since.
As Jeremy's mouth hangs open, Chad goes on to say that he was so traumatized by the accident that he developed a severe gambling addiction. He lost everything, his job, his house, and his friends. He even had to sell his car to pay off some debts.
But it didn't stop there. Chad then reveals that he was diagnosed with a rare disease that requires him to have a risky and expensive surgery. He has no health insurance and no savings, so he's not sure what he's going to do.
Just when Jeremy thinks things can't get any worse, Chad starts crying and tells him that his girlfriend of five years recently left him for his best friend. Jeremy tries to console him, but Chad just sobs uncontrollably.
Jeremy is at a loss for words as Chad continues to pour out his heart, revealing more and more tragedy and pain. By the end of the conversation, Chad is a broken mess, and Jeremy can't believe the amount of suffering his friend has endured.
But through the tears, Chad manages a small smile and tells Jeremy that he's grateful to have him as a friend. Jeremy nods, not sure what to say, but feeling a deep appreciation for the strength and resilience of his old high school buddy.

rewrite this: The tragic story is interrupted by a phone call from his wife or another clue. This clue should let Jeremy know that Zion actively chose to be seperated
