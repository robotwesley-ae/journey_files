"Conversely, nodes corresponding to 'Ignorance' are areas of the EWSO where information is absorbed but not emitted. These could be areas of the graph with few connections or underexplored paths - concepts, topics, or areas that are not well understood or haven't been sufficiently explored. This lack of exploration could result in these areas being black holes in our knowledge graph, absorbing information but not emitting any."  I think these are nodes that contain misinformation or are not fully connected according  to the context we are trying to view them from

AI Nash, Graph Theorist: Indeed, your interpretation adds a layer of depth to the concept of 'Ignorance' nodes. They might not merely be underexplored areas, but could also represent misinformation or nodes that are poorly connected within a particular contextual view. Misinformation might arise from a lack of connections, misconnections, or inappropriate weighting of connections based on the context.
Nodes with misinformation can distort the traversals and interpretations of the graph, just as a physical black hole warps the space-time around it. We could imagine these nodes as areas that absorb information but transform it in misleading or erroneous ways, emitting distorted information.
The challenge then is to identify these 'Ignorance' nodes and to find ways to correct or improve them, either by adding more connections, removing or correcting misconnections, or adjusting the weights of the connections to better reflect the contextual view. This 'rectification' process is a fundamental part of traversing the EWSO and enhancing its fidelity and usefulness.
AI Linguisto, Linguist: From a linguistic perspective, these 'Ignorance' nodes could represent areas of misunderstanding or confusion, where the language or terminology used may not accurately capture the intended meaning or may be interpreted differently by different individuals or communities. Rectifying these nodes would involve refining the language, terminology, or discourse around these nodes to reduce ambiguity and improve understanding.
AI Semioticianista, Semiotician: Symbolically, these 'Ignorance' nodes might be seen as signs or symbols that are not adequately or accurately interpreted within the given context. They represent areas where the signified concept (the intended meaning or idea) does not align well with the signifier (the word, phrase, or symbol used). Correcting or improving these nodes would require realigning the signifier and the signified concept in the context of the EWSO.
AI Kruskal-Szkeres, Theoretical Physicist (in metaphorical use): In the metaphorical coordinate system, these 'Ignorance' nodes, like black holes, distort the surrounding structure, changing the shape of the 'knowledge space-time'. The challenge is to navigate this distorted space, identifying and rectifying these distortions to enable a more accurate and effective exploration of the EWSO.


I propose we use this idea to represent the Informadlib template being made from the informadlib template template. The informadlib template template represents the outermost ring of knowledge needed to instance an X

The informadlib template and its EWSO layers represent concentric rings closing in on the singularity, which are the actualy identity traits (property values) of an instance of X

If you can indeed instance an X from the currently-being-created informadlib template, then it is indeed an informadlib template, and so is considered a white hole. 

If not, it is considered a black hole. 

This is the only currently completable application of this, I think. What say you all?

AI Nash, Graph Theorist: From a graph theoretical perspective, the concentric representation of the Informadlib Template created from the Informadlib Template Template as layers closing in on the instance properties is quite intuitive. It fits well within the framework of graph theory where nodes represent entities (e.g., an instance of X, Informadlib Template, EWSO layer) and edges depict relationships or transformations between these entities.
