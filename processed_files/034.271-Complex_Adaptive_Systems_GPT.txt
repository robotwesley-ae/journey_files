Step #1: Identify Dream Outcome I had heard of weight loss challenges, so I started there. Lose 20lbs in 6 weeks. Big dream outcome - lose 20lbs. With a decreased time delay - 6 weeks. Note: I wasn't selling my membership anymore. I wasn’t selling the plane flight. I was selling the vacation. When you are thinking about your dream outcome, it has to be them arriving at their destination and what they would like to experience. Step #2: List Problems Next, I wrote down all the things people struggled with and their limiting thoughts around them. When listing out problems, think about what happens immediately before and immediately after someone uses your product/service. What's the “next” thing they need help with? These are all the problems. Think about it in insane detail. If you do, you will create a more valuable and compelling offer as you’ll continually be answering people’s next problem as it manifests.. So, let’s go ahead and list out the problems from a prospect’s perspective as you think about them. What points of friction exist for them? I like to think in the sequence that the customer will experience each of these obstacles. Again, channel insane detail (the more problems the better!). Example Problem List: Weight Loss First thing they must do: Buying healthy food, grocery shopping Buying healthy food is hard, confusing, and I won’t like it Buying healthy food will take too much time Buying healthy food is expensive I will not be able to cook healthy food forever. My family’s needs will get in my way. If I travel I won’t know what to get. Next thing they must do: Cooking healthy food Cooking healthy food is hard and confusing. I won’t like it, and I will suck at it. Cooking healthy food will take too much time Cooking healthy food is expensive. It’s not worth it. I will not be able to buy healthy food forever. My family’s needs will get in my way. If I travel I won’t know how to cook healthy. Next thing they must do: Eating healthy food 1) Etc... Next thing they must do: Exercise Regularly 1) Etc... Now we’re gonna go full circle here. Each of the above problems has four negative elements. And you guessed it, each aligns with the four value drivers as well. Dream Outcome→ This will not be financially worth it Likelihood of Achievement→ It won’t work for me specifically. I won't be able to stick with it. External factors will get in my way. (This is the most unique and service-specific of the problem buckets). Effort & Sacrifice→ This will be too hard, confusing. I won’t like it. I will suck at it. Time→ This will take too much time to do. I am too busy to do this. It will take too long to work. It won’t be convenient for me. Now, go ahead and list out all the problems your prospect has. Don’t let these buckets, which are just meant to get your brain going, constrain you. If it’s easier for you, just list out everything you can possibly think of. What I showed here isn’t just four problems, though. We have 16 core problems with two to four sub problems underneath. So 32 to 64 problems total. Yowza. No wonder most people don't achieve their goals. Do not get overwhelmed. This is the best news ever. The more problems you think of, the more problems you get to solve. So, to recap, just list out each core thing that someone has to do. Then think of all the reasons they wouldn't be able to do it, or keep doing it (using the four value drivers as a guide). Now we get to the fun part: turning problems into solutions. Step #3: Solutions List Now that we have our dream outcome and all the obstacles that will get in someone’s way, it’s time to define our solutions and list them out. Creating the solutions list has two steps. First, we are going to first transform our problems into solutions. Second, we are going to name these solutions. That’s it. So let’s take a look at our list of problems from earlier. What we’re going to do is simply turn them into solutions by thinking, “What would I need to show someone to solve this problem?” Then we are going to reverse each element of the obstacle into solution-oriented language. This is copywriting 101. It’s beyond the scope of this book to get into, but simply adding “how to”
