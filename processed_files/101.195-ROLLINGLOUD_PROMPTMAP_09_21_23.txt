Kevin, taken aback by Melanie's anger, tries to calm the situation.

Melanie, fuming but seeing through Kevin's attempt to appease her, refuses to let him off the hook.
MELANIE (frustrated) You're not going, and I hate when you make me look like the bad guy.
Kevin, feeling exasperated, raises his hands in defeat.
KEVIN (sighs) Okay, fine. I'll return the tickets.
The conversation ends with both feeling unheard and frustrated with the situation, their emotions hanging in the air.
FADE OUT.
