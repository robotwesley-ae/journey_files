INT./EXT. FERRIS WHEEL POD - THE PEAK - CONTINUOUS Kevin eyes the quickly forming mosh pit, stuck 50 feet in the air unable to rush to his son. KEVIN That’s exactly where he posted from. He’s down there. I need to get down now. Kevin, eyes darting around, identifies a pod slightly below their position. Without hesitation... He jumps, landing in the neighboring pod with a thud. CHAD I got your back, buddy. Wherever you go, I go. Before Chad can make the leap, Linda, in a fit of adrenaline, jumps but misses her mark. She dangles precariously between the pods, with only Kevin's grip on her wrist preventing a fatal fall. KEVIN (straining) Hold on, Linda! Suddenly, the Ferris wheel JERKS into motion. Chad, reacting quickly, manages to grab Linda's legs. They're now in a HUMAN CHAIN BETWEEN THE TWO PODS. BRITTANY & TIFFANY Hold on! The Ferris wheel continues its climb before abruptly stopping again. The sudden halt causes Chad to lose his grip on Linda. CHAD Oh shit. With Linda's weight threatening to pull Kevin over as well, he summons all his strength. LINDA (teary-eyed) Kevin, please! Summoning all his strength, Kevin starts pulling Linda up. His muscles strain, his face red with exertion. Chad and the girls in the other pod are yelling, cheering him on. CHAD (yelling) You got this, Kevin! Pull! Pull! Finally, with a last surge of energy, Kevin pulls Linda alllllllllllll the way up and -- WHOOPS! She slips from his grip and falls into darkness. Shock. Did that just happen? They’re all crying... Reveal” the ferris wheel is actually six feet from the ground and everyone is looking at them like they’re nuts. /// rewrite the above scene in the style of Todd Phillips

INT./EXT. FERRIS WHEEL POD - THE PEAK - CONTINUOUS
The Ferris wheel looms over the festival grounds, each pod filled with rambunctious festival-goers. One pod, however, holds a trio of friends who've seen better days. Kevin looks like a man on the verge of a panic attack, desperately scanning the grounds below for his son.
KEVIN
With genuine worry
"My kid's down there! Somewhere in that mosh pit madness!"
He spots a nearby pod, which is only slightly lower.
CHAD
Jokingly
"Hey man, just take a leap of faith. Or stupidity. Whichever hits you first."
Without even chuckling, Kevin leaps to the neighboring pod. He lands awkwardly, drawing some laughs and a few gasps.
CHAD
"See? Leap of stupidity!"
Before Chad can leap himself, Linda, the wildcard of the group, jumps in a brash attempt to keep things moving. She doesn’t quite make it and dangles by one arm.
KEVIN
Holding onto her
"Linda, why can't you just... you know, not be Linda for once?!"
The Ferris wheel lurches back to life, adding more suspense to an already precarious situation. Chad, ever the jokester even in peril, grabs hold of Linda's legs.
CHAD
"Now, this is what I call hanging out!"
As the wheel turns, Linda slips from Kevin's grasp. She lets out a scream, but it's cut short as she lands with a gentle thud, revealing that they're merely a few feet from the ground. Kevin, Chad, and the rest of the pod stare in a mix of relief and confusion.
BRITTANY
"Oh, honey, did you think we were still way up there?"
KEVIN
Embarrassed
"I... Uh..."
CHAD
Chuckling
"Man, I knew we had a few drinks, but that was something else!"
Linda, brushing herself off and with her pride slightly wounded, retorts.
LINDA
"Hey, at least I made the jump! Sorta..."
Everyone in the pod bursts into laughter, the tension from moments ago replaced by the infectious spirit of camaraderie.
CHAD
"Well, here's to leaps of stupidity!"
They all raise an imaginary toast, embracing the absurdity of the moment.
