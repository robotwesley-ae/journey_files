	The GNOSYS Intuitive Intelligence Networking Turntable (GIINT) and the Train of Operatic Thought (ToOT) are parts of SANCREV: OPera, which is an AI agent orchestration and automatic meta-prompt engineering system that combines an agent framework, cognitive architecture, and prompt engineering methodology with an ontological approach to data generation and management. It accomplishes this through combining concepts of chains and factories with LLMs like OpenAI’s GPT-4 and can leverage any other agent framework like OpenAI Assistants and Microsoft AutoGen to create agents to manage under its ontology-aware orchestrator, the Operator. The Operator uses an inner chain of thought workflow of decomposition (cognitive load management), planning (compound effect alignment), chain construction (using the factory pattern to construct new chains from meta-chains), and delivering (executing constructed chains until target generation). These aspects are also reified inside the system prompt of the Operator as templated block sections, such that it contains a self-similar map of the system that is also designed with self-descriptive entities and uses that metaphorical version of the system to operate itself as a chain of latent space manipulations inside a chat. The effect is reification of the allegorical space so that the LLM can extend it through outputting what would otherwise be hallucinations or “roleplay” induced metaphors that here map to realizable instances because of the self-similar allegorization attribute of the system. All workflows operate as chains, on the basis of chaining principles, and the chains have at least these chain types for each inner agent: 1) entity chains which, in aggregate, ontologically define the target; 2) brain chains which define knowledge domains and retrieval information and coordinates for the workflows to make use of as references (to empower the contextual space, ie to sculpt it for the persona appropriately, by providing a proper mapped area of information space for the transformations involved in any workflow, in terms of what is related to it that is either not present in the model or not present in the correct degree for the work to be done); 3) workflow chains which define workflow steps and requirements for a single transformation; 4) flowchains which define workflows required in an entire chat; 5) programmatic chat type chains that describe the workflows to be programmed inside the prompts inside a programmed chat between an assistant and pseudo-user, an example being GIINT’s “GIINT Flow” meta chat type that instantiates programmatic chats with nested participants (AI participants individually “thinking” by using teams/”swarms” of AIs to generate a result and report on the outcome or ongoing operations depending on duration); 6) validated chains containing schemas for replicating results from type 5 chains. This sequence of 6 chains represents the Train of Operatic Thought (ToOT)’s “traintrack”, and the factory aspects that create the nests of the 6 chain types within each other are referred to as “automobiles”. By classifying the chains into these chain types and creating them programmatically with automobile factories during any generative run, ToOT leverages GIINT for the emergence of extremely fine-grained control of ontological lenses for attribute arrays in the final results of a generation run, i.e. to define a traintrack for the properties and to use them as boundaries for generation. Each array of fully validated traintracks contained in a persona creates a “journeyer” agent. Journeyers required for a full generation are referred to as a “traincar”. Anywhere the ToOT goes, it follows the narrative of flowing from base structure to meta structure to super structure via its passengers’ own coming into existence through a grand “operatic”, probabilistically branching ontological chain of thought, where each run is a “train” from an “X OPerator” domain route in the ToOT station called
