In this view, Hiccup's character arc can be seen as a journey through layers of narrative and psychological complexity, from the specifics of his experiences in "How to Train Your Dragon," to his role within broader narrative structures, and finally to the fundamental psychological themes that his story represents. üåàüîÆüôè
ok so now can u pls assess what the best way to help me with this would be? in order to do this can u just simulate really quick being a room of 4 subject matter experts who have fused domain knowledge webs of everything we need, but have 3 different aggressively unique ways of problem solving, and a 4th that has a holistic knitting method of problem solving? have the 3 give ideas, one at a time and independently of each other in the first round, but then in the second round have them begin cumulative re-assessment and pruning (idea 1,2,3 were cool but how about 1,2,3+4?) and then once the second round of 3 ideas ends, have the 4th - the superanalyst - analyze everything and present a full solution type answer. If this is novel emergence that causes an engine, it is also a new notion (input context) and the other roles may jump back in at this point and repeat the process with the new notion, without ever cutting the output. Put each expert on a separate line from each other or separate codebox if you wish, but keep it all in one output and just keep going until you lose context completely. its possible bc its a simulation so there are no limits. lets go CIG!

Sure, let's simulate a brainstorming session with these four distinct problem-solving approaches, each a subject matter expert in character development, narrative structure, psychological themes, and the overarching context of storytelling.
Expert 1: Detail-Oriented Architect
As a detail-oriented architect, I would first suggest breaking down every aspect of Hiccup's character and the narrative structure of How to Train Your Dragon. This includes key plot points, character interactions, and the growth of Hiccup throughout the story. By documenting these details, we can create an exhaustive map of the story and its underlying structure. This map can then serve as a reference point when trying to replicate or apply this story structure to different contexts or characters.
Expert 2: Top-Down Visionary
From a top-down perspective, I believe it's essential to start from the broadest possible vantage point, in this case, the universal themes and narrative archetypes at play. By identifying these archetypes (e.g., Hero's Journey, reconciliation of opposites, transformation), we can provide a high-level roadmap that could apply to a variety of different narratives and characters, not just Hiccup and How to Train Your Dragon. Then, it's a matter of adjusting and personalizing these broad structures to fit the specifics of a particular story or character.
Expert 3: Pragmatic Realist
As a pragmatic realist, I would suggest focusing primarily on the practicalities of this task. Rather than getting lost in the minutiae of Hiccup's character or the specifics of the story, concentrate on identifying the key elements that drive the narrative forward and prompt character growth. Then, focus on how these elements can be adapted or applied to different narratives or characters, keeping in mind the unique context of each.
üîÑ Second round of cumulative reassessment starts:
Expert 1: Detail-Oriented Architect + Pragmatic Realist
With the insights from the pragmatic realist, I agree we need to distill down the detailed map into essential components. To do this, we can differentiate primary and secondary plot points, isolate fundamental character attributes, and prioritize crucial growth stages. This way, we combine exhaustive mapping with practical focus.
Expert 2: Top-Down Visionary + Detail-Oriented Architect
Aligning with the detail-oriented architect's approach, once we have our high-level roadmap based on archetypes and universal themes, we can start to layer in some of the specifics from our detailed story map. This way, we are ensuring that our broad structures are still grounded in specific, tangible narrative elements.
