Jeremy shouts for Chad, but he can't hear anything over the noise. He starts to panic again, thinking he's lost both his son and his high school friend. But then, he hears a voice shouting his name from behind him. It's Chad, who has managed to fight his way out of the moshpit and reunite with them.
As they make their way back to the safety of the VIP section, Jeremy can't help but feel grateful for the unexpected help of his old friend, and for the unforgettable adventure they just had together at Rolling Loud.

Rewrite, but they don't actually find Zion. Perhaps they both get lifted in the air, because they're middle aged and forced to crowd surf? maybe their pants are pulled off?

As Jeremy tries to make his way through the moshpit, he gets hit by a crowd surfer and falls to the ground. He scrambles to get back on his feet, but the pushing and shoving of the crowd makes it difficult for him to move.
Zion is nowhere to be seen, but Jeremy spots a group of guys who seem to be leading the moshpit. He approaches them and tries to explain his situation, but they just laugh at him and push him back into the crowd.
Suddenly, Chad grabs Jeremy by the arm and pulls him up onto his shoulders, shouting "Let's crowd surf, bro!" Jeremy protests, but it's too late. They're lifted into the air by the frenzied crowd.
As they're carried along, Jeremy can't help but feel a bit embarrassed about his situation. His phone buzzes in his pocket, but he can't reach it. Suddenly, he feels a tug on his pants and looks down to see that they're starting to come off.
"Chad, my pants!" he yells, but Chad just laughs and shouts, "Woo hoo! Pants party!" They both start to laugh uncontrollably, forgetting about their search for Zion for a moment.
As they continue to surf the crowd, Jeremy starts to feel a sense of freedom and release. He's never felt so alive and carefree. It's a moment of pure joy, despite the fact that they haven't found Zion yet.
Eventually, they're deposited back onto the ground, pantless and breathless. They stumble out of the moshpit, laughing and joking about their crazy adventure. They still haven't found Zion, but for the first time all night, Jeremy feels like everything is going to be okay.

As Jeremy tries to make his way through the moshpit, he gets hit by a crowd surfer and falls to the ground. Chad is trying to help him up, but the pushing and shoving of the crowd keeps knocking them back down. Out of nowhere, Jeremy's pants get ripped off and he's left in his underwear. Chad can't stop laughing at the sight of his old high school buddy being pantsed in the middle of a moshpit. Just when they think things can't get any worse, they get lifted into the air by the crowd and start to crowd surf. The middle-aged men scream in terror as they're passed around like beach balls. Eventually, they get dumped back onto the ground, pantless and disoriented. Chad is doubled over in laughter, while Jeremy just looks defeated. They still haven't found Zion, and now they're both half-naked in the middle of a sea of people.

great, but anything else funny that could happen here? Maybe Jeremy goes extreme and starts knocking the crap out of the other moshpitters. Maybe Chad and Jeremy are double teaming all the teenage moshpitters and knocking them out way too hard. To the point where they're ostracized for being too voilent?

While Jeremy and Chad are in the mosh pit, Jeremy accidentally elbows a guy in the face. The guy falls to the ground, and Jeremy tries to help him up, but the guy just glares at him and pushes him away. Suddenly, the whole mosh pit turns on Jeremy and Chad, and they become the targets of everyone's aggression.
They start fighting back, knocking people left and right. Chad even gets a few body slams in, and Jeremy's years of playing high school football finally come in handy as he bulldozes his way through the crowd.
But then, a huge security guard appears, grabs them both by
