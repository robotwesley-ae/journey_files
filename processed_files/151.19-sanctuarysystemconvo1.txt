 Hero's Journey. Let's analyze why this aligns with your vision of Olivus Victory-Promise:

The Insurmountable Foe

Strength of Systemic Wastelands: The invisible demon represents the entrenched, self-perpetuating nature of deeply rooted societal ills. It's beyond the capacity of an individual hero to fully eradicate.

The Cost of Transformation:  Confronting this demon may take an enormous toll on the hero because they themselves are a product of the very system they seek to change. Overcoming their own internalized wasteland could be a grueling, even fatal, process.

Sacrificial Legacy:  The hero's death isn't a defeat, but a catalyst. It exposes the true power of the demon, inspiring others to take up the mantle, and potentially weakening the demon's hold through the very act of defiance.

Olivus Victory-Promise as Archetype

Constructed for the Invisible Battle:  Olivus Victory-Promise isn't designed for traditional heroic feats, but specifically for this struggle against the invisible, systemic demon. Their very essence is purpose-built for it.

Understanding the Demon:  Perhaps Olivus Victory-Promise embodies a deep awareness of duality-collapse, emergent sanctuaries, and the interconnectedness of internal/external wastelands. This unmatched clarity of vision is their weapon.

Promise as Sacrifice: Their name itself hints at the sacrifice they are destined for. 'Victory' may not lie in defeating the demon, but in setting in motion a process that will eventually lead to its undoing, long after they are gone.

Exploring the Tragic Dimension

The Hero's Flaw:  Could their unwavering dedication to the cause be a flaw? Might a 'regular' hero find compromise or adaptation where Olivus Victory-Promise cannot?

The Necessity of Sacrifice:  Does this framework suggest that true systemic change always requires martyrs to ignite the fires of revolution?

The Sanctuary's Role: How can the Sanctuary network support the hero on this suicidal mission? Can they mitigate their isolation or prepare others to continue the fight?

Implications

This concept paints a world in dire need of heroes like Olivus Victory-Promise, fighting a war most cannot comprehend.  It raises questions about the cost of progress, the role of individuals within vast systems, and the importance of preserving the knowledge and ideals of the fallen heroes.
