Rewrite the following, but perhaps with a funnier way to break out of this jail: Melinda and Chad exchange a look, feeling a glimmer of hope. But they know they have to get out of jail to make it to the main stage in time. They start brainstorming a plan, but before they can come up with anything, a wild-looking festival-goer stumbles into their cell. The festival-goer introduces herself as "Mushroom Marie" and offers to help them escape. She tells them she knows a secret way out of the jail, but they have to be willing to do something for her in return. She produces a bag of psychedelic mushrooms and asks if they're willing to take a trip with her to the main stage. Melinda and Chad are hesitant at first, but they know they need to get out of jail and find Zion. They agree to take the mushrooms and follow Mushroom Marie as she leads them through a secret tunnel that leads out of the jail. As they stumble out of the tunnel and into the night air, the effects of the mushrooms start to take hold. The world around them becomes a blur of colors and sounds, and they feel a sense of euphoria wash over them. They follow Mushroom Marie through the festival grounds, dodging security guards and dancing their way through crowds of partygoers towards the main stage. As they approach the main stage, Melinda notices that she's sitting on Shenseea's lap. She looks around in a daze, not sure how she got there. The weed mixing with the mushrooms is starting to take effect, and she's feeling disoriented and overwhelmed.

Suddenly, Mushroom Marie stops in front of a locked door. "This is it," she says, gesturing towards the door. "The way out."
Melinda and Chad look at each other skeptically. "How are we supposed to get through that?" Chad asks, eyeing the heavy lock.
Mushroom Marie just grins mischievously and pulls out a kazoo from her pocket. "Watch and learn, my friends."
She starts playing a tune on the kazoo, and to Melinda and Chad's surprise, the lock starts to vibrate and shake. Suddenly, it falls off the door with a loud clatter, and Mushroom Marie opens the door triumphantly.
Melinda and Chad can't believe their luck as they follow Mushroom Marie out of the jail and into the festival. They dance their way towards the main stage, laughing and joking with each other as they go.
