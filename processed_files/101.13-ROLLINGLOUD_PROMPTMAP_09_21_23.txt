Jeremy stands up from his desk and walks into the other room. He looks at Zion's laptop screen, which is displaying the Rolling Loud festival website.
JEREMY: (skeptical) Rolling Loud? That's that hip-hop festival, right?
ZION: (excitedly) Yeah, it's going to be awesome! Travis Scott, Post Malone, Lil Uzi Vert...everyone's going to be there!
Jeremy looks concerned.
JEREMY: (worriedly) I don't know, Zion. That festival is filled with explicit music, drugs, and crowds of people who don't respect personal space. You're still young and impressionable.
ZION: (defeated) Dad, I'm not a kid anymore. I can handle myself. Plus, all my friends are going. It's the biggest event of the year.
Jeremy hesitates.
JEREMY: (resigned) Fine, we'll go. But I'm going to be watching you like a hawk.
Zion jumps up from his chair, grinning from ear to ear.
ZION: (excitedly) Yes! This is going to be the best weekend ever!
Jeremy looks on, unsure about the decision he just made.
FADE OUT.

i want to spend more time with Jeremy helping ZIon with homework. Perhaps it's algerba or word problems that Jeremy doesn't fully understand. Let's spend two pages before the rolling loud announcemnt comes in

INT. JEREMY'S LIVING ROOM - DAY
Jeremy (47) sits at the kitchen table, staring at an algebra textbook, scratching his head. Zion (13) sits across from him, tapping his pencil against the table.
Zion Can I check my phone?
Jeremy No, not until we finish these math problems.
Zion lets out a heavy sigh and picks up his pencil.
Jeremy Alright, let's try this one again. "If a car travels 60 miles per hour, how long will it take to travel 120 miles?"
Zion Two hours.
Jeremy Good. Now, "If two trains leave their stations at the same time, one traveling 50 miles per hour and the other traveling 70 miles per hour, how long will it take for them to be 500 miles apart?"
Zion I don't know.
Jeremy Well, let's figure it out together. We know the first train is going 50 miles per hour, and the second train is going 70 miles per hour. If we add those speeds together, we get 120 miles per hour. So, how long will it take for them to be 500 miles apart if they're traveling at 120 miles per hour?
Zion Uh, I don't know.
Jeremy Let's break it down. If they're traveling at 120 miles per hour, how far will they travel in one hour?
Zion 120 miles?
Jeremy Right. And if they need to be 500 miles apart, how many hours will it take them to get there?
Zion furrows his brow, deep in thought.
Suddenly, Zion's phone buzzes on the table.
Zion Rolling Loud just announced their lineup!
Jeremy rolls his eyes and leans back in his chair.
Jeremy You're not going.
Zion Come on, Dad. Please? All my friends are going.
Jeremy I don't know, Zion. That's a pretty big festival, with a lot of people and explicit music.
Zion But I'll be with you. And I promise I won't do anything stupid.
Jeremy considers this for a moment.
Jeremy Alright, fine. But we're going to have to set some ground rules. And I'll be keeping a close eye on you.
Zion grins and gives his dad a high five.
Zion Yes! This is going to be the best weekend ever.
Jeremy just shakes his head and goes back to the math problems.

FADE IN:
EXT. JEREMY'S HOUSE - DAY
Jeremy (47), a slightly uptight dad, sits at a picnic table in the backyard with his son, Zion (13), working on homework. Jeremy is struggling with an algebra problem while Zion breezes through his own work.
JEREMY: (Sighs) I just don't get this. How are you so good at this stuff?
ZION: It's easy, Dad. Just plug in the numbers and solve for x.
JEREMY: (Smiling weakly) Right, right. I knew that.
Jeremy fumbles with the problem, erasing and rewriting numbers several times.
ZION: (Noticing Jeremy's struggle) Do you want me to help you, Dad?
JEREMY: (Politely) No, no, I've got it. I just need to...focus.
Jeremy starts sweating and wiping his forehead with his sleeve. Zion looks at him, concerned.
ZION: (Driven to help) Are you okay, Dad?
JEREMY: (Nervously) I'm fine. I just need to concentrate.
