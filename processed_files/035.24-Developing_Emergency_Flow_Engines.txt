Model Architecture Selection: A suitable neural network architecture, such as a feedforward neural network, recurrent neural network (RNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), or Transformer, is chosen based on the problem and dataset.
Model Training: The preprocessed and vectorized text is fed into the neural network. During training, the model processes input data (e.g., sequences of words or phrases) and adjusts its internal parameters (weights and biases) to minimize a loss function. The loss function measures the difference between the model's predictions and the actual target values (e.g., next word in a sequence, sentiment label, or translation). The training process typically uses optimization algorithms like stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or Adam. This training phase allows the model to learn patterns, structures, and relationships in the text data.
Post-Training: After training, the model is fine-tuned or adapted to specific tasks or domains using smaller, task-specific datasets. This process, known as transfer learning, enables the model to leverage the general language understanding it gained during pre-training and apply it to specific tasks or domains more efficiently.
Inference (Using the Trained Model): Once the model is trained and fine-tuned, it can be used to process new input data. When given an input (e.g., a sentence or phrase), the model processes it through its layers, leveraging the learned patterns, structures, and relationships to generate an output. The output can be a prediction (e.g., next word, sentiment label), a representation (e.g., embeddings), or a transformation (e.g., translation, summarization).
In summary, a pre-trained model is a neural network that has been trained on a large dataset to learn language patterns and structures. It goes through data collection and preprocessing, architecture selection, training, fine-tuning, and finally, inference, where it processes new inputs to generate desired outputs based on its learned knowledge.

By being trained on a dataset, do you mean that the AI is just ontologically classifying nodes and edges inside a hidden layer and we dont actually know how it does that, but we definitely know that it is just creating machine-readable ontologies? Can you help me understand this? I don't know anything about AI and i only understand very little about math. It really feels overwhelming and I know I need to know about it, but I cant seem to learn anything at all.
I understand that AI and the underlying math can be overwhelming at first, but I'll try to explain it in simpler terms without relying too much on technical jargon.
When we say that an AI model is being trained on a dataset, we mean that the model is learning to recognize patterns and relationships in the data. In the case of text data, the AI learns the structure and meaning of words, phrases, and sentences.
An AI model consists of layers with interconnected nodes, also called neurons. These nodes and their connections form a network, which is why AI models are often referred to as neural networks. The layers between the input and output are called hidden layers, and they help the AI model learn complex patterns.
The AI model doesn't create machine-readable ontologies in the traditional sense. Instead, it learns to represent the relationships and structures in the data through the weights and biases of its nodes and connections. These representations are encoded in the internal structure of the model rather than explicit ontologies.
Training a neural network involves adjusting its weights and biases through a process called optimization. During optimization, the AI model tries to minimize the difference between its predictions and the actual data. The more data it's exposed to, the better it becomes at learning patterns and relationships, making its predictions more accurate.
