Back at home, a week or so later, Melanie and Kevin are in the middle of a tense conversation over dinner when Zion interrupts them, entering the room with his computer in hand. They both turn their attention to their son, who launches into a PowerPoint presentation, passionately and humorously trying to persuade his parents to let him attend Rolling Loud. "Okay, why Zion should go to Rolling Loud. First slide," Zion clears his throat before continuing. "You said it was dangerous, but only 6 people have been killed at a Rolling Loud festival in the six years since it started, while 121 people a year are killed by falling coconuts. You both took me to Hawaii when I was 7 years old, so you put me in more danger back then. Plus, I'll be with you guys the whole time, and I promise I won't get in trouble." Zion's presentation is filled with clever quips and even includes a pretentious quote about the power of art. "Any form of art is a form of power; it has impact, it can affect change â€“ it can not only move us, it makes us move. It is essential for my growth that I go to this." His parents are initially resistant but eventually agree to discuss the matter. Kevin surprises Melanie and delights Zion by revealing that he's already purchased tickets for the two of them. / write the above in FDX as a continuation of the story

INT. KEVIN'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT
Melanie and Kevin sit at opposite ends of the dining table, a seemingly typical family dinner shrouded in an unspoken tension. The sound of the front door opening and closing cuts through the silence.
Zion enters, laptop in hand, brimming with youthful enthusiasm.
ZION (excited) Okay, folks, hold your breath. Why Zion should go to Rolling Loud.
He opens his laptop and begins a PowerPoint presentation, cleverly debunking their concerns about the festival.
ZION (CONT'D) (sincerely) Slide one. Danger factor. Only six people have been killed at Rolling Loud in its six years. Yet, coconuts kill 121 people a year! You both took me to Hawaii when I was seven, so...
Melanie and Kevin share a look of surprise.
ZION (CONT'D) (enthusiastically) I'll be with you guys, and I promise, I won't do anything stupid.
Zion continues with his slides, expertly dropping witticisms and humor.
ZION (CONT'D) (philosophically) Art is power. It moves us, and it makes us move. This festival... it's vital for my growth.
Kevin and Melanie exchange glances, clearly taken aback by their son's unexpected eloquence.
KEVIN (smiling) Alright, we'll discuss it.
Zion grins, triumphant.
KEVIN (CONT'D) (playfully) But I have something to add.
He pulls out two Rolling Loud tickets from his pocket, waving them with a smirk.
KEVIN (CONT'D) Got us a couple of passes. Let's rock and roll, kiddo!
Melanie looks at Kevin, shocked but pleased, as Zion jumps up in excitement.
FADE OUT.
