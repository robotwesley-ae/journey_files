LINDA (excitedly) Hi there! I'm Linda! The drinks are on me! Can I get you fellas something?
Without waiting for an answer, Linda continues talking.
LINDA I don't really know much about festivals, to be honest. I was just bored and thought I'd give volunteering a shot.
Chad snickers and accepts Linda's offer on behalf of both of them, while Kevin hesitates.
CHAD (laughing) Thanks, Linda! I'll have a beer.
Linda turns to Kevin, expectantly.
LINDA What about you, bud?
Kevin takes a deep breath, realizing he can't keep his emotions to himself anymore.
KEVIN (nervously) Actually, Linda, I'm Kevin, and this is my friend Chad. We're in a bit of a bind here. My son, Zion, is missing. He's only thirteen, and I've been searching everywhere for him.
Linda's eyes widen with concern.
LINDA Oh my goodness! That's awful. Have you tried contacting the festival security?
CHAD (interjecting) We did, but they didn't seem to take us seriously. They thought we were just being paranoid.
Kevin nods in agreement.
KEVIN Yeah, they didn't understand the urgency of the situation. They even threatened to call child protective services on me.
Linda's expression turns sympathetic.
LINDA That's terrible! But don't worry, Kevin. I want to help you find Zion. As a volunteer, I have access to some festival resources.
Kevin's eyes light up with hope.
KEVIN You do? That would be incredible!
Chad chimes in, grateful for Linda's willingness to assist.
CHAD (sincerely) Thank you, Linda. We really appreciate your support.
Linda smiles warmly at them.
LINDA Of course! We're all here to help each other. Let's regroup, use these walkie-talkies to coordinate our search, and find Zion together.
They exchange determined glances, ready to face the challenges ahead. Linda, Kevin, and Chad form an unexpected alliance, fueled by their shared mission to locate Zion amidst the chaos of the festival.
They take a deep breath, ready to embark on their search, walkie-talkies in hand, united in their resolve to find Kevin's missing son.

write the following out in FDX: Linda prepares their drinks and hands them towels to clean themselves. She chats excitedly about the festival, mispronouncing band names. LINDA You look like you could use some cheering up. Did you know it's a festival tradition to trade shoelaces with strangers? It's a great way to make new friends! Chad scoffs and interrupts. CHAD (laughing) Yeah, 'cause that's totally not weird at all.

Linda prepares their drinks and hands them towels to clean themselves. She chats excitedly about the festival, mispronouncing band names.
LINDA (cheerfully) You look like you could use some cheering up. Did you know it's a festival tradition to trade shoelaces with strangers? It's a great way to make new friends!
Chad scoffs and interrupts, unable to contain his laughter.
CHAD (laughing) Yeah, 'cause that's totally not weird at all.
Linda shoots Chad a playful glare, undeterred.
LINDA (defensively) Hey, it's all about the festival spirit and connecting with others, man! You never know what kind of interesting people you'll meet. It's all part of the experience!
Chad smirks, teasingly.
CHAD (mockingly) Yeah, yeah, I'll keep that in mind. Maybe I'll even trade my shoelaces for a new life philosophy.
Linda shakes her head, playfully rolling her eyes.
LINDA (mock-serious) Well, if you do, make sure to get the ones with the sparkles. They bring extra good vibes!
Chad chuckles, raising his drink to Linda.
CHAD (toasting) To good vibes and strange festival traditions!
They clink their glasses together, enjoying the light-hearted moment amidst the chaos. Linda's enthusiasm manages to temporarily lift their spirits, providing a brief respite from the stress of finding Zion.
Kevin, however, remains lost in thought, his worry for his son ever-present. He takes a sip of his drink, grateful for the distraction but unable to fully embrace the festival atmosphere.
