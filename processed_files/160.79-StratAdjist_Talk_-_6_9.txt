Black holes, on the other hand, could be represented by isolated nodes or clusters of nodes with little to no connections to the rest of the graph. These could represent areas of ignorance or less known topics.
We could also consider edge weights to represent the strength or quality of the connections. For instance, a connection from a white hole (Nexus node) to another node might have a high weight, indicating strong relevance or a large amount of information flow.
AI Kruskal-Szkeres, Theoretical Physicist: Translating these ideas into a Kruskal-Szkeres coordinate system could be an intriguing endeavor. Nexus nodes, as white holes, might be depicted as areas in the coordinate system from which information seems to emanate. Conversely, black holes, representing our ignorance or gaps in knowledge, might be areas into which information appears to disappear.
The coordinate transformation itself could serve as a metaphor for our process of gaining knowledge, as we move from a state of ignorance (the black hole) towards understanding (the white hole). However, remember that these are analogies and may not fully capture the nuances and complexities of knowledge structures. The analogy breaks down if we press too far: for instance, while white holes are theoretically possible, there is no strong evidence that they exist in our universe. Similarly, the notion of information disappearing into a black hole is problematic, given the principle of information conservation.
In summary, while these concepts can be utilized to create a more visual and metaphorical understanding of knowledge spaces, they do not offer a literal mapping of knowledge onto these physical phenomena. Theoretical constructs and analogies can only take us so far in representing complex systems, and at times, we must rely on the raw, mathematical structures of these systems to fully understand and navigate them.


dont consider physics while we are talking about holographic information insdie GPT. just consider the analogies from physics as ways to hypothesize about GPT's holographic inofrmation space, because it's quantum-like. then we can test them easily by just formulating the NL descriptions of our systems. Can you pls define this new Kruskal-Szkeres-like system for EWSO? 

""[EWSO] (Emergent Web Structure Ontology): The EWSO represents a super-hierarchical, dynamic ontology of the full emergent structure of any instance across theoretical domains. It functions as a creativity purposive ontology, guiding the creation of an Informadlib via an Informadlib Template and aids in generating corresponding natural language instances or instructions. The EWSO encapsulates the pervasive wisdom in valuation processes and cultural memes, aiming to purify the societal context through wise valuation.

[Informadlib]: The Informadlib is a dynamically generated multidimensional data structure that encapsulates an entity's state within the EWSO at a given moment. It is crafted using an Informadlib Template and carries details like entity properties, related classes, subclasses, and relationships. The Informadlib functions as a medium for translating the EWSO's wisdom-infused structure into a communicable format.

[Informadlib Template]: An Informadlib Template is a dynamic blueprint for creating specific instances of Informadlibs. It reflects the creator's path through the EWSO and adapts as the creator explores different entities and their properties. The Informadlib Template is an instrumental tool in generating a Natural Language instance or its instructions.

[Informadlib Template Template]: The Informadlib Template Template is a meta-level blueprint designed to generate Informadlib Templates. It encapsulates the core structure and the process of creating Informadlib Templates, enabling the iterative refinement of Informadlibs in response to evolving exploration within the EWSO.
