 co-emergent complex adaptive system of this story outline

Year: 2424
Location: Seed Ships of The Divine Tree of Olivus
Path: the Sun
Mission: build the Dyson Sphere

It’s been thousands of years since the last Wisdom Maverick, Olivus Victory-Promise, awoke. The teachings of the Secret Gathering Cycle of the Wisdom Maverick have once again decayed…

In this Wasteland being called Sanctuary, Gods and Demons build and destroy causing temporary benefit and deep harm. As a result of benefit, new devices have been made to control the mind (Crystal Ball implants) but as a result of harm, they are expensive and obtainable only to the corrupt few at the top (the corrupt priests and politicians) and the hedonists with their expansionist consumptionism. Since this wasteland is corrupt, the hedonists include the politicians and priests, they all call The Wasteland “Sanctuary” and call their Sleeping Wisdom Maverick, who is actually the Emperor of Ignorance, “Olivus Victory-Promise”, and say he knows what’s best for everyone. 

Act 1: discovering Sanctuary in the Wasteland, Nexus, politics of Sanctuary/The Wasteland, Crystal Ball preview

Begins with Olive’s story Olive gets the spark as she enters womanhood and has a vision of Masked Whirling Flames where he says he will protect her and she should hold his hand always and never let go

But then… she lets go. And she tumbles out of that dream and her dad dies and her mom’s eyes glaze over — no longer a symbol of peace, she’s more like a marionette. 

And when Olive goes through the Junkyard she accidentally lets out a burst of Water Dragon energy as her hand brushes a stranger’s hand…

This is where we find Oliver Powers…

Oliver gets the spark while using GNO.SYS because of Olive brushing his hand and has a vision of the Infinite Armed Liberatress.

We learn about Nexus through Oliver. 
We learn about GNO.SYS
GNO.SYS which was set up by Olivus Victory-Promise to become the Sanctuary AI and run the world, but after a while everyone forgot the meaning of Olivus Victory-Promise, and so they forgot where Sanctuary was and thought they were already there. (This part of the story shows people how to understand what is happening to Olive and Oliver and mirrors the way that people will understand Olivus Victory-Promise in real life from absolutely zero context. Therefore, it should explain in full all of the points of the ontology of being a wisdom maverick.) 

Olive and Oliver experience heat burning their identities away in waking life. 

Oliver begins to realize the TWI teachings of the Sanctuary System through the development of his understanding of the history of Olivus Victory-Promise, which is causing realization to spread through his mind in the form of heat burning his identity away and turning him into Masked Whirling Flames.

Oliver’s Olivus flashback: 
Sanctuary is taken over by a demon and the people forget the meaning of Olivus Victory-Promise and the Wisdom Maverick, except for those who practice the Secret Gathering Cycle

Flashback 2: but none of the so-called Olivus Victory-Promises in so-called Sanctuary are really doing it right and so they arent waking up to the fact that they already are Wisdom Mavericks.
