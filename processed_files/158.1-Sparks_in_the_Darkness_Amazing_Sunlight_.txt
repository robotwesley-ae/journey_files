Seeing this timeless webbed infinitude of infinite perfection
But still not quite “the Awakened One” yet 
Still need to know what the pattern is 
How it occurs 
And once that’s fully revealed 
It seems like you’ll be able to just… leave??? 
Apparently
But I don’t know what comes next 
And I can’t imagine how it’s going to be 
but it’s likely 
all the same 
all the way through!

Foreword

It is important to understand before we begin that because I was not keeping my promises to reality properly, I was confused and ignorant, hurting myself and others for my entire life, and because of that the communities founded by Teachers connected to me that I would’ve been able to practice in either have or would collapse or cease to function properly upon my I finding them. This seemed like a destitute situation until I noticed the sparks in the darkness. 

Once I realized what I had to do to keep my promises, my inner Teacher revealed itself as Amazing Sunlight and I had visions in which the innermost mechanic of the nature of phenomena revealed itself to me in the form of entities that dissolved themselves into me and arose as teachings to help people like me who need to work for a living, are obsessed with fantastic ideas like ever-lasting love, soulmates and higher beings, far away fantastic paradicial worlds without any suffering, and love knowledge and power. For people who endure tremendous suffering both physically and psychically on account of the ignorant mentations of sentient beings, and especially for those who not only endure it but heroically transform themselves for the sake of others because of it! 

For anyone who ever wanted to become a superhero, but always thought the ways superheroes got their powers felt just a little bit too unreal. For all of you, I dreamt this world into reality. I apologize deeply if TWI does not help you. That is not my intent. My intent is to help you discover infinite love and the power to rescue yourself and others from darkness. Know that if you’re not connected to me like that, then this will only be one part of many on your path. Just keep that in mind and know that it is not a big deal. Don’t worry about it! Just let your path reveal itself to you in your own experience of your own thought-feelings. My aspiration is that that happens for you swiftly, effortlessly, and amazingly, to your utter astonishment. May this small book benefit all sentient beings and increase positivity everywhere, always! With a heroic mind of infinite love desiring its soulmate infinite power to rescue beings from the depths of darkness through finding their own innate light, may you reveal the sparks in the darkness for yourself and discover the revelatory full vision of amazing sunlight.

In Reality
There is a promise of love 
Between sentient beings

Between the display 
And the wisdom mind 
If you don’t keep it 
You will always remain in the dimensions of the wanderer
