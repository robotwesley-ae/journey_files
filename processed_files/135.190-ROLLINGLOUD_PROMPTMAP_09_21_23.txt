He clicks to another slide, showing a diagram of the crib connected to a smartphone.
LUCAS (CONT'D) With our new app, you'll always be connected to your baby, receiving real-time updates on their sleep patterns, comfort levels, and overall wellbeing. You'll know the minute they wake up, whether they've rolled over... and if they're not sleeping, the crib can play a gentle lullaby or project a soothing light show.
Kevin watches, a twinge of sadness crossing his face. The idea of being so connected to a growing child hits him hard, reminding him of the connection he's trying to maintain with Zion.
FADE OUT.

Later, Kevin browses the Rolling Loud website, contemplating the ticket prices. "A thousand dollars for VIP? $600 for a picture with Lil Nas X?" he exclaims in disbelief. Kevin's friend and confidant at work, noticing his distraction, points out that Kevin hasn't been genuinely happy in years. Despite the risk to his job security, the friend encourages him to take Zion to the Rolling Loud festival and create lasting memories with his son, reminding him to find his own smile again. As they walk back to the boardroom, Kevin's friend says, "You have to create memories with your son. I wish I could." "Don't you have a young kid?" Kevin asks. "Yeah, but I have a daughter. It's different," the friend replies. Kevin nods, contemplating his friend's words. The friend also reminds Kevin that he needs to let loose and have fun for himself as well. / write the above into FDX

INT. RAYMOUR AND FLANIGAN - KEVIN'S OFFICE - DAY
Kevin browses the Rolling Loud website, eyebrows shooting up in disbelief as he sees the ticket prices.
KEVIN (mock outrage) A grand for VIP? Six hundred for a selfie with Lil Nas X?
JERRY, 40s, a jovial and insightful colleague, strolls in, catching Kevin's exasperation.
JERRY (laughs) Been awhile since you were last at a concert, huh?
Kevin chuckles but can't hide the weariness in his eyes.
JERRY (CONT'D) (sincere) You haven't been really happy in a long time, Kev. Maybe it's time to change that. Take Zion to the festival.
Kevin seems taken aback.
KEVIN That's risky, Jerry.
Jerry shrugs, a sad smile on his face.
JERRY You have to create memories with your son, man. I wish I could.
Kevin looks surprised.
KEVIN (asks) Don't you have a kid?
Jerry grins.
JERRY (nods) Yeah, a daughter. It's different.
They both smile, the silent understanding between them apparent.
JERRY (CONT'D) And remember, it's not just for Zion. You need to let loose and have fun, too, Kev.
FADE OUT.
