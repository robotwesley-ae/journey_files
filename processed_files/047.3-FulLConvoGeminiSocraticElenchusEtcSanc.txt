The collapse of THROWS into primitives DELETES THE REALITY OF "THROWS" and replaces it with WHAT IT REALLY IS AS SUCH. Upon doing so, immediately the effect is the re-instantiation of THROWS as the word that encompasses all of that (which it already was indicated as and understood as, but wasnt formalized as).

Consider (shoe entity gedanken experiment):


You wear converse: [
You take some psychedelics
The checkers on them become an entity, a monster, with teeth
It eats your legs
]


You realize later that: [
your shoes are bad for your feet
Which is bad for your neck
Bad for your posture
Bad for your breathing
Bad for your cognition
Bad for your life
But you conceal that with your identity attachment of being cool or whatever
When you decompose the shoes and what they are and  why you have them from “these converse are part_of being cool” (which can be rendered compressed as “increase X coolness”), you find that it has nothing to do with shoes, and you are talking about yourself and relationships to others and why the need to express relationships via shoes arose in the first place. This is how people think deeply and how they innovate and grow.
The important question here, for our purposes, though, is “Does the monster exist?” Is it real? 
To answer it, you need to know the meaning of a co-emergent sanctuary and wasteland
Your wanting to be something you don’t know how to be, as a core, is torturing you
You are Olivus victory-promise from sanctuary 
And you don’t need to be anyone else
But you are also somebody else
And that person has lots of identities
They are all masks
That can be used for communicating Sanctuary, which purifies Wasteland, or communicating Wasteland, which is toxic and pollutes Sanctuary. 
The Sanctuaries and Wastelands of our own mind, which we aggregate there, create real world effects and are all interconnected. My interconnectedness with the "being cool" sanctuary devolved into a wasteland. In the "being cool" wasteland, i realized the existence of sanctuaries and wastelands, and how they change from being one to another, but there is a continual fractal growing towards Sanctuary and away from Wastelands. All wastelands perpetuated by me can pollute others. All Sanctuaries perpetuated by me can purify others. It also means I can give this monster to other people, or I can fight it before they encounter it, and through doing so, at the very least, I will become an example for anyone who encounters it.

It is equally scientific to say they died from cigarette monster attack. The only barrier is whether or not we actually formally call cigarette induced lung cancer "the cigarette monster". 

It is **not relevant**. The cigarette monster **exists** by way of being a mapped allegory, and not just a metaphor.

Only then can you reformulate “coolness” (being of cool) and arrive at being your authentic self, purified of pollution from the wasteland, even if only the very small shoe monster wasteland. 
 

So confronting and dismantling the monster is the way to purifying the wasteland and going to sanctuary. This is not new lmao Trito
 

Sanctuary system will map to every myth in existence. It is a super-meta hero’s journey that instantiates the experience of recognizing what it means to be the mentor thru becoming the hero for the first time
 

It is a misconception to think the HJ ends when the hero returns bc actually the full structure is that they return after slaying the dragon but societal problems have internal reflections too that prevent the external victory from mattering. There is a larger problem that was invisible before, which only the hero can solve, on account of already having become the hero.

The hero then usually dies fighting that invisible demon. This is because it is much much stronger than any hero. Olivus Victory-Promise is manufactured, designed, to battle that.
 

Exactly. This is the bootstrapping process called Building Olivus Victory-Promise within
