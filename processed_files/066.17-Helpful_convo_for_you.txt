Conceptual Framework for Information Pricing Based on Complexity:
PhD Level: The highest level of complexity, involving intricate theories, advanced methodologies, and specialized knowledge.
Cost: Equivalent to the tuition and fees associated with a PhD program.
Scope of Intricacy: Deep dives into specialized domains, requiring a high level of expertise and understanding of complex structures.
Masters Level: Advanced but less specialized than PhD level, often involving a broader range of topics within a specific field.
Cost: Equivalent to community college costs.
Scope of Intricacy: Focuses on advanced topics but with less specialization, suitable for professionals and those with some background in the field.
Bachelors Level: General knowledge across a variety of subjects, suitable for a wide audience.
Cost: Equivalent to the cost of an expensive extracurricular activity.
Scope of Intricacy: Covers foundational and intermediate topics, designed for general understanding.
Application to the System as a Teachable Prompt-Writing Skill:
Prompt for PhD Level Complexity:
"Provide an exhaustive ontological enumeration of [X], incorporating principles of Quantum Mechanics, Tensor Calculics, and Advanced AI Modeling. Detail the interdependencies and emergent properties."
Prompt for Masters Level Complexity:
"Explain the key principles and methodologies behind [X], and how they are applied in real-world scenarios. Include relevant case studies."
Prompt for Bachelors Level Complexity:
"Give an overview of [X], explaining its importance and basic functionalities. Use analogies and examples for better understanding."
How to Use These Prompts:
PhD Level: Suitable for researchers, academics, or professionals who require a deep understanding of a subject. The cost associated with this level of information would be high, reflecting the depth and specialization of the content.
Masters Level: Ideal for professionals or students with some background in the subject. The cost would be moderate, making it accessible to a larger audience while still providing advanced knowledge.
Bachelors Level: Perfect for general audiences who want a foundational understanding of a topic. The cost would be relatively low, making it widely accessible.
[Finalization]:
The conceptual framework for information pricing based on complexity has been constructed. This framework can be used as a guide for crafting prompts that cater to various levels of educational complexity, each with its own associated cost. This allows for a scalable and flexible approach to information dissemination, making it a valuable tool for educators, researchers, and content creators. ðŸŽ¯

â–¶ [SKILL] â†’ [SKILL] â†’ {...} â†’ [SKILL] => ${OUTPUT}âœ”
Communication Framework Based on InfoScent=Value Formula:
InfoScent=Value: The value of the information is determined by its ability to satisfy the user's needs, which are quantified by various metrics and thresholds.
Find=+Abundance: The information should be abundant and easily accessible.
Metric=MaxPotential: The value is maximized when it helps the user reach their maximum potential.
ActSpectrum=CompetitiveAdvantagePerception: The information should provide a perceived competitive advantage.
