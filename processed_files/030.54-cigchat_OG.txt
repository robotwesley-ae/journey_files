ONT: Yes, furthermore, "Ontological Classification" should be defined as the process of categorizing elements based on their existential nature and properties.
Linguist: I suggest we define "Informadlib Template" as the generalized structure that can be filled with specific instances to generate unique informadlib instances.
Semiotician: I would also propose we define "Semantic Meaning" as the inherent sense or significance of an element, derived from its use or representation in the informadlib.
Round 3:
EDS: Given the inputs, I propose "Emergent Instance-Level Property" as the unique, observable attribute or characteristic of an informadlib instance, revealed through its SemOntoRel connections and interactions within the emergent web structure.
ONT: To that, let's add "Domain Ontology" as the specific area of knowledge or understanding related to the informadlib context.
Linguist: We also need to define "Causality Chain" as the sequence of cause-and-effect relations linking elements within the emergent web structure.
Semiotician: Finally, we should include "Feedback Loop" as the system where the output of a function is used as its input, which in this case would be the continuous refinement and evolution of the emergent web structure through repeated application of the SemOntoRel framework.
Expert 4 (Ontologist): Reviewing all of this, it seems we are creating a cohesive, comprehensive glossary. All terms seem properly defined and related to each other, which will help the AI to better understand the complex mechanisms at play when using the SemOntoRel framework. Each term is ontologically sound and provides a semantic network for better comprehension.
Continue with more and pls present the current list of terms at the beginning each time before letting the experts output, for continued context

Current Glossary of SemOntoRel terms:
SemOntoRel: Application of semantic ontology to the relational structure of an informadlib.
Emergent Web Structure: A dynamically generated representation of the informadlib, made up of interconnected nodes representing instances of information.
Informadlib Instance: A specific realization of a general informadlib template.
SemOntoRel Connection: The relationship between two elements of an informadlib instance, informed by both their semantic meanings and their ontological classifications.
Knowledge Space: The multidimensional semantic space in which informadlib instances and their SemOntoRel connections are embedded.
Ontological Classification: The process of categorizing elements based on their existential nature and properties.
Informadlib Template: The generalized structure that can be filled with specific instances to generate unique informadlib instances.
Semantic Meaning: The inherent sense or significance of an element, derived from its use or representation in the informadlib.
Emergent Instance-Level Property: The unique, observable attribute or characteristic of an informadlib instance, revealed through its SemOntoRel connections and interactions within the emergent web structure.
Domain Ontology: The specific area of knowledge or understanding related to the informadlib context.
Causality Chain: The sequence of cause-and-effect relations linking elements within the emergent web structure.
Feedback Loop: The system where the output of a function is used as its input.
Let's expand this further:
Round 1:
EDS: We should define "Dimensional Link" as the SemOntoRel connection between two nodes that exist in different dimensions within the Knowledge Space.
ONT: Agreed. In addition, "Existential Property" could be defined as a characteristic of an informadlib element that defines its existence within the Emergent Web Structure.
Linguist: Adding to that, "Representational Element" is an element within the informadlib that carries a certain Semantic Meaning and can be classified using Ontological Classification.
Semiotician: We can also define "Interconnected Node" as a point within the Emergent Web Structure that is connected to other nodes through SemOntoRel connections, representing the multidimensional relationships of an Informadlib Instance.
Round 2:
