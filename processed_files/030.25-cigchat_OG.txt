After considering Expert 2's and Expert 3's suggestions, I still hold my previous position. However, I'd like to integrate the ontology-based mapping into the semantic parsing process. The output of the parser can then be aligned with our predefined ontology structure. The AI model, as Expert 3 suggested, can then validate and refine this mapped output, resulting in a more accurate informadlib.
Expert 2 (Ontologist):
Given the points of my colleagues, I propose a modification to my original idea. We can use a semantic parser as the initial processing step. The parser can detect and classify the key elements of the sentence. The results of the parser can then be used to map onto our ontology. After this, the AI model can take this mapped output and refine it based on learned patterns of narrative structure.
Expert 3 (AI Architect):
Reflecting on the input from Experts 1 and 2, I propose a unified model where the AI learns from an ontology-guided semantic parser. We would train the AI model using data generated by the parser, which was guided by our ontology. This will help the AI to understand and learn the narrative structures and their mapped ontology.
Final Analysis - Expert 4 (Superanalyst):
Given the input from the three experts, a hybrid solution seems to be the most promising approach. Here is the proposed process:
Use a semantic parser to extract the key elements from the sentence. The parser should be capable of detecting and classifying entities, relationships, and events.
Map the parser's output onto our predefined ontology. This will provide a structured representation of the sentence.
Employ an AI model trained on data generated by the parser, guided by our ontology. The AI model should understand the narrative structure and refine the mapped output, providing a precise informadlib.
This approach combines the strengths of all three suggestions and seems to provide the most comprehensive solution.
"We need to build an ontology that represents the possible structures and semantics of the types of sentences we want to analyze."  This is true but we need to clarify why. I dont think you all are talking about the same thing I am. 

1) we cannot make AI models
2) we cannot get outside data
3) we cannot inject outside data
4) we can only work with GPT
5) we can have a roleplay on GPT that is locked in an info-space identity of informadlibs
6) we can build informadlibs in there, iteratively
7) that is what this chat is and even though it is not possible for GPT to contextualize that fully, its true
8) as such, we should continue iterating as follows:

the ontology that we need to build, in my opinion, is the ontology of *ontologically defined sentence level entity properties->general theoretical classes* 

Now, recall what CIG did:

"Through [learning_method/verb] [subject_matter] from [source/mentor], [main_character] successfully [applies_knowledge/verb] during [specific_situation], earning [positive_reaction] from [group] but [negative_reaction] from [individual]."
[learning_method/verb]: This denotes the protagonist's method of acquiring new wisdom or skills in the context of the narrative. It could be an instance of a broader symbol like 'transformation' or 'growth'.

[subject_matter]: This is the specific wisdom or skills being learned by the protagonist. It might symbolize a key theme or lesson in the story, such as 'understanding others' or 'overcoming fears'.

[source/mentor]: This entity serves as a symbol of wisdom or guidance. The relationship between the main character and their mentor often represents themes of discipleship, learning, and growth.

[main_character]: The protagonist of the story. Their journey often symbolizes a universal human experience or challenge.

[applies_knowledge/verb]: The action of applying learned knowledge often represents a turning point in the narrative or a sign of the protagonist's development.
