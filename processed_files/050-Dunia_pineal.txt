Dunia pineal gland opening 
From corpse to village 
Burning 

Dunia wakes up 

Wondering what soma experience is, she wants to go on the journey 
She ends up finding a mentor
And crosses the threshold - soma initiation
Now with a group, she engages in fun and games 
Learns about stronger outer soma, but it’s too secret for her, and also people talk about inner soma but nobody has been able to do it 
She learns about the aspects of the realization to come 
And they say they’ll show her but then
The ordeal comes - the big external fear shows up
The midpoint comes with a battle
there is a lull and personal development - getting closer to fulfilling inner desires 
But bad guys close in - reminder of the inner fear
And they destroy the idea of the outer soma completely 
Desperately hopes the inner soma really is inside her, she relies on her own personal history-feeling-insight and sits down to do it once and for all 
Then it happens
Sparks - the experience she needed comes 
She sees the sword and grabs it, conquering her inner fears 
And then confronts the outer manifestation 
And brings the gift of the elixir to the world
