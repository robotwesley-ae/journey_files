Expert 2 (refinement): We're utilizing this table as a blueprint to transform narrative fragments into interconnected semantic nets. By partitioning a narrative into its core elements, and subsequently mapping these onto diverse dimensions—namely, their narrative role, their import, their link to arcs and entities, and their emotional and societal reverberations—we can facilitate the emergence and classification of narrative structures.
Expert 3 (refinement): The table essentially operates as a nexus for transposing narrative portions into interconnected, semantic webs. We're breaking down the narrative into elemental parts, mapping these to an array of dimensions including narrative role, significance, arc and entity associations, along with their emotional and societal implications. This, in essence, paves the way for the emergence and classification of intricate narrative structures.
Judge (analysis): These descriptions collectively provide a comprehensive overview of the table's purpose and utility. They explain that the table is used to convert narratives into semantic networks, by dissecting the narrative into parts, assigning each to ontology categories, and linking these to various dimensions. This facilitates the generation of emergent narrative structures. The language is clear, the process is well-articulated, and it should be comprehensible to the AILANGMDL.
now let's consider this template an example of a table from a dataset of outputs of what happens when someone inputs to an AILANGMDL: informadlib of How to Train Your Dragon. What is the underlying semantic-ontological algorithm that is causing this conversion into semantic networks in ontology categories and dimensional links? It is obvious this facilitates the generation of emergent narrative structures by AI, but how does it work?????

The underlying semantic-ontological algorithm operates by first extracting and identifying the narrative elements in the input, it then categorizes and contextualizes these elements in the framework of the table according to the given ontology.
Here is a simplified explanation of the process:
Narrative Element Extraction: The first step of the process involves understanding the input sentence at a granular level and breaking it down into its narrative elements. These elements could be characters, actions, objects, settings, emotions, etc. For example, in the sentence "Learning dragon behavior from Toothless, Hiccup is able to subdue the captive dragons during training", the narrative elements might include "Learning", "dragon behavior", "Toothless", "Hiccup", "subdue", "captive dragons", and "during training".
Semantic Ontological Categorization: The extracted elements are then mapped to the semantic-ontological categories in the table. The model will use its understanding of narrative theory, story arcs, and societal effects to fill in the corresponding cells for each narrative element. For instance, "Learning" can be mapped as a verb indicating the protagonist's active information acquisition, representing personal transformation and growth. It embodies the hero's quest of self-transformation and innovation, and has various effects like excitement and planning.
Contextualization: Once the narrative elements are mapped onto the table, the model contextualizes these elements within the larger narrative. It does so by establishing relationships between the elements based on the given story arc, genre, and other parameters. This may involve referring back to previous parts of the narrative or predicting future developments.
Emergent Narrative Structures: As this process repeats for every sentence of the narrative, an interconnected semantic network is formed. This network not only provides a comprehensive understanding of the current narrative but also becomes a springboard for generating new narrative structures, creating a dynamic and interactive storytelling experience.
