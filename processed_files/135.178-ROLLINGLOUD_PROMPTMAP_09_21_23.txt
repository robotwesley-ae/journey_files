 TO REALITY:
The group watches, faces pale with shock.
CHAD:
"She's... she's falling!"
BRITTANY & TIFFANY:
"...Oh my God."
KEVIN:
(teary-eyed)
"I... I can't watch."
The Ferris wheel continues its descent, every creak a grim reminder.

EXT. FESTIVAL GROUNDS - NIGHT
As the pod lands, they expect the worst. But they’re greeted by festival laughter and music. Linda, slightly disheveled but otherwise fine, greets them cheerily.
LINDA:
"Hey there! You all look like you've seen a ghost."
KEVIN:
(stammering)
"But... we saw..."
LINDA:
"A terrifying fall? Oh, you bet."
FLASHBACK:
As Linda descends:
SLIDE! Linda's foot catches on the railing of another pod. It jolts her, and she clings momentarily before losing grip again.
SWIPE! She grazes the side of a pod's exterior. The friction slows her descent slightly, causing her to spin a bit.
CRUNCH! Her fall is broken by a canopy of a food vendor's stall below, tearing through it before she finally lands on the soft, bouncy safety net.
Bystanders rush over, helping her to her feet.
VENDOR:
"Hey, that was my canopy!"
LINDA:
(embarrassed)
"Sorry... can I buy a funnel cake to make up for it?"
BACK TO THE PRESENT:
LINDA:
"I might owe some money for damages. Also, funnel cakes are delicious."
CHAD:
(chuckling)
"We thought you were gone, and you're here bargaining with vendors?!"
LINDA:
"It was a long fall. Got hungry."
They all laugh, relieved and embracing the roller coaster of emotions they just experienced.

The revised flashback uses elements of the Ferris wheel and the festival grounds to give a more genuine feel to Linda's tumble.
i like the first two bumps, but the food vendor canopy seems to defy physics. I'd love the fall to be really grounded in reality. It could be comedic, but the audience needs to believe that this could happen in the real world

Absolutely understood! Let's keep the fall rooted in realism.

INT./EXT. FERRIS WHEEL POD - THE PEAK - NIGHT
The Ferris wheel groans to a sudden stop. Kevin, Chad, Linda, Brittany, and Tiffany are trapped at its zenith.
KEVIN:
"That’s exactly where he posted from. He’s down there. I need to get down now."
Kevin makes a bold leap to a neighboring pod. Chad and the girls brace themselves.
LINDA:
"I can do that too."
She takes a leap, but her momentum is off.
LINDA'S PERCEPTION:
Time slows. Linda senses herself descending. Festival lights blur beneath her, and the ground appears distant and foreboding. She reaches futilely towards the pod.
BACK TO REALITY:
The group watches, faces pale with shock.
CHAD:
"She's... she's falling!"
BRITTANY & TIFFANY:
"...Oh my God."
KEVIN:
(teary-eyed)
"I... I can't watch."
The Ferris wheel continues its descent, every creak a grim reminder.

LINDA:
"A terrifying fall? Oh, you bet."
FLASHBACK:
As Linda descends:
SLIDE! Linda's foot catches on the edge of a downward-facing light fixture. It briefly slows her descent, causing a brief flailing motion.
SWIPE! A decorative banner, strung between the Ferris wheel's pods for the festival, gets caught around her, pulling her to the side for a split second before tearing away.
BOUNCE! A large, springy cable supporting the Ferris wheel structure acts like a trampoline sling. When she lands on it, it bounces her a few feet to the side onto a soft safety net installed for maintenance purposes.
A few festival maintenance workers rush over, startled by the unexpected "drop-in."
WORKER:
"Ma'am, that's not a bungee jump!"
LINDA:
(embarrassed)
"Guess I found out the hard way."
BACK TO THE PRESENT:
LINDA:
"Who knew safety measures would actually come in handy? Oh, right, probably the safety inspectors."
CHAD:
(chuckling)
"We thought you were gone, and here you are, cracking jokes?"
LINDA:
"Life's short. Or, at least, falls can be."
They all laugh, the tension of the previous moments melting away.
