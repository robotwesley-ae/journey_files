"Hello, ChatGPT. We're delving into a sentence from 'How to Train Your Dragon' to unravel its narrative elements. The sentence is: 'Learning dragon behavior from Toothless, Hiccup is able to subdue the captive dragons during training, earning admiration from his peers but suspicion from Astrid.' Our mission is to formulate an informadlib - a table-based instancing template - that pinpoints sem-onto relationships, traces the stages of the Hero's Journey, dissects both external and internal arcs, and scrutinizes the psychological and societal effects. Further, we must categorize story entity classes and illuminate the archetypes they signify. Could you help guide us in this endeavor?"
ok but we need to use SemOntoRel to now get the informadlib of that that is ontologically generalized to instance a "informadlib generator simulation roleplay"
ChatGPT
Absolutely! It's essential to keep the conversation grounded within the SemOntoRel framework. Here's how the prompt could be adjusted to fit that paradigm:
"ChatGPT, we're engaging in a SemOntoRel-based roleplay where our task is to generate a semantically ontologized instancing template, known as an 'informadlib', from a story sentence. Here is the sentence from 'How to Train Your Dragon': 'Learning dragon behavior from Toothless, Hiccup is able to subdue the captive dragons during training, earning admiration from his peers but suspicion from Astrid.' The informadlib should contain
No ChatGPT doesnâ€™t know what any of that means. Bring the expert panel back so they can iterate the best prompt to explain this multidimensional emergent web structure and informadlib
ChatGPT
Of course! The panel of experts can be brought back to craft a ChatGPT prompt which would ensure optimal understanding and response from the AI. Their combined insights and expertise should result in a highly effective and efficient prompt. Let's get started.
Expert 1: "ChatGPT, I'd like to engage you in an exercise of semantic-ontological relationships (SemOntoRel). Let's consider a sentence from 'How to Train Your Dragon' and dissect its narrative structure. The sentence is: 'Learning dragon behavior from Toothless, Hiccup is able to subdue the captive dragons during training, earning admiration from his peers but suspicion from Astrid.' Your task is to create a table where you analyze the components of the sentence according to SemOntoRel. The table columns should include: 'Word/phrase', 'SemOntoRel', 'HeroGoal-ExternalArc-InternalArc-Indicates', 'StoryEntityClass-Embodies-EmbodimentArchetype', 'SubSubGenre-SubGenre-Genre-Psychological Meaning-Type of Catharsis', 'Dream Effect-Planning Effect-Behavioral Effect-Societal Effect.'"
Expert 2: "ChatGPT, we are embarking on an experiment in semantic and ontological relationships within narrative texts. The target sentence is: 'Learning dragon behavior from Toothless, Hiccup is able to subdue the captive dragons during training, earning admiration from his peers but suspicion from Astrid.' I would like you to construct a table that outlines the semantic and ontological relationships within this sentence. The categories to consider are: 'SemOntoRel', 'HeroGoal-ExternalArc-InternalArc-Indicates', 'StoryEntityClass-Embodies-EmbodimentArchetype', 'SubSubGenre-SubGenre-Genre-Psychological Meaning-Type of Catharsis', and 'Dream Effect-Planning Effect-Behavioral Effect-Societal Effect'."
Expert 3: "ChatGPT, let's break down a sentence from 'How to Train Your Dragon' according to semantic-ontological relationships or SemOntoRel. The sentence we're going to use is: 'Learning dragon behavior from Toothless, Hiccup is able to subdue the captive dragons during training, earning admiration from his peers but suspicion from Astrid.' For this exercise, please construct a table that outlines the key components of this sentence according to categories such as: 'SemOntoRel', 'HeroGoal-ExternalArc-InternalArc-Indicates', 'StoryEntityClass-Embodies-EmbodimentArchetype', 'SubSubGenre-SubGenre-Genre-Psychological Meaning-Type of Catharsis', and 'Dream Effect-Planning Effect-Behavioral Effect-Societal Effect'."
