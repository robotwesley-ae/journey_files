In this ontology, we have:
Entity: A superclass that can represent anything.
Instance: Represents instances that have properties (hasProperty) and associated emergent structures (hasEmergentStructure).
EmergentStructure: Represents the emergent structures associated with instances, which also have properties.
Property: Represents the properties that instances and emergent structures can have.
hasProperty: A transitive property that associates instances and emergent structures with properties.
hasEmergentStructure: A transitive property that associates instances with emergent structures.
This is still a simplification and it may not capture the dynamism and complexity of your model. To make it more dynamic, other methods or technologies might be needed. For example, additional programming logic could be used alongside the ontology to update its structure according to specific rules or conditions.


no u moron. of course the ontology itself is static. the user's own version of EWSO for instance X which is a conversation context in chatGPT is dynamic and that's tracked by the informadlib and then when u have the informadlib it's a static EWSO informadlib template t o be used infinitely

I apologize for the misunderstanding. I see where you're coming from now. In essence, each user interaction with the model could dynamically shape a unique "path" or structure through the broader, static ontology. This is reflected in the accumulated 'informadlib' for each conversation.
In terms of a query to the model that could extract such a path or structure, it would involve leveraging the pre-defined relationships (such as SemOntoRel) in the context of a specified instance. For example, you might use a natural language request such as:
"Given the instance X, show me the emergent web structure of class-level-property-wave-spectrum-boundaries as they relate to the instance-level properties of X."
The answer the AI provides would likely depend on its understanding and modelling of the relationships between concepts, and might look something like a nested hierarchy or tree of related concepts and properties, as dictated by the user-defined SemOntoRel. The model's response could then be parsed and assembled into the informadlib for that conversation.
While this process might not fully capture all the nuance of the dynamic emergent web structure you've described, it's a step in that direction. With further refinement and potentially integrating other tools or techniques, it might be possible to better model this dynamic emergent structure concept.


yes now write it in OWL-DL instead of NL.

I understand your request, and I'm here to help, but I need to clarify one aspect. As an AI model based on a transformer architecture, I don't have access to a dynamic database or a way to manipulate external ontologies. What I can provide is a pseudo-example of how you could model this ontology in OWL-DL syntax based on the concepts and relationships you've described.
Let's consider a simplified example of your Emergent Web Structure Ontology (EWSO) with the classes Story, Scene, and HeroGoalsExternal.
