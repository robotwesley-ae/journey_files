Myth of idealized patriotic world order

Where each superhero represents an aspect of the current status quo society’s government or ruling structure: American industry (Tony stark), American might (Captain America), American Intelligence Services (Black Widow), American Skill (hawkeye), American Scientific Achievement and Advanced Weaponry (Bruce Banner, the hulk) 

Obstacles are solved by how awesome they are because they are superheroes

Star Wars mimic score

MacGuffin at the start which is the reason the bad guys are here

Group them together in twos and go thru the HGS group by group 

Group altogether between ordeals for downtime until the finale when they come together on their own 

Avengers entity (group) is the main character
The influence character is “the missing component in the form of the next group member” 
Relationship throughline always takes place with all avengers present 

Their command center soars through the air representing the extreme optimism towards the future 

Comedy, drama developments as bridging out
B story is the development of interpersonal relationship between the avengers (not only the pairs but still mainly them)
False defeat midpoint
All is lost
Notion of The Avengers Initiative is dead
Need to get team back together
Influence character decides to power up and join team in spirit but not officially
Everyone powers up because they’re avengers 
Dialogue with the bad guy
Surprise attack first wave of bad guys
Avengers assemble 
And fight to save the world 
Bad guy hurts the influence character
Avengers use their individuality to overcome various obstacles to get to the bad guy while protecting people
And start to work together
Stunning surprise 2 happens and is a big mob that precipitates bigger, second wave of bad guys
The plan is put together
Everyone does their super power to the minions and each defeat an entire wave’s worth by themselves 
While interweaving helping each other out
Sequences change by endangering larger and larger numbers of people
Stakes are raised, ticking clock
Bad guy appears
Everyone works together to confront the big bad
Finally, once everyone gets there, as a team, they confront the big bad and solve their arcs through their actions
The idea of the MacGuffin that solves the problem of the minions is stated
Finale threat arrives from the ticking clock
Final hero in the group solves their arc
Which solves the overall story
And brings the avengers closer together
But seems like they sacrificed themself (death)
But the team saves them (resurrection)
Comedic resurrection beat
Win the day
Arrest the cosmic bad guy 
9/11 metaphor as attack is remembered and people thank the avengers 
Reveal the MacGuffin is safe in our hands
Bad guy brought to Justice 
Promise of the Future
Theme: technology will destroy the world if it falls into the wrong hands and will do so if there isn’t a heroic world order
