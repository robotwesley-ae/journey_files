⁠vault⁠  In the following representation, I will refer to the entity as AQICVQPFIC (the acronym for AestheticQualityInContentValueQualityPerceptionForcesInstantiationChain) to simplify. [Domain Ontology (1.1, 1.2)] 1.1 - The domain ontology of AQICVQPFIC would involve the study of the aesthetic quality in content and how it bears value, i.e., how aesthetic quality is perceived and appraised in different contents. 1.2 - Another facet of the domain ontology would involve perception forces, i.e., how different factors affect the perception of aesthetic quality and thus influence the perceived value of content. [Process Ontology (1.3)] 1.3 - The process ontology of AQICVQPFIC would study the process of instantiation of aesthetic quality in content upon perception. It includes how aesthetic content makes its mark and becomes relevant and valued based on instantiating processes. [Integrated Ontology (1.4)] 1.4 - The integrated ontology of AQICVQPFIC would combine the ontologies from the two domains (1.1, 1.2) and the process (1.3). This space includes every possible interaction, overlap, and outcome stemming from the dialogue between the nature of aesthetic quality in content, perception forces, and instantiation processes. In terms of individual instances, here are three examples: 1.4.1 - The instance when a piece of art (content) with high aesthetic quality is undervalued due to warped perception forces and fails to instantiate as high-value content.
 1.4.2 - The instance when low aesthetic quality content is inflated in value due to influential perception forces, leading to successful instantiation as high-value content. 1.4.3 - The proper instantiation of content with high aesthetic quality valued rightly due to unbiased perception forces.

These instances are just a tiny fraction of the countless permutations possible in the cross-section between the two domains and the process. The integrated ontology covers all these possibilities and much beyond. [Conclusion]
 Simply put, AQICVQPFIC humbles us with the complexity and depth of understanding that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to valuing content aesthetic quality. It exposes the mechanisms of perception forces and how they play a pivotal role in the instantiation process, eventually influencing the valued position of content in our personal and shared realities.
