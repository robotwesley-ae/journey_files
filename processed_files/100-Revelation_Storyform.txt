Character has a situational defect of…
Character has an intention to achieve their dreams because…
Has a thought - a hope it will come true because…
Has a thought - a fear it will not because…
Which leads them to answer the call 
And journey
And go through an ordeal whereby they attain their hope only to realize the original intention was hollow
Symbolized by the bad guys closing in (their fear) 
And then they lose all intention 
And a spark comes, a new intention or a new mode of applying that intention 
They then go to fight their fear
And lose
But then double down the motivation and win 
And return with the elixir as master of the two worlds
