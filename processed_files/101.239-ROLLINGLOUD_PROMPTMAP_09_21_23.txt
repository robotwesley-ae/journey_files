LINDA (confused) But, Kevin, that's not how it works...
CHAD (agreeing) Yeah, man, we need to embrace the festival's wild side. Let's use all the codes! Let the chaos guide us!
Kevin's frustration deepens as he realizes their confusion is only escalating.
KEVIN (defeated) Fine, have it your way. Let's use all the codes, order pizza, dance, and hope we stumble upon Zion in the process.
Linda and Chad exchange a triumphant look, their excitement momentarily overshadowing their befuddlement.
LINDA (ecstatic) Yes! Let's crack the code, find Zion, and embrace the festival's glorious madness!
CHAD (grinning) We'll be the codebreakers, man! No code will stand in our way!
With their misinterpreted codes and befuddled minds, they push through the crowd, their arguments blending with the festival's pulsating beats. In their quest for Zion, they navigate the chaotic realm of miscommunication, their shared confusion becoming an unintentional bond.

Rewrite this, but don't make jokes about what the codes mean, the codes should mean real things, or at least sound like real things.

EXT. FESTIVAL GROUNDS - ROLLING LOUD VENUE - NIGHT
Linda, high on cocaine, clicks her walkie-talkie, buzzing with excitement.
LINDA (excitedly) Okay, guys, listen up. We'll be using code 10-4 to indicate that we understand and acknowledge a message. If we hear code 10-13, that means we have a weather or road hazard. And if we hear code 10-20, that means we have a location update.
Kevin and Chad exchange confused glances, their minds foggy from the drugs.
LINDA (continuing) But wait, there's also code 10-7, which is... um, a signal for unexpected artist collaborations. And code 10-10 is like a secret code for VIP access!
CHAD (raising an eyebrow) Hold on, Linda. I thought code 10-20 was the one for backstage passes. And code 10-7? That's obviously the code for free merchandise!
KEVIN (confused) Wait, guys, I thought code 10-4 meant the festival is at maximum capacity. And code 10-13 was for medical emergencies.
LINDA (irritated) No, Kevin! We need the codes! They're crucial for communication! How can you not understand?
CHAD (dazed) Yeah, Kevin, we gotta use the right codes, man. It's like... it's like the language of the festival.
KEVIN (baffled) But with all these different codes, I can't even keep track. Are we granting access or issuing warnings?
LINDA (impatient) Kevin, don't you see? These codes will help us navigate the festival. They're like... like the keys to unlocking unforgettable experiences.
CHAD (nodding) Yeah, man, we need structure! We gotta embrace the festival's organized chaos. Let's use the codes, man!
Kevin shakes his head, trying to process their erratic conversation.
KEVIN (frustrated) Alright, alright! Let's just... let's just stick with one code. How about we use code 10-4 for general communication and safety?
LINDA (confused) But, Kevin, that's not how it works...
CHAD (agreeing) Yeah, man, we need to embrace the festival's unique language. Let's use the codes to connect with others and navigate the festivities!
Kevin's frustration deepens as he realizes their confusion is only escalating.
KEVIN (defeated) Fine, have it your way. Let's use the codes to enhance our festival experience and ensure everyone's safety.
Linda and Chad exchange a triumphant look, their excitement momentarily overshadowing their befuddlement.
LINDA (ecstatic) Yes! Let's embrace the codes, connect with others, and immerse ourselves in the festival's vibrant atmosphere!
CHAD (grinning) We'll become fluent in the festival's language, man! Let the codes guide us to unforgettable moments!
With their misinterpreted codes and befuddled minds, they push through the crowd, their arguments blending with the festival's pulsating beats. In their quest for Zion, they navigate the chaotic realm of miscommunication, their shared confusion becoming an unintentional bond.

rewrite but here is the POV. Linda should want to use the codes she presents. Chad disagrees with the
