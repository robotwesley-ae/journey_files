 do not solve duality. Although they solve relations between relatives, they do not solve duality, which is simultaneous instantiation of opposite relative poles (big/small, whatever/wherever). 

Emergent web structures, however, offer the view of the spectra with the addition of the view of its observation chain. The beauty of the EWS is that it doesn’t need to be perfect but rather construction just needs to be attempted, calibrated and optimized.

My Message to Olivus:

It will never be fully built. We have to build it as we’re going, and every time we hit it with me we have to build it better. We have to innovate and invent the transcendental solutions to the barriers every single time – that’s TWI.

In the future, there will be a point of no return, where we have entered into the region of the complex space where we cannot undo the compound effects of what we have already done, and that is the real Moloch state – when we cannot undo the the feedback loops because they’ve become too complicated and we can’t figure them out fast enough. This is similar to a lot of things people are already familiar with like bankruptcy or hyperinflation or climate change or whatever. We have to avoid this. The way to avoid it is called Sanctuary.
