The conversation takes a serious turn as they discuss their concerns.
LINDA (worried) I just hope we find Zion soon. It's been so long, and festivals can be overwhelming.
BRITTANY (curious) Who's Zion?
KEVIN (sadly) He's my son. He went missing at a festival a while back, and we've been searching for him ever since.
TIFFANY (sympathetic) That must be tough. But don't worry, you'll find him. People come together in times like this.
BRITTANY (encouraging) Yeah, there are so many volunteers and security personnel. Have you talked to them? They might have some information.
KEVIN (appreciative) We've been talking to everyone we can. It's just been a long and challenging journey.
Tension starts to build between Chad and Linda, their animosity growing more apparent.
CHAD (teasingly) So, what's your favorite thing about festivals?
LINDA (interjecting) Oh, definitely the food! I love trying all the different types of street food. It's like a culinary adventure.
KEVIN (smirking) For me, it's the sense of community. Despite the chaos, there's this feeling of togetherness and shared experiences. It's something special.
The girls shift the conversation towards social media.
TIFFANY (excited) Do you have Snapchat? Let's add each other!
KEVIN (reluctant) I don't really use Snapchat.
BRITTANY (giggling) Well, you do now! Let's sign you up.
Brittany and Tiffany take Kevin's phone and guide him through the sign-up process, adding themselves as his friends. Linda shows disinterest while Chad watches with amusement.
LINDA (disinterested) Ugh, I'll never understand Snapchat.
As the girls start sending silly photos to Kevin, he tries to relax but can't shake the weight of his wedding ring and his mission to find Zion. The tension between Chad and Linda grows.
BRITTANY (laughing) Look at these photos!
CHAD (teasing) Oh, Kevin, you're really getting into it.
Linda rolls her eyes, feeling left out. Finally, Kevin can't hold it in any longer.
KEVIN (anxious) I'm married, you know.
TIFFANY (laughing) I know, silly. That's why I gave you Snapchat!
Kevin's conflicting emotions surface as he contemplates his actions, while Linda and Chad continue to exchange sarcastic remarks. The weight of his commitment to his family and the mission to find Zion becomes increasingly heavy.
