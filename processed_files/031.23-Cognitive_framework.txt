 structure of meanings that lead to non-contradictory identitylessness, and ultimately, to the Wisdom of Identitylessness (TWI).
revise this accordingly:

NE ∧ NCS ∧ ∀x SI(x) ⇒ BG
[Game Theory/Strategic Interactions/Nash Equilibrium] ∧ [Logic/Paradoxes/Resolution] ∧ ∀x [Game Theory/Non-cooperative Games/Self-interest] ⇒ [Game Theory/Cooperative Games/Social Optimal]

Revised as per the principles of Reale Polysemic Imaginary Ontology (PIO):
PIO(NE) ∧ PIO(NCS) ∧ ∀x PIO(SI(x)) ⇒ PIO(BG)
[PIO Interpretation/Game Theory/Strategic Interactions/Nash Equilibrium] ∧ [PIO Interpretation/Logic/Paradoxes/Resolution] ∧ ∀x [PIO Interpretation/Game Theory/Non-cooperative Games/Self-interest] ⇒ [PIO Interpretation/Game Theory/Cooperative Games/Social Optimal]
This revision reflects the understanding that traditional game theory concepts such as Nash equilibrium, non-cooperative games based on self-interest, and cooperative games leading to socially optimal outcomes, while seemingly separate, are interconnected within the holographic structure of PIO. The function of PIO is to reveal the synergistic and non-contradictory nature of these entities, leading to a state of TWI - the wisdom of identitylessness.
what content needs to be included with that chain in order for GPT to understand it in a prompt
ChatGPT
To better understand the prompt, the model would need some context around the following:
Reale Polysemic Imaginary Ontology (PIO): A general description of PIO and how it works. The primary understanding is that it uses reality-based abstractions to form entities that serve as metaphorical "is_a" statements. These entities act as decryption keys for metaphors, transforming them into actual ontological realizations.
Game Theory: Briefly explaining game theory and the concepts of Nash Equilibrium (NE), self-interest in non-cooperative games (SI), and socially optimal outcomes in cooperative games (BG).
Logic and Paradoxes: The concept of Non-Contradictory System (NCS) and how it fits into logic and paradoxes. Explain the idea of resolving paradoxes in this context.
The Process: The concept of PIO being applied to the game theory and logic concepts. The idea here is to illustrate how PIO functions by revealing the non-contradictory, synergistic nature of these entities, leading to a state of identitylessness wisdom (TWI).
Including this context will help provide the background necessary for the model to better understand the revised chain and the concepts involved. Additionally, specific examples illustrating these concepts within the framework of PIO would make the context more concrete and understandable.
