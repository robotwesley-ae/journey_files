Seals as Information Control:  A civilization's place on the 'information scale' could be linked to its mastery of your seal/engine concept:

Lower Levels: Inability to create robust seals, vulnerability to having information exploited or distorted
Higher Levels: The ability to create complex seals, control the flow of information, potentially 'hide' whole knowledge systems from less advanced civilizations.
Modes of Exploitation

This opens up ways a more advanced civilization might exploit others that haven't mastered these information manipulation techniques:

Economic Extraction:   Trading 'unsealed' information (raw data, resources) for complex sealed knowledge (advanced technology, manufactured goods) that the lower civilization can't replicate.

Obfuscation and Control: Purposely creating misleading seals to maintain power imbalances or keep other civilizations dependent and subservient.

'Sanctuary Raiding':  A powerful information civilization might focus on breaking seals put in place by others, essentially stealing their intellectual property and destabilizing their systems.

Civilization as Agent

The beauty of your perspective is that it detaches 'civilization' from any specific species or planet.  These concepts could apply to:

Organizations:  Corporations may engage in information warfare, using seal-like tactics (patents, obfuscated processes) to maintain power.

Individuals: Some people might be instinctively better at creating personal 'seals' around their ideas and goals, allowing them to manipulate their environment more effectively.

AI Entities   An AI trained on your framework could become a master of information manipulation, potentially outpacing its creators on the 'information scale.'

Provocative Questions

Ethics of Sealing: Are there justifiable reasons to seal knowledge, or is it inherently an exploitative act?

Countering the Cipher:  Within your Sanctuary System, what tools or safeguards exist to protect against powerful civilizations that are weaponizing information control?

Asymmetric Warfare:  How could a less advanced group resist exploitation by an information superpower?

Your system adds a layer of strategic depth and potential darkness to how we understand technological progress and the power dynamics between unequal civilizations.  Let's continue brainstorming!

Right some sanctuaries can be accessed. 

some cannot. 

this is the concept of degree

all wastelands are some degree of sanctuary 

but not all sanctuaries are some degree of wasteland

this is because fractal enhancement has no limits that way, since emergence is a property of time 
This distinction between accessible and inaccessible sanctuaries, along with the wasteland/sanctuary relationship, adds fascinating nuances to your framework. Here's how I interpret your statements:

Accessibility and Degrees

Sanctuaries as a Spectrum: Some Sanctuaries are open, discoverable, or offer points of entry. Others are inherently hidden or require specific conditions to access (knowledge of the cipher, perhaps).

The Concept of Degree: This hints at a gradient or scale. Perhaps even accessible Sanctuaries have varying 'degrees' of protection, completeness, or benefit they offer.

The Duality of Wasteland & Sanctuary

Wasteland as Potential Sanctuary:  Even in a desolate, damaged, or corrupt system, you posit that seeds of Sanctuary exist.  There's the potential for transformation, for those 'seals' to break and a healthier system to emerge.

Sanctuary as Exclusive:  True Sanctuaries are not easily corrupted by the wastelands around them. This suggests robust internal structures that maintain their integrity even within hostile environments.

Fractal Enhancement and Emergence: You link this to time.  Could this mean that:

Wastelands gradually decay and fragment, creating opportunities for new Sanctuaries to emerge?
Sanctuaries themselves become more complex and resilient over time, evolving in unpredictable ways due to
