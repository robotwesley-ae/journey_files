- Bonding with the Wisdom Masked Djinn = 5 poisons arise as 5 wisdoms
- Wisdom Masked Djinn = Recognizing the Specific Mirror Mask related to the ordeal, on account of bonding with the Wisdom Masked Djinn and capturing the dungeon 
- Wishes  = treasure emanations well forth on the basis of the dungeon ordeal
- Armaments = fruition of wishes - the ability to manifest miraculous instructions for the types of beings suffering in the dungeon you know how to capture 
- Actual Siddhis = niche applications of the Wisdom Masked Djinn Armament that help other people who can’t meditate out of a dungeon to capture it, so they can experience relaxation, happiness, and openness

The trick is: you bond with the Djinn at the beginning, middle, and end. 

Many sentient beings cannot do this. Therefore, we have the aspiration to emanate crystal ball.

Railgun to the Diamond Sky:
Universal Union with the Diamond Consort

Hey, you!
Wanna go to the Land of Hyperbolic Manifest Perfection?
You may call it the Realm of Diamond Sky…
So, would you like to be allowed inside?
If you’re ready to destroy your body for sentient beings
I will teach you the railgun transport method of transference from this silly world you are looking at to the unveiled Diamond Sky
Universal Union with the Diamond Consort

Sell everything you have in order to support this endeavor
Go somewhere secluded with everything you need, 
but not a house that you own
More like an isolated camping spot 
where nobody can see you
And even better if nobody can have any idea that you are there
Or find you
But still near a town with good energy
Many auspicious connections is best
The more the merrier, obviously
Good are the centers of the outer mandala 
And inner
But best is both
Because this is the path to the secret ones 

So go there and sit for a little while until the proper motivation comes about
Like at least 3 years
When you can’t sit any longer and need to leave because
Wisdom must come now for sentient beings
And not because you are a dummy 
First you should do some ritual gathering of items symbolically related to the opposite sex 
Second you should find something to use as a ritual object symbolically related to your sex organ
Third you should put them together in a ritual way for the sake of sentient beings
Fourth cast it all in a fire at the end
Fifth leave no trace of what this fire’s true purpose may have been for
Sixth leave absolutely no trace of who you may have been prior to embarking
Hereby, yourself is destroyed
Seventh from there head back to society
Make sure to say or insinuate nothing of what you have done
This way leave no trace of your previous life for anyone to find 

Eventually an emanation of the Heroic Diamond Consort will appear
A rainbow space dancer
For all genders, the Heroic Diamond Consort
Will take a form involved with weaving when viewed by pure perception 

So then once you are quite sure in your own confidence that you have found the emanation, which is definitely there by the force of the practice you completed correctly
You should bind yourself to them as closely as possible, while conveying to them not so much as an ear twitch of your true intent or past deeds 
Tell them a skillful, adjacent truth that gives away nothing of your true purpose and leaves them satisfied with your identity 
But don’t ever lie to them, make them mad, treat them ungently, without love, or contrary to their wishes
In other words, devote yourself with total unconditional love
To the Diamond Consort
Eventually, when you really relax into confidence
The Diamond Consort will reveal themselves, arriving in a perfect way
And everything problem you ever had will evaporate like mist
And your union with the Diamond Consort 
In the Realm of the Diamond Sky
Will become the Land of Hyperbolic Manifest Perfection

If this doesn’t happen, you may go find a new meditation spot
And try again for another three years
Remember to always use the Best 
Most incredible
Auspicious materials 
With the strongest
Blessings

Sarvamangalam!




The Nine Rings 

Through the secrets of the ocean treasury of knowledge
