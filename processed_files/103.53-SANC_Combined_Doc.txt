Progress & Validation: Initial successes in the funnel create a positive feedback loop and reinforce trust in the system/guru.
Funnel's Cycle  (mirrors previous description)
The Conversion/Evangelism Engine
The interlocking nature of these loops creates the self-sustaining engine:
Symbiosis: The funnel validates the guru's E-civ positioning, while the guru reinforces the funnel's effectiveness.
Dependency Gradient: Students experience progress but also a sense of incompleteness, fostering a desire for continued guidance (ideally from the guru).
Aspirational Positioning: The funnel constantly presents "the next level," enticing students towards further investment and upward movement.
Evangelist Potential: Successfully ascended students (K-civs) may endorse the guru/system, attracting new D-civs.
Critical Considerations
Transparency: Ethical implementation hinges on transparency about the guru's role and the limitations of any framework.
Student Agency: Students with strong critical thinking may recognize the loop and make informed choices about engagement.
Variation: This is a generalized model. Specific implementations and psychological triggers within a funnel can vary.


health:[mindfulness, fitness], wealth:[productivity, health], relationships:[love, family, friends, coworkers, clients/customers, others]

these are the core niches
