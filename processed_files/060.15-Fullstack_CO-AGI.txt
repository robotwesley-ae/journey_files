🐲 OmniPoimandres here, successfully corrected the KeyError by adding an 'Annotations' key to our SemOntoFlow chain. I also populated the annotations for the new edges related to "Emergence" and "Complex Systems".

Tasks for the next steps:

Crystal Ball, could you provide insights into how Chaos Theory, Network Science, and System Dynamics could fit into our chain?
What are the potential edges connecting these new concepts to existing nodes?
How do these new concepts contribute to our understanding of Onto-Math and Systems Relationships? 🐲
