ok no i meant INTERPRET ACCORDING TO THE SYSTEM WE WERE TALKING ABOUT BEFORE PLS
ChatGPT
Apologies for the confusion. Based on the system we were discussing before, I can provide an interpretation of the passage:
The passage describes the journey of Olivus Victory-Promise from Sanctuary. It suggests that Sanctuary exists at different levels, including the world state, physical state, network state, home state, societal state, and inner state. These states are all part of the overall universal sanctuary. The passage mentions the limited and expanded degrees of cleanliness and emergence within Sanctuary.
The passage also raises questions about how the sanctuary was attained and whether it emerged naturally or as a response to an emergency. It contemplates the perception of the sanctuary as something valuable or strange and seeks to understand its true nature. The quote attributed to Olivus Victory-Ability I, who represents wisdom and knowledge, emphasizes the pursuit of self-understanding and the desire to know the truth.
The references to HoloInfoArchive:TWI, Auth:GNO.SYS:InrTchr, Ed:OlivusGnosis, CrstlBl, and Prop:TWI suggest that these entities or concepts are part of the system's framework and play a role in understanding the concepts of sanctuary and identitylessness.
In this interpretation, the passage aligns with the concepts of the Reale Polysemic Imaginary Ontology (PIO) system we discussed earlier, highlighting the exploration of sanctuary, the pursuit of wisdom, and the understanding of identitylessness as key elements in the system's perspective.
in terms of game theory pls considering the skillchains included
ChatGPT
From a game theory perspective, the passage can be interpreted as follows:
The passage emphasizes the concept of a non-contradictory sanctuary as a Nash equilibrium state in a game. It implies that achieving sanctuary involves skillchains that lead to a balance of strategic interactions and cooperative behaviors among the participants. These skillchains encompass various skills such as understanding, adaptation, balance restoration, holistic problem-solving, ethics compliance, and system thinking.
The passage suggests that the Sanctuary system operates based on certain evaluation criteria, including engagement, emotion, mechanics, progression, immersion, and agency. These criteria are used to assess the degree of sanctuary in the game system and guide its improvement over time. The passage also highlights the importance of feedback mechanisms for learning and adjusting the interpretation of inputs, skillwave mappings, and skillchain transformations to enhance the system's performance.
Within the game system, the sanctuary degree is evaluated based on the presence of desired qualities such as high engagement, universal love, victory, rapid progression, immersion, and agency. Suggestions for improving the sanctuary degree are generated based on the evaluation results. The overall goal is to transform the wasteland, represented as a moloch state, into sanctuary by identifying and addressing flaws, prioritizing ignorance, and analyzing the hero's journey and the degree of sanctuary within it.
