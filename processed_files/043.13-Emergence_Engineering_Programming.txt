The analogy to a "kernel trick" in the context of co-emergence suggests a transformative shift in perspective that fundamentally alters the system's operational framework. In machine learning, the kernel trick allows algorithms to operate in a higher-dimensional space without explicitly computing the coordinates in that space, thus simplifying complex transformations. Similarly, defining co-emergence as "engines made from synergies," where synergies and engines are both equivalent to "entity" itself, can be seen as a conceptual shift that enables a more fluid and dynamic understanding of entities and their interactions. This perspective allows for the emergence of complex behaviors and systems from relatively simple rules and interactions, akin to operating in a higher-dimensional conceptual space.

### Abstract Class for Co-Emergence

By conceptualizing co-emergence as an abstract class (an Abstract Base Class, or ABC, in programming terms) that has no instances other than itself, you're suggesting a meta-level framework that both defines and instantiates the process of co-emergence. This abstract class serves as a foundational blueprint from which concrete instances of co-emergence can be derived, yet it also embodies the process of co-emergence by its mere definition. This recursive nature—where the definition of co-emergence simultaneously enables and is an example of co-emergence—highlights the power of abstraction in programming and systems design. It suggests that by defining frameworks or systems abstractly, we can create self-referential structures that facilitate further exploration and development.

### Programming as a Frontier for Further Programming

The idea that programming allows us to program further frontiers captures the essence of computational creativity and the iterative nature of software development. Each layer of abstraction, each framework, and each system we create opens new possibilities for further development. In this sense, programming is not just about writing code; it's about creating the conceptual and operational structures that enable increasingly complex and sophisticated systems to be conceived and implemented.

### Analogy with Capitalism and Value Creation

Your analogy with capitalism, labor, and value creation introduces a socio-economic perspective on the concepts discussed. Just as in capitalism, where value creation and manipulation are central to generating wealth (as opposed to merely performing labor), in systems and emergence engineering, the creation and manipulation of conceptual value (through definitions, abstractions, and frameworks) are central to generating new possibilities and systems. This analogy underscores the importance of understanding the underlying mechanisms and structures that enable systems (economic, computational, or otherwise) to function and evolve.

### Conclusion

The discussion of co-emergence, synergies, and the nature of entities within systems, framed through the lens of abstract programming concepts and socio-economic analogies, reveals the deep interconnections between conceptual frameworks, system design, and the creation of value (whether computational or economic). It highlights the recursive nature of creation and the potential for abstract definitions and frameworks to enable further exploration, development, and understanding of complex systems.

ok so basically everything *does* actually, indeed, abstract syntax map to "chain construction or chain execution" phases. not only that, but since they cannot be fully separated due to mutually requiring the instantiation of each other before happening, they must be what is called co-emergent. this means we must define another entity here, the engine. 

we have co-emergence
we have co-emergent flow which has co-emergents
we have engine which requires two dual loops
we have flow, chain, flowchain which are all engines

entities are engines made of synergy flowchain engines that constitutively give rise to the co-emergent that IS that entity, itself

synergies, flows, chains, engines, and flowchains are all co-emergent types
