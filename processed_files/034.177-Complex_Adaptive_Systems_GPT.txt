 GPT, on the other hand, is trained as a generative model, where it must predict the next token in the sequence given the previous tokens.
During training, the model's weights, including the input embeddings, are updated using an optimization algorithm like Adam or stochastic gradient descent to minimize the loss function. As a result, the learned embeddings capture not only semantic and syntactic information but also the complex relationships between tokens and their contexts, which allows the model to perform better on various natural language understanding tasks.
In summary, advanced Transformer-based models like BERT or GPT learn embeddings as part of their architecture, allowing them to better capture contextual information and achieve better performance on natural language understanding tasks compared to using pre-trained embeddings like Word2Vec.


explain part 4 in great detail
Part 4 of the explanation focuses on the Transformer layers, which are the core components of Transformer-based models like BERT or GPT. Let's dive deeper into the architecture and workings of these layers.
A Transformer model consists of multiple layers, often referred to as "blocks" or "encoder/decoder layers" depending on the specific model. Each layer contains two primary components: a multi-head self-attention mechanism and a position-wise feed-forward network. The input embeddings are passed through these layers, which help the model to learn complex relationships between tokens and their contexts. Let's break down each component:
Multi-Head Self-Attention Mechanism:
The self-attention mechanism allows the model to weigh the importance of different parts of the input sequence when processing a specific token. It does this by computing attention scores between each token and all other tokens in the sequence. The scores determine how much each token should contribute to the final representation of the current token being processed.
The multi-head aspect of the self-attention mechanism means that multiple attention mechanisms are run in parallel, each with its own set of weights. These multiple "heads" can attend to different parts of the sequence or focus on different aspects of the input, providing a richer representation of the sequence.
The process can be broken down into the following steps:
a. Query, Key, and Value Vectors: Each input token is projected into three different vectors called the query, key, and value vectors. These vectors are computed using three different learned weight matrices.
b. Attention Scores: The attention scores are computed by taking the dot product between the query vector of the current token and the key vector of all other tokens, followed by a scaling operation and a softmax function. This results in a probability distribution that represents the importance of each token in the context of the current token.
c. Weighted Sum: The value vectors are then multiplied by the attention scores and summed up to obtain the final output for each token. This output is a weighted combination of the value vectors, where tokens with higher attention scores contribute more to the final representation.
Position-wise Feed-Forward Network:
After the multi-head self-attention mechanism, the output for each token is passed through a position-wise feed-forward network (FFN). The FFN is a simple feed-forward neural network that consists of two linear layers with a non-linear activation function, like ReLU, in between.
The purpose of the position-wise FFN is to apply a non-linear transformation to the output of the self-attention mechanism for each token separately. This allows the model to learn more complex patterns and relationships in the input sequence.
