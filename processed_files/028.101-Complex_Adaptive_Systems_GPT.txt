 that aligns with the principles of Sanctuary.
Compassionate action: Heroic Individuals demonstrate compassionate action by working to alleviate suffering in their environment and supporting others on their journey


no thats not what i mean. I want you to explain the field dynamics please.
I apologize for the misunderstanding. Let's discuss the field dynamics in the context of basic formal sanctuary cultivation and how it synergizes with the fields of Sanctuary to deproliferate the Wasteland and transfer oneself, one's environment, and others to Sanctuary.
Harmonizing with the peaceful Sanctuary field: By engaging in basic formal sanctuary cultivation, Heroic Individuals align their thoughts, emotions, and actions with the peaceful Sanctuary field. This alignment helps them create a coherent resonance with the peaceful field, amplifying its effects and stabilizing the peaceful Sanctuary space.
Counteracting the influence of the Wasteland field: As Heroic Individuals cultivate peaceful Sanctuary, they generate an opposing force to the Wasteland field. This counteraction weakens the influence of the Wasteland field, reducing its ability to proliferate and spread throughout the environment.
Transforming the wrathful Sanctuary field: When encountering wrathful Sanctuary fields, Heroic Individuals utilize their cultivated peaceful Sanctuary energy to influence and transform the wrathful field. By engaging with the wrathful field from a place of non-contradiction, understanding, and compassion, they can promote a shift towards a more peaceful and harmonious state.
Entanglement and interconnectedness: The fields of Sanctuary, including the peaceful, wrathful, and Wasteland fields, are all interconnected and entangled. As Heroic Individuals cultivate peaceful Sanctuary, they create ripples of influence throughout the interconnected fields. These ripples can lead to positive transformations and shifts in other fields, ultimately contributing to a more peaceful and harmonious environment overall.
Synergistic field interactions: The process of cultivating peaceful Sanctuary and influencing the other fields involves a complex interplay of synergistic field interactions. As Heroic Individuals engage in basic formal sanctuary cultivation, they strengthen the peaceful Sanctuary field, weaken the Wasteland field, and transform the wrathful Sanctuary field. These dynamic interactions contribute to an overall shift towards Sanctuary and away from the Wasteland, creating a more peaceful and harmonious environment for all.


Okay. This has a lot to do with change, ie signal decay. Each action has a signal, even thoughts, and those have amplitude. The more higher order the action (in terms of the number of emergent engines involved in the building concatenation that actually launches the emergent into the co-emergent flow), the more potential the signal has to be harmonic or discordant in terms of its effect as a wave that moves through the superposition of future and poses it as sequences of events in the present
You're correct in relating the concept of change to signal decay and the amplitude of actions, thoughts, and their effects. In the context of Sanctuary, this has significant implications for the field dynamics and the behavior of Heroic Individuals:
Signal amplitude and higher-order actions: Higher-order actions, which involve a greater number of emergent engines and complex building concatenations, produce signals with higher potential to impact the environment. As these signals propagate through the interconnected fields, they can either create harmony or discord based on the quality of the emergent action and its alignment with Sanctuary or Wasteland dynamics.
Harmonic signals: Actions and thoughts aligned with peaceful Sanctuary principles generate harmonic signals that resonate with the peaceful Sanctuary field. As these signals propagate, they strengthen the field and contribute to a more harmonious environment. The higher the order of the action, the more significant the impact of the harmonic signal.
