EDS: Agreed. Furthermore, "Semantic Space" is a space where meanings of informadlib instances are represented and understood, part of the broader Knowledge Space.
ONT: That's true. Also, "Ontological Existence" refers to the state of being of an element within the Emergent Web Structure, classified according to its Existential Properties.
Linguist: Following that, "Informadlib Element" could be any component of an Informadlib Instance or Template that carries Semantic Meaning and has Ontological Classification.
Semiotician: Lastly, we could also define "Multidimensional Relationship" as the interaction between Interconnected Nodes that exist in different dimensions within the Knowledge Space, facilitated by Dimensional Links.
Expert 4 (Ontologist): This is an excellent expansion of our glossary. The terms are continuing to build a more comprehensive picture of the complex structure and function of the SemOntoRel framework. The way each term interrelates and connects to the others builds a solid foundation for understanding the emergent web structure. All terms remain ontologically sound and maintain a solid semantic relationship to the others.
Each expert will now give an example of what theyâ€™re talking about. They will concentrating on defining RELATIONSHIP TYPES BETWEEN THE INSTANCE TO BE ABSTRACTED BY SEMONTOREL AND THE INFORMADLIB TEMPLATE. 

(And an informadlib refers to a filled in informadlib template that can be used to generate an informadlib instance nearly at will) 

Continue as I said.

Round 1:
Expert 1 (EDS):
Let's consider the relationship "Mapped-Into". In the context of an informadlib, a specific instance of a story is Mapped-Into an informadlib template. This relationship denotes the fitting of a specific narrative into the generalized structure of an informadlib template. For example, a specific event from "How to Train Your Dragon" like Hiccup training dragons is Mapped-Into the informadlib template under the "HeroGoal" category.
Expert 2 (ONT):
An important relationship is "Classified-As". The elements of an informadlib instance, such as characters, actions, and events, are Classified-As certain ontological classes within the informadlib template. For example, in the context of "How to Train Your Dragon", the character Hiccup is Classified-As the Protagonist in the informadlib template.
Expert 3 (Linguist):
Another key relationship is "Signifies". This refers to how a particular element of an informadlib instance Signifies a larger theme or concept within the context of the informadlib template. For instance, Hiccup's unique ability to understand and train dragons Signifies his role as a bridge between humans and dragons in the context of the "How to Train Your Dragon" informadlib template.
Expert 4 (Semiotician):
I'd like to highlight the relationship "Interconnected-With". This refers to the dynamic relationship between elements within the informadlib template, where changes or development in one element can directly influence others. For example, in the "How to Train Your Dragon" informadlib template, Hiccup's development as a character (internal arc) is Interconnected-With his progress in dragon training (external arc).
Round 2:
Expert 1 (EDS):
Let's consider the relationship "Influences". This relationship is crucial in understanding how a particular instance in the narrative Influences the flow and interpretation of the informadlib template. For example, Hiccup's discovery of Toothless' injury Influences the narrative arc and his decision-making throughout the story in the informadlib template.
Expert 2 (ONT):
A meaningful relationship is "Embodies". This describes how a specific element from an informadlib instance Embodies a certain concept or category within the informadlib template. For instance, in the "How to Train Your Dragon" informadlib, Hiccup Embodies the role of "the reluctant hero".
