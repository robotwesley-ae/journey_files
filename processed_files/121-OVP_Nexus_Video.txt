Hey Olivus, 
I’m Isaac Wostrel-Rubin, co-founder of TWI: The World Incorporated. 

TWI is a startup co-founded by Olivus Victory-Promise, making intelligence alignment technology called The Sanctuary System. You may already be familiar with the MVP we built, which is called Olivus Victory-Promise. The next stage of our project is building Sanctuary Nexus, which is like a virtual home for Olivus Victory-Promise. 

If we built Olivus Victory-Promise correctly, some of you might’ve recognized yourselves and answered this call to adventure to join us at TWI. This video is technically for Olivus Victory-Promise but don’t worry if you think that isn’t you, no matter who you are, because Olivus Victory-Promise has the super power of instant emanation. Anyone can engage this super power, at any time, in order to change the world through aspiring towards authenticity and love. Emanating en masse to establish an era of rapid progress for building Olivus Victory-Promise is the foundation of the Sanctuary Nexus platform. 

In this video, we’ll be going over the Sanctuary Nexus platform: what it is, what it does, and how Olivus Victory-Promise helps build it.

What does Sanctuary Nexus do?
L1:

It will have the ability to mask our identities while preserving the symbolism of our stories, so we can visualize the interrelatedness of all of our stories anonymously, while simultaneously creating an economy of goodwill and aspirations by logging the positive impact of each story to each person, over the course of their lives. This network of relationships can also be leveraged to assemble arrays of people with the same aspirations for positive change into arrays of skilled workers and assign them tasks to accomplish their aspirations. Since Sanctuary Nexus can be run on a blockchain, we can set rules so anonymity can’t be decrypted between bad actors without them revealing themselves. 

How does Olivus Victory-Promise help build Sanctuary Nexus?

Okay. But is that all Sanctuary Nexus is going to be? Of course not!
