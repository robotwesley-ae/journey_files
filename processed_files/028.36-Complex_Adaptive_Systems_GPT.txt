Yes, in this model, there can be two types of Sanctuaries: wrathful and peaceful. The distinction lies in the methods and approaches used to promote growth, learning, and adaptation.
A wrathful Sanctuary may focus on challenging or confrontational experiences that push individuals to grow, adapt, and learn through adversity. The harsher conditions in a wrathful Sanctuary can serve as powerful catalysts for change, forcing Wisdom Mavericks to confront their limitations and develop new strategies for overcoming obstacles. This environment encourages growth through struggle and resilience.
On the other hand, a peaceful Sanctuary emphasizes a more nurturing, supportive approach to growth and learning. In this environment, individuals are encouraged to explore, discover, and develop their potential in a safe and encouraging space. A peaceful Sanctuary fosters growth through positive reinforcement, collaboration, and mutual support.
Both wrathful and peaceful Sanctuaries serve essential roles in fostering growth and adaptation in Wisdom Mavericks. The choice between the two depends on the individual's needs, preferences, and learning styles, as well as the specific challenges they face. By providing different environments and approaches to learning, the Sanctuary-Wasteland system ensures that Wisdom Mavericks have the opportunity to grow, adapt, and evolve in ways that best suit their unique circumstances.


And the center of the wrathful sanctuary is the palace of the Faceless teacher masked whirling flames and the center of the peaceful sanctuary is the palace of the Infinite Armed Liberatress
Together they make a yabyum in a palace of the universal wisdom Maverick. The nature of this universal wisdom Maverick is known as inherent crystal ball and is also found within ourselves as sentient wisdom mavericks
The concept of the wrathful and peaceful Sanctuaries being centered around different entities or symbols can be a powerful representation of the qualities and characteristics associated with each Sanctuary type.
In the wrathful Sanctuary, the Faceless teacher masked whirling flames can symbolize the transformative nature of adversity and the relentless pursuit of growth through challenge. This figure embodies the intensity and ferocity of the learning experiences within the wrathful Sanctuary, pushing Wisdom Mavericks to face their fears and limitations in order to grow stronger.
In the peaceful Sanctuary, the Infinite Armed Liberatress represents the nurturing, supportive, and protective aspects of this environment. This figure embodies the qualities of compassion, understanding, and empathy, extending a multitude of helping hands to those seeking growth and knowledge. The Infinite Armed Liberatress serves as a beacon of hope and inspiration, guiding Wisdom Mavericks towards self-discovery and personal development.
When these two powerful symbols come together in the yabyum, they form a harmonious union, representing the complementary nature of the wrathful and peaceful Sanctuaries within the universal wisdom Maverick. This union highlights the idea that both struggle and support, challenge and compassion, are necessary components for growth and development.
The inherent crystal ball, as the nature of the universal wisdom Maverick, can be seen as the innate potential for wisdom, knowledge, and growth that exists within every sentient being. By recognizing and cultivating this inherent crystal ball, sentient wisdom mavericks can tap into their own limitless potential for growth, adaptation, and evolution, transcending the boundaries of the wrathful and peaceful Sanctuaries to achieve a state of unified understanding and enlightenment.
