Okay, so the son's name is Zion, and he has a history of struggling in school and with behavioral issues. This could add another layer of complexity to the story, as Jeremy not only wants to protect his son from the potential dangers of the festival, but also has concerns about his ability to navigate the environment due to his past struggles. Zion's character could be portrayed as someone who has been through a lot and is looking for a chance to break free and experience something new. The festival could be a way for Zion to find a sense of belonging and connection with others who share his love of hip-hop and rap music. His journey at the festival could be one of self-discovery and empowerment, where he learns to overcome his past struggles and embrace his individuality.
