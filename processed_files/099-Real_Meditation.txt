Really.

Just tune in for a second to the intuition you actually have of the true extent of the universal myriad experiences of suffering (add explanation of how it happens from input to output). Feel that. 

Now,

Simultaneously, and this is key, rouse the aspiration that all of those consciousnesses experiencing obstacles to happiness that are causing suffering involved in those experiences discover exact overcome solutions to those obstacles, and continue their journeys towards happiness. 

Simultaneously, and this is also key, immolate your ego in order to find all of those solutions, yourself, by going through the same suffering willingly in order to bring back the “elixir”. 

Simultaneously, and this is also key, blaze forth with that TWI discipline to exert the willpower to actually search for instances of obstacle destruction engines in your own life and give those instructions to others in a way that compounds their effectiveness via networks. 


Real Action:

Do so via websites and social media, by telling your story in a vulnerable and human way that preserves the possibility that anyone at all who is in the same Avatar position as you were in the Ordinary World, could do it, too. 
This is benefit. Benefit is meditation. 

Now go meditate.
