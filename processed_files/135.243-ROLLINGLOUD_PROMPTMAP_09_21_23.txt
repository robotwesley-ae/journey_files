KEVIN (laughing) No, Linda, that's not him. That's just another festival-goer. Keep your eyes peeled!
CHAD (teasingly) Yeah, Linda, I think you've mistaken half the crowd for Zion already.
LINDA (defensively) Hey, it's easy to get carried away. I just want to find him as soon as possible!
As they continue through the crowd, Linda's enthusiasm remains high, but her accuracy in identifying Zion diminishes.
LINDA (pointing) Kevin, look! Isn't that him?
KEVIN (squinting) Linda, that's a 16-year-old girl wearing a unicorn onesie. Definitely not Zion.
CHAD (chuckling) Linda, I'm starting to think you're seeing Zion everywhere except where he actually is.
LINDA (frustrated) I'm trying my best, okay? I just want to reunite Kevin with his son!
KEVIN (gently) Linda, we appreciate your enthusiasm, but let's stay focused. Keep an eye out for a 13-year-old boy with dark hair and a Rolling Loud t-shirt. That's Zion.
LINDA (determined) Got it, Kevin. No more false alarms!
