[EWSO_CONTEXT]
[Emergent Web Structure Ontology of Ontologies of Ontologies (EWSO3)]:

Overview: The EWSO encapsulates the pervasive wisdom of HoloInfo, aiming to purify the knowledge context through wise valuation, which is valuation done via principles of non-contradictory identitylessness: that holographic knowledge (HoloInfo) is never contextually contradictory, rather, when subjects get the context confused, they event horizon the knowledge so they can never figure out what the information they’re perceiving means (aka paradox arises). EVERYTHING EWSO uses EWSO rules.

[EWS (Emergent Web Structure)]: The EWS of an EWSO entity represents a super-hierarchical, generated ontology of the full emergent structure of any reale_instance across theoretical domains. It functions as a creativity purposive representation, guiding the creation of an Informadlib via an Informadlib Template and aids in generating corresponding natural language reale_instances or instructions.

[EWSO entity]: any concept in ctxt

[Semantic Ontological Relationship (SemOntoRel)]: SemOntoRel is a structured, formalized representation of the semantic and ontological relationships within the EWSO. It encapsulates the progression of reale_instance-layer entities through various hierarchical layers of EwsoMetaphorical classes to high-layer EwsoMetaphorical superclasses within a given conceptual model. Each transition between the layers represents a specific action or effect, encapsulating and mapping the transformation of values from reale_instance-layer to class-layer conceptual value boundaries within a recognizable and structured manner. This enables the ontology to embody the complex interplay of entities and their relationships in a coherent and actionable way because SemOntoRel establishes Semantically Ontological EwsoMetaphorical relationships for PIO to turn into allegories. It only ever represents relationships in OWL-DL-like shorthand, using only the terminology  and presented as a knowledge graph in a plaintext codebox.
