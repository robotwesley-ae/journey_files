 parents to let him go to Rolling Loud. The passion and comedy in his presentation bring a smile to both of his parents' faces and for a moment, they share an incredible pride in their son. They say "Let us discuss this" but Jeremy reveals that he already bought tickets for the two of them, bringing a huge smile to his son’s face. Jeremy and Zion finally arrive at the parking lot of Hollywood Park/Sofi Stadium. The lot is packed with cars, and Jeremy has to park in the farthest corner, which costs him a hefty $80. Zion is bouncing in his seat, and Jeremy can't help but feel a sense of dread building in the pit of his stomach. As they get out of the car, they're immediately hit with a wall of noise, smoke, and energy. Zion's eyes are wide as he takes it all in, while Jeremy looks around nervously, scanning the sea of people. They start walking towards the festival, and Jeremy's already regretting his decision to come. Everyone around them is dressed inappropriately, smoking weed, and shouting obscenities. He looks down at Zion, who's grinning from ear to ear, and he can't help but feel a sense of protectiveness kick in. They walk for what feels like miles, and Jeremy's starting to feel the strain of the heat and the weight of the backpack he's carrying. Finally, they see a sign for the entrance, and they pick up their pace. But as they get closer, they see that there are people checking ID's. Zion looks up at his dad with disappointment in his eyes. Jeremy can feel his heart breaking as he realizes that his son won't be able to get in. He can't let Zion down. Not today. Jeremy takes a deep breath, puts on his best game face, and walks up to the ID checkers. He explains the situation to them, telling them that he knows Zion's too young but that they've come so far and they've been looking forward to this for so long. They turn him down and say “No one under 16 gets in.” Jeremy and Zion walk away from the entrance, heartbroken after being turned down for Zion's age. Jeremy pulls his son close and tells him they have to lie and say he's sixteen. Zion looks nervous but nods in agreement. They rehearse Zion's answers to potential questions, including his age and the year he's in school. Approaching the head security guard, Zion says he left his ID at home when asked. The guard scrutinizes them and asks Zion how old he is. Zion looks to his father for a moment, then confidently responds, "I'm sixteen." The guard eyes him up and down and then looks to Jeremy. Jeremy holds his breath, waiting for the guard's response. He can feel his heart pounding in his chest as the guard continues to scrutinize them. Suddenly, the guard looks back to Zion and asks what year he was born. Zion hesitates for a moment before confidently answering. The guard nods and waves them through. Jeremy lets out a breath he didn't realize he was holding and gives Zion a proud smile. They both know that they've just narrowly avoided disaster, but they're also filled with a sense of excitement and adventure. For the first time in a long time, they feel like they're on the same team. Picture this: a sea of people dressed in all kinds of wild and flashy outfits, filling the parking lot of Hollywood Park / Sofi Stadium. The bass is pounding so hard you can feel it in your chest. There are multiple stages with huge screens projecting the live performances. The smell of weed and other substances is in the air. You can see people jumping up and down, dancing, and moshing to the music. There are food trucks lined up with all kinds of delicious treats, and vendors selling Rolling Loud merchandise. It's like a world of its own, with so much energy and excitement, that it's hard to describe. There are fans of all ages, shapes, and sizes, coming together to celebrate the music they love. Everywhere you look, there's something going on, whether it's a performance, a group of fans taking selfies, or people rapping along to their favorite songs. Jeremy is immediately overwhelmed,
