Here are a few potential set pieces for the movie:
The guys trying to sneak into the festival: This could involve them coming up with creative ways to bypass security, such as disguising themselves as staff or climbing over a fence.
The guys getting lost in the festival: Once they're inside, they could get separated or lost in the massive crowd, leading to comical encounters with other festival-goers.
The guys trying to find Zion: This could involve them talking to anyone and everyone they come across, from security guards to random strangers, in a desperate attempt to locate Jeremy's son.
The guys getting into trouble: Whether it's accidentally starting a fight with a group of bros or getting caught smoking weed in a no-smoking zone, the guys could find themselves in hot water at various points in the movie.
The guys bonding with unexpected characters: As in the scene with Shenseea, the guys could find themselves forming unexpected friendships or alliances with other festival-goers, leading to hilarious interactions and unlikely teamwork.
The guys trying to leave the festival: Once they've found Zion, they could face obstacles trying to leave the festival, such as getting stuck in traffic or accidentally wandering into the wrong parking lot.
These set pieces could be interwoven throughout the movie to create a series of escalating challenges and obstacles for the main characters to overcome.

Here are a few potential set pieces that could be used in the movie:
The Glow Stick Incident: Chad's attempt to distract security by shoving a glow stick up his butt and running around could become a hilarious and outrageous moment. This could be a turning point in the film, where things start to go completely off the rails.
The VIP Section: Once Jeremy and Chad get into the VIP section, they're surrounded by celebrities and all sorts of debauchery. This could lead to a series of outrageous moments, such as Jeremy accidentally spilling a drink on a famous rapper or Chad hitting on a celebrity's significant other.
The Costume Shop: When Jeremy and Chad realize they need clothes to get into the VIP section, they head to the festival's merchandise shop. But all that's left are ridiculously expensive Rolling Loud outfits. This could lead to a scene where Jeremy is forced to try on a series of increasingly ridiculous outfits, each one more embarrassing than the last.
The Car Chase: At some point in the film, Jeremy and Chad will need to track down Zion. This could lead to a high-speed car chase through the streets of Miami, with the duo careening through traffic and narrowly avoiding disaster.
The After-Party: Once they find Zion, the group heads to an after-party where things really start to get wild. This could lead to a series of outrageous moments, such as Chad getting into a dance-off with a professional dancer or Jeremy accidentally starting a fight with a member of a rival crew.

Sure, here are some more set piece ideas:
Kevin and Chad sneak into a restricted area and end up on stage during a performance. They're mistaken for part of the act and have to improvise a dance routine to avoid being kicked off.
Kevin and Chad accidentally stumble into a rap battle and get challenged to participate. They have to come up with witty rhymes on the spot while also trying to avoid offending anyone in the crowd.
