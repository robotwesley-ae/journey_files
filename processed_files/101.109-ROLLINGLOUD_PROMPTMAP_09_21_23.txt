KEVIN Thanks, Carti... But I... I screwed up. Endangered my son's life, twice. My wife’s probably going to file for divorce... and Child Services... They won't let me see him again. He’ll get some step dad who’s great at math, and Zion will forget about me... My friends are stuck in festival jail... and my job...
Kevin's voice trails off, swallowed by the enormity of his predicament. Carti, however, remains unfazed.
KEVIN (CONT'D) I'm supposed to sell this new line of smart baby furniture. It’s all about new technology, bluetooth and stuff. I feel like I’m being phased out from the only thing I know.
PLAYBOI CARTI That sounds cool. Where you working?
KEVIN Raymour and Flannagan.
PLAYBOI CARTI Raymour and Flannagan? That's quality stuff, man.
KEVIN Really?
PLAYBOI CARTI Yeah. You see all this furniture around here?
Kevin looks around and recognition dawns on his face.
KEVIN Oh... Yeah, that’s our RF 267 loveseat. I was there when they designed it.
PLAYBOI CARTI Now that's rockstar shit.
Carti turns to a BURLY BODYGUARD, signaling him over.
PLAYBOI CARTI (CONT'D) (to Burly Bodyguard) Ty, my man Kevin here is going through some stuff. He needs a little help. Can you handle it?
Rewrite the following scene: Kevin searches with Chad still tailing him. His phone BUZZES. He grabs it, hoping it’s Zion, but... KEVIN Shit! It’s Melanie. He sends it to VOICE MAIL. It BUZZES again. And again... KEVIN Sonofabitch! He picks up and feigns calm. KEVIN Hi, hon! EXT. NICE RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS Melanie, in a nice dress, calls Kevin. MELANIE Hi. Did you make it? INTERCUT WITH: EXT. ROLLING LOUD VENUE - SAME KEVIN Yeah. We’re here. MELANIE Never got a text? KEVIN Sorry. The cell phone situation is super spotty. But we’re here. MELANIE How’s Zion? KEVIN Great! So good to be here. I knew he’d be happy once we got here. MELANIE Can I say hi? KEVIN He’s... swimming. In the lake. Night swimming. Havin’ a blast. I’m waving to him right now, he’s waving back. (to fake Zion) It’s Mommy! MELANIE By himself? KEVIN No. I just came out to... pee? MELANIE Why didn’t you just pee in the lake? KEVIN Um... Because I wanted to grill us up some hot dogs. MELANIE That old grill still works? KEVIN Yeah... amazing. Picked up some charcoal, cleaned it up.... MELANIE Why’s that music so loud? KEVIN Uh... you know how Zion likes to hear the music while he’s swimming. MELANIE Well Okay. I don’t want to take away from your bonding time. Give him a big kiss for me. KEVIN Will do. Hope you’re having fun over there. Don’t worry about us. Bye! He hangs up. KEVIN Shit... Fuck... fuck... fuck!!!! CHAD Your wife sounds hot.

INT. ROLLING LOUD FESTIVAL - NIGHT
Kevin frantically scans the crowd, Chad shadowing him. His phone BUZZES, jolting him. Expecting it to be Zion, he checks...
KEVIN Damn it!
It's a call from Melanie. He quickly diverts it to voicemail. But the phone BUZZES again... and again...
KEVIN Son of a...
Unable to ignore it any longer, he reluctantly answers, plastering on a false calmness.
KEVIN Hey, hon!
EXT. UPSCALE RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS
Melanie, elegantly dressed, holds her phone to her ear.
MELANIE Hey. Made it to the lake okay?
INTERCUT WITH:
EXT. ROLLING LOUD FESTIVAL - SAME
Kevin keeps up the charade.
KEVIN Yeah. We're here.
MELANIE No text?
KEVIN Cell service's a bit patchy. But we made it safe.
MELANIE And Zion?
KEVIN Great! Having a fantastic time, just like I thought.
MELANIE Can I speak with him?
KEVIN He's... uh... swimming. Night swimming. He's loving it. Actually, he's waving at me right now.
(faking) Hey Zion! Mom's on the phone!
MELANIE He's swimming alone?
KEVIN No, no. I just stepped out to... um... make some hot dogs.
MELANIE And why's the music so loud?
KEVIN Uh... you know Zion. Loves his music while he swims.
MELANIE Alright, don't let me interrupt your bonding. Give him a big kiss for me.
KEVIN Absolutely. Hope your evening's going well. Bye!
He ends the call, his calm facade crumbling instantly.
KEVIN Oh, damn... Damn... damn... damn!!!!
Chad, still by his side, grins widely.
CHAD Your wife sounds hot.
