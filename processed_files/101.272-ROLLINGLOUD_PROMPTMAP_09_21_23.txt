Kevin quickly ends the call, feeling a mix of relief and guilt. The girls continue their flirtatious behavior, making inappropriate comments, unaware of Kevin's divided attention. But Kevin's focus shifts to his phone as it vibrates with notifications from Zion's Snapchat account.
He frantically opens the app, his heart racing with anticipation. His eyes scan through the messages, his finger swiping feverishly until he finally comes across a picture of Zion, captured in mid-air, surrounded by a large crowd of festival-goers.
KEVIN (excitedly) Guys, look! It's Zion!

TIFFANY (laughing) He's got some moves, just like his dad!
LINDA (trying to contain her excitement) That's amazing! He's really enjoying the festival.
CHAD (smiling) Looks like Zion's a natural performer, just like his old man.
As they marvel at the photo, Kevin's mind quickly pieces together an explanation for the unexpectedly strong phone service in this area.
KEVIN (realization) You know what? This festival must have set up temporary cell towers to handle the massive influx of people. That's probably why we have such great signal here.

TIFFANY (teasingly) Maybe they did it just for you, Kevin. So you could find your son and dance your heart out.
Kevin blushes, feeling a mix of gratitude and newfound hope.

The group exchanges smiles, sensing the significance of this unexpected stroke of luck.
