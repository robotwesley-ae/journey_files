necessitates hero do something totally different than the norm (can’t use emotions to make Riley feel anything but Joy needs to change status quo and put sadness in charge) and also initiate the showdown once and for all 
Dig deep down 
Death and resurrection 
Ultimate boon 
Return 
Master of the two worlds - multicolored memories, multicolor console
Freedoms to live 
Final proof


Contemporary hero journey: 

Born into capitalist Wasteland
Call to adventure is bringing spirituality back to the world
Have to overcome threshold guardians of caring about money
Have to learn spirituality
Small Attainment
Collapse into history, science, and psychology 
All is Lost contradiction destroys spirituality
Spark of noncontradictoriness destroys non-spirituality - all is seen as emergent
Major Attainment - able to improvise
Return - Bring the transmission
Refusal - Which requires money
Writing the book in the melodious voice of Brahma 
Return with elixir - Change society
Become a threshold guardian
But now, there is a new type of emanation, which plays the role of supernatural aid for those answering and refusing the call to adventure
Must have new business ethics and new patriotism, which are the replacements for everyday spirituality
Symbols can’t come from consciousness, they come from unconscious and are brought into consciousness by its own wisdom, which is revealed by a hero to themselves through the hero’s journey 

2nd Amendment type story - TV show - hr long miniseries?
Good Guy with a gun puts an end to a school shooting in which his daughter is killed 
But struggles with his identity as a gun lover as the suffering of the children is ignored and his actions are politicized by the right into policy to put guns in school 
He becomes very valuable within the party 
But slowly realizes the game everyone is playing with the public (voters), ignoring the truth for the sake of profits and power
And ends up killing a corrupt republican, displaying the original intention of the second amendment 


Notes

Two subtypes of the hero’s journey: 

“If the God is a tribal, racial, national, or sectarian archetype, we are the warriors of his cause; but if he is a lord of the universe itself, we then go forth as knowers to whom all men are brothers.”

The coming-of-age, growth-in-society story 
The universal-realization story

Simplified heros journey
There is a task at hand [because of the state of the world] 
Hero lying to themselves because of a wound attempts the task because of a want and fails
And then learns something about themself [that is key to the growth of the parts of themselves they will need to defeat the big bad] and gain the tools they need to complete the task
Over and over until all the parts are accumulated

Hero enters the ordeal 
Win their want
Which causes 
bad guys close in and antagonist fights hero to a draw 
Woman as temptress revelation
all is lost because they still have not entered central gnosis of their need 
Self realization and actualization of Apotheosis
Finale where they complete the task in their way and the world problem is solved
“This is the meaning of the image of the bisexual god. He is the mystery of the theme of initiation. We are taken from the mother, chewed into fragments, and assimilated to the world-annihilating body of the ogre for whom all the precious forms and beings are only the courses of a feast; but then, miraculously reborn, we are more than we were.”

What is he actually talking about? What is the complete temple initiation journey metaphor?
