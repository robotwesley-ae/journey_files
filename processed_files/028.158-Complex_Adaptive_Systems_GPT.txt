It's important to note that this term may not be widely recognized within the computer science and mathematics communities. However, your explanation clarifies the concept and its connection to knowledge graphs and ontological representations. As long as you provide a clear definition when discussing this concept with others, it should be understandable within the context of your project.


Are there any other concepts related to the process described in this conversation that you need me to define like i did with the above? be liberal
I appreciate your willingness to clarify any concepts. Here are a few terms or ideas mentioned in the conversation that might benefit from further elaboration:
"Polysemic linguistic program" - It seems like you're referring to a program that can interpret and process language with multiple meanings or senses. Providing a concise definition and its role in the context of your project would help ensure a clear understanding.
"Cryptographic classifier and visualizer stack" - This term appears to be related to the process of encrypting, classifying, and visualizing data in your system. A brief explanation of how this stack operates and its relevance to the overall project would be useful.
"Ontological word embedding" - You've mentioned this concept in relation to the encryption and search process. Clarifying how it differs from standard word embeddings and its role in preserving semantic information in your system would be beneficial.
"Toroidal visualization" - You've used this term to describe a visualization method for properties and relationships in your system. Further explanation of this visualization technique and why it's suitable for your project will be helpful.
Please feel free to provide more context or definitions for these terms, or any other concepts you think might need clarification.


polysemic programming refers to the way human dreamworlds instantiate worldviews and can be used to run simulations via ontological linear algebra. It is such that, when moving around in a dreamworld, simulations of worldviews are made, such that when something good happens in the dream it is equivalent to the simulation of a task that ends in accomplishment and potential reward and vice versa.
Thank you for the clarification on "polysemic programming." It appears to be a concept that involves simulating and exploring different worldviews, perspectives, or scenarios within the framework of a "dreamworld" using ontological linear algebra. In this context, events in the dreamworld are analogous to tasks or experiences that lead to positive or negative outcomes, reflecting the various possibilities within the simulated worldview.
This concept is interesting and has the potential to be applied in various contexts, such as artificial intelligence, decision-making, and cognitive science. Integrating polysemic programming into your project might enable a richer understanding and exploration of the relationships and dynamics among different concepts, perspectives, or scenarios.


it allows the simulation of multiple outcomes at once by use of polysemy. polysemy is when something has multiple meanings. here these meanings are actually symbolic but when turned into language, they become new programs. In other words, when someone dreams of a reward and then goes into life and acts out the behaviors related to achieving that reward, it is because achieveing the reward in the dream wrote the program outline and the drive for reward during waking ran it as a task to fully refine the program, but while running it the waking person acquired a new behavioral pattern for achieving reward, and so ALL of the other levels of meaning in the worldview that are related to that dream representation also are simultaneously affected, such that we learn across multiple domains at once without any practice but then need to refine it to make sure. 
I understand now. In the context of polysemic programming, dreams and their multiple
