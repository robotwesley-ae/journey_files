Hero and protagonist are different. Protagonists become heroes, sometimes. 

The Hero’s Journey is the journey a hero goes on or a would-be hero fails. 

It only becomes the hero’s journey when the audience observes the protagonist either become a hero or fail. 


This is how to instantiate drama or comedy master genres.
