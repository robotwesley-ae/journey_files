Some KOR agonists exhibit hallucinogenic or psychotomimetic properties, and the most well-known among them is Salvinorin A, which is the primary psychoactive compound in the plant Salvia divinorum. Salvinorin A is unique because it is a potent and highly selective KOR agonist, unlike many other hallucinogenic substances that primarily target the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor.

The exact mechanisms behind the hallucinogenic effects of KOR agonists are not completely understood. However, it is believed that their activation of KORs leads to a reduction in the release of dopamine in certain brain regions, such as the striatum and nucleus accumbens. This effect on dopamine is thought to contribute to the dysphoric, anxiogenic, and psychotomimetic properties associated with KOR agonists.

Further, KOR activation can modulate the release of other neurotransmitters, such as glutamate and serotonin, which could also contribute to the overall hallucinogenic experience. Additionally, KORs are distributed throughout various brain regions, including the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, and hypothalamus, which are all involved in mood, perception, and cognition.

More research is needed to better understand the exact neurobiological mechanisms underlying the hallucinogenic effects of KOR agonists and to determine whether other KOR agonists share these properties with Salvinorin A.

Oh ok. But what if the hallucinogenic effect of Salvinorin A had therapeutic properties at low doses? 

There is some evidence to suggest that hallucinogenic substances, including Salvinorin A, may have therapeutic potential at low doses. The concept of using low doses of psychedelics for therapeutic purposes is known as "microdosing."

While most research on the therapeutic potential of psychedelics has focused on substances like LSD, psilocybin, and MDMA, there is a growing interest in understanding the potential benefits of Salvinorin A and other KOR agonists. Some studies have suggested that Salvinorin A may have antidepressant, anti-addictive, and anti-inflammatory effects.

The therapeutic potential of Salvinorin A at low doses could be related to its unique mechanism of action on the kappa opioid receptors. It is possible that the modulation of the KOR system could provide relief from various mental health issues by altering the balance of neurotransmitters and neural activity in specific brain regions.

However, it is essential to note that research on the therapeutic potential of Salvinorin A and other KOR agonists is still in its early stages. More studies are needed to determine the safety, efficacy, and optimal dosing regimens for these substances in clinical settings.

Does KOR activation reset up and down regulation of other neurotransmitters? 

Kappa opioid receptor (KOR) activation has been shown to influence the regulation of other neurotransmitters in the brain. However, the relationship between KOR activation and the up- or down-regulation of neurotransmitters is complex and not fully understood.

KOR activation is known to modulate the release of several neurotransmitters, including dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, and glutamate. The effects of KOR activation on these neurotransmitter systems are often region-specific and depend on the brain area where the receptors are located.

For instance, KOR activation in certain brain regions, such as the nucleus accumbens and the ventral tegmental area, can lead to a decrease in dopamine release. This effect is thought to contribute to the dysphoric and anti-reward properties of KOR agonists. Similarly, KOR activation has been shown to influence serotonin and norepinephrine release in various brain regions, which can affect mood regulation and stress responses.
