Phases:

Testing and strategizing — every day
In addition to the normal tactical deployment schedule, new content is tested, so you have double raid duty 
In testing, the raid is using trial and error and high level clear communication to investigate and analyze the properties of the problems they are confronted with 
Testing is extremely expensive and requires higher levels of preparedness (like wider knowledge) than tactical deployment because the circumstances in which the problems arise are unknown 
Tactical deployment — 5 days/wk 
Everyone arrives fully prepared, having studied what needs to be done today and geared up outside of the raid until they are max item level, with full gems and enchants, potions, food, flasks, which need to be farmed during off time. 
There is a double check 
Everyone knows how to do their class job (know what department you work in)
Everyone knows how to play their spec (know your JD that you apply tactics from)
Everyone competes to be the most efficient and productive
There are meters
Reward queues are based on this
Everyone admits when they make a mistake in executing the tactic, and they are forgiven as long as their mistakes are confessed. Everyone has to be doing their best which means doing better and better each time
Small mistakes (dock you points in perception but nbd)
