Jeremy takes a deep breath and tries to solve the problem again. Zion watches him for a moment, then pulls out his phone and checks his notifications. A grin spreads across his face.
ZION: (Excitedly) Oh my gosh, Rolling Loud just announced their lineup! Travis Scott, Lil Baby, and Post Malone are all going to be there!
JEREMY: (Surprised) Rolling what now?
ZION: (Rapidly) Rolling Loud! It's this huge music festival with all the best hip-hop artists. Can we go, Dad? Please?
JEREMY: (Skeptical) I don't know, Zion. Festivals like that can be...a lot to handle.
ZION: (Pleading) Come on, Dad. I promise I'll be careful. And you can come with me! It'll be like a father-son adventure.
Jeremy hesitates, then looks at Zion and nods.
JEREMY: (Resigned) Alright, we'll go to Rolling Loud. But we're going to have some ground rules, young man.
ZION: (Grinning) Yes! You won't regret this, Dad.
Jeremy watches as Zion excitedly scrolls through the festival lineup on his phone, his own worries about the festival and their relationship brewing in his mind.
FADE OUT.

Zion shouldn't understand it either. He should just be distracted by his phone while Jeremy is struggling with the Zion's homework

Sure, here's a rewritten version with that adjustment:
FADE IN:
EXT. JEREMY'S HOUSE - DAY
We see Jeremy (47), a slightly uptight dad, sitting at the kitchen table with his teenage son, Zion (13). Jeremy is staring at a math textbook, scratching his head in confusion. Zion is slouched in his chair, staring at his phone.
JEREMY (under his breath) What in the world is this...?
ZION (distractedly) What's what?
JEREMY This algebra. I don't remember any of this stuff.
ZION (shrugs) I don't know it either.
JEREMY (worriedly) But you're learning it in school, right?
ZION (mumbles) Yeah, but it's hard.
JEREMY (trying to hide his concern) Well, I'll figure it out. I just need to...look up some things.
Jeremy starts typing on his laptop, trying to decipher the algebraic equations in front of him. Zion continues scrolling on his phone, uninterested.
Suddenly, Zion's phone buzzes with a notification.
ZION (excitedly) Oh man, Rolling Loud just announced their lineup!
JEREMY (distractedly) That's great, but let's focus on...
ZION (cutting him off) Dad, can we go? Please?
JEREMY (hesitant) I don't know, Zion. That's a festival filled with explicit music, drugs, and crowds of people who don't respect personal space.
ZION (disappointed) But everyone's going. And you said you'd take me to my first festival.
JEREMY (sighs) I did say that, didn't I?
ZION (nods eagerly) Yes, you did.
JEREMY (trying to put on a brave face) Okay, let's do it. But we'll have to set some ground rules.
ZION (grinning) Yes! Thank you, Dad.
Jeremy forces a smile, still worried about the festival but wanting to make his son happy.
FADE OUT.

Rewrite the following in the style of Jeremy Garelick (comedic, casual, witty, smart, tonally like The Hangover, The Break-Up, The Wedding Ringer):

Alright, let's do this thing. So we open on Jeremy (47), the protective dad, trying to help his son, Zion (13), with his math homework. Jeremy's sweating bullets as he tries to solve algebraic equations and word problems, but Zion's not making things any easier. The kid's glued to his phone, scrolling through the Rolling Loud festival lineup, clearly not interested in what his old man's trying to teach him.
Jeremy's struggling to keep up, throwing out guesses and hoping for the best, but he's not fooling anyone. Zion can see right through his dad's attempts to cover up his lack of math skills, and he's not impressed.
Suddenly, Zion's phone lights up with the announcement of the Rolling Loud festival. His eyes light up with excitement, and Jeremy's heart sinks. He knows what's coming next.
"Come on, Dad, we have to go to this!" Zion pleads, showing Jeremy the festival lineup. "It's gonna be epic!"
Jeremy's not thrilled about the idea of his young son at a festival filled with explicit music, drugs, and crowds of people who don't respect personal space. But Zion's determined, and Jeremy can't resist those puppy dog eyes.
And that's how our adventure begins, folks.
