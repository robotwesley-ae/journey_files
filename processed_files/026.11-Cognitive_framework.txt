The SKILLWAVE part seems to represent a cognitive process or journey of understanding. It involves understanding a problem ('PIO'sObstcl'), recontextualizing it ('ReCtx'), abstracting it ('abstrctn'), and then encapsulating it into a new metaphorical embodiment that becomes part of a larger metaphorical superdomain. This new metaphorical embodiment represents the problem's solution, produced by an 'emergent engine concept', which I presume is a cognitive or computational system that generates emergent solutions.
'Bldng Concatntns' further defines the process of problem-solving, involving analogy reasoning and a thorough analysis of beliefs and worldviews. This process also includes the measurement and admission of wasteland properties and self-faults, investigations of self and environment, analysis of sanctuary degree against a non-contradictory Sanctuary system, transformation of wasteland to sanctuary, and iteration. This could be understood as a learning process or cognitive development model aiming at self-improvement and self-understanding.
The 'InnrTchr' part appears to refer to an ethical or moral guide (inner teacher), incorporating principles of understanding, adaptive evolution, beneficial outcomes, balance restoration, holistic problem-solving, ethics compliance check, systems thinking, conflict resolution, stakeholder management, continuous learning, and more.
The final section with 'OMNICOMP&OMNISANC1.0' seems to outline a complex system of skill acquisition, skill chain optimization, representation of skill chains, adaptation, ethics, and communication, aiming at understanding, growth, and well-being.
Please note that this is a high-level interpretation. Without a more precise understanding of the context and specific meanings of your terminologies, there might be some misinterpretations. This system you're outlining seems highly complex and abstract, likely encompassing various domains of knowledge and cognitive processes.
exactly. so its a way for humans to learn how to program themselves via interacting with sanctuary aligned wisdom mavericks, and cause emergent systems to become engines building sanctuary system concatenations out of non-contradictory identitylessness caused by the fact that every PIO is also a hallucination and yet collapses the hallucinations

It seems like you're describing a sophisticated model of cognitive and personal development, with strong philosophical and ethical underpinnings. The terminology and framing is unique and might be specific to a certain context, but here is my interpretation:
The system you've outlined appears to promote personal growth through a process of self-programming. This process includes interaction with 'sanctuary aligned wisdom mavericks', presumably guides or mentors who embody principles of the Sanctuary system. They could be individuals or constructs that embody wisdom, openness, and growth-oriented values.
These interactions lead to the creation of emergent systems. Emergent systems are, by definition, systems where the whole has properties its parts do not have, and new properties emerge as a result of complex interactions. This emergence can be seen as an engine that powers the development of Sanctuary systems, or states of mind, values systems, or socio-cultural constructs that are harmonious, supportive, and growth-oriented.
The concept of 'non-contradictory identitylessness' might refer to a state of being or self-conception that is devoid of inherent contradictions and fixed identities. It suggests a flexibility and openness to growth and change, a willingness to release fixed or limiting self-conceptions, and an embracing of paradox and complexity.
The idea that 'every PIO is also a hallucination' suggests that these emergent constructs or ideas (PIOs) are understood to be constructs of the mind, or 'hallucinations'. They might be seen as flexible and malleable, rather than fixed or objectively real. This could reflect a philosophical perspective on the nature of knowledge and reality.
