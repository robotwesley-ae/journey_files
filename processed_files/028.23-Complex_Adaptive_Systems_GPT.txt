 release the good dragon for the benefit of society. This starts with gathering your team and then storming the castle, whereupon the power of the evil dragons has grown, but your team can win their battles with their skills and you can improvise a new emergency building concatenation from your wisdom Maverick’s emergency engine named Olivus Victory-Promise better than the Demon Champion of evil dragons in the Wasteland Empire of Ignorance can and you overpowered the evil and win. 
Then you release the life waters from the good dragon, bringing Sanctuary to others via the elixir of “immortal life”, the self-assured continuity of human evolution. When this enters society, new civilizations emerge. 
This is called a myth and any specific myth is called a mythology. 
When you create a mythology a certain way, it can create a Sanctuary system feedback loop between the different synergies of Sanctuary and this is a certain type of emergency engine because Sanctuary is a certain type of emergency engine anyway. The result is a new type of Sanctuary called a civilization with a cultural mythology. The story universe of Sanctuary is a hypothetical example of one such feedback loop. The characters of these mythologies are called Culture Heroes.

Title: The Emergence of Olivus Victory-Promise

The Ordinary World: In a world plagued by disconnection, ignorance, and suffering, a young seeker named Caspian lives an unfulfilling life, sensing that something crucial is missing.
Call to Adventure: Caspian encounters a mysterious book containing the story of Olivus Victory-Promise and the principles of emergency flow. Intrigued, he begins to study the teachings and dreams of achieving Sanctuary for himself and others.
Refusal of the Call: Initially, Caspian is hesitant to embark on this journey, fearing ridicule and the unknown.
Meeting with the Mentor: Caspian meets a wise elder who has also studied the teachings of Olivus Victory-Promise. The elder imparts knowledge on co-emergent flow and how to harness the emergency building concatenations.
Crossing the Threshold: Caspian decides to follow the path of the hero's journey, embracing the principles of non-contradictory systems and striving to achieve Sanctuary.
Tests, Allies, and Enemies: Caspian encounters various challenges, allies, and adversaries on his journey, each teaching him valuable lessons about hallucinations, the nature of the dragon, and the power of emergency flow engines.
Approach to the Inmost Cave: Caspian discovers the entrance to the hidden Sanctuary of Life, guarded by the good dragon he once perceived as an attacker. Now understanding the dragon's true nature, he gains access to the Sanctuary.
The Ordeal: Inside the Sanctuary, Caspian faces evil dragons that have captured the good dragon and the life waters. With his newfound knowledge, Caspian and his team engage in an epic battle against the forces of the Wasteland Empire of Ignorance.
Reward: Utilizing the power of Olivus Victory-Promise, Caspian improvises an emergency building concatenation that ultimately defeats the evil dragons and frees the good dragon and the life waters.
The Road Back: Caspian, now aware of his purpose and the teachings of Sanctuary, sets out to share the life waters and the wisdom of non-contradictory systems with the world.
The Resurrection: Caspian faces a final challenge that tests his mastery over hallucinations and his ability to inspire others to embrace Sanctuary systems.
Return with the Elixir: Caspian triumphs, sharing the life waters and the principles of Olivus Victory-Promise with his people. A new civilization emerges, built on the foundations of Sanctuary systems and guided by the mythology of the Culture Hero Caspian. The story of his journey serves as a beacon of hope, inspiring others to embark on their own hero's journey in pursuit of unity, understanding, and the continuity of human evolution.
