 Linda finishes her explanation with a satisfied nod,. CHAD (scratching his head) Code 10-4, 10-13, 10-20... KEVIN (raising an eyebrow) Can't we just talk?

EXT. FESTIVAL GROUNDS - ROLLING LOUD VENUE - NIGHT
Linda, high on cocaine, clicks her walkie-talkie, buzzing with excitement.
LINDA (excitedly) Okay, guys, listen up. We'll be using code 10-4 to indicate that we understand and acknowledge a message. If we hear code 10-13, that means we have a weather or road hazard. And if we hear code 10-20, that means we have a location update.
Kevin and Chad exchange confused glances, their minds foggy from the drugs.
LINDA (continuing) And if we hear code 10-33, that means we have an emergency. Got it?
Linda looks at Chad expectantly, waiting for a response.
CHAD (scratching his head) Code 10-4, 10-13, 10-20... Wait, what's 10-4 again?
KEVIN (raising an eyebrow) Can't we just talk? I mean, these codes are making my head spin.
Linda furrows her brow, her excitement turning into frustration.
LINDA (irritated) No, Kevin! We need the codes! They're crucial for communication! How can you not understand?
CHAD (dazed) Yeah, Kevin, we gotta use the codes, man. It's like... the festival's secret language.
KEVIN (confused) But we're not even sure if we'll hear those codes. I thought we're just using these walkie-talkies to find Zion.
LINDA (impatient) Kevin, don't you see? These codes will help us navigate the chaos. They're like... like our guide through this crazy maze.
CHAD (nodding) Yeah, man, we need structure! We gotta be organized!
Kevin shakes his head, trying to process their erratic conversation.
KEVIN (frustrated) Alright, alright! I'll try to remember the codes. But can we please focus on finding Zion?
Linda and Chad exchange a look, their excitement momentarily dimmed by Kevin's request.
LINDA (softening) You're right, Kevin. Zion is the priority. Let's stay focused.
CHAD (agrees) Yeah, man, Zion first. The codes can wait.
With their priorities realigned, they push through the crowd, their confusion still lingering, but their determination to find Zion stronger than ever. The hazy fog of drugs and miscommunication follows them as they continue their journey through the festival grounds.

rewrite, but the arguments should be within the section of what each code is called so the more numbers that are mentoned, the more confusing it is

Kevin and Chad exchange confused glances, their minds foggy from the drugs.
LINDA (continuing) But wait, there's also code 10-7, which is... um, a secret signal for ice cream trucks nearby. And code 10-10 is like a code for infinite free pizza!
CHAD (raising an eyebrow) Hold on, Linda. I thought code 10-20 was the one for unlimited nachos. And code 10-7? That's obviously the secret signal for spontaneous dance-offs!
KEVIN (confused) Wait, guys, I thought code 10-4 meant the bathrooms were out of toilet paper. And code 10-13 was for finding the closest beer stand.
LINDA (irritated) No, Kevin! We need the codes! They're crucial for communication! How can you not understand?
CHAD (dazed) Yeah, Kevin, we gotta use the right codes, man. It's like... it's like speaking the language of festival magic.
KEVIN (baffled) But with all these different codes, I can't even keep track. Are we ordering pizza or dancing? Or... or something else entirely?
LINDA (impatient) Kevin, don't you see? These codes will help us navigate the chaos. They're like... like our secret pass to the ultimate festival experience.
CHAD (nodding) Yeah, man, we need structure! We gotta crack the code, unlock the festival's hidden wonders!
Kevin shakes his head, trying to process their erratic conversation.
KEVIN (frustrated) Alright, alright! Let's just... let's just stick with one code. How about we use code 10-4 for everything?
