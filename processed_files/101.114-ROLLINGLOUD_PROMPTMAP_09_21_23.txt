The PLAYBUS is a pulsating, smoky haze. Marijuana mist swirls (the bus has been rigged to be a giant hotbox). KEVIN, SHENSEEA, and KEESHALOO push through the crowd towards PLAYBOI CARTI, engrossed in his own track.
KEVIN (nervously) Uh, hello, Mr. Carti. My name's Kevin. I'm... a big fan of yours.
Carti raises an eyebrow, his interest piqued but skeptical.
PLAYBOI CARTI Oh, really? So, what's your favorite track of mine?
KEVIN (immediately) Sky. It's Sky.
Carti looks surprised, a grin spreading across his face.
PLAYBOI CARTI (leans back, crossing arms) Alright then, let's hear it.
KEVIN You want to hear it? Like, play it on an iPhone?
PLAYBOI CARTI I want you to sing your favorite song if you’re such a big fan.
Heart pounding, Kevin takes a deep breath and starts the first verse of "Sky", his voice shaky yet sincere.
KEVIN (singing, unsteady) I told my boy go on, like ten flats on the fifty-yard...Yeah, yeah, off the fifty, yeah, yeah...
A chorus of laughter erupts, but Kevin pushes through, refusing to back down.
PLAYBOI CARTI (laughs) Nah, man. You ain't a fan.
Realizing Carti's disbelief, Kevin admits the truth, his words rushing out in a desperate confession.
KEVIN (determined) You're right. I'm not a fan, not really. I don’t actually love your music, but I love my son and he loves your music. So I brought him to Rolling Loud thinking we’d watch you perform tonight. I secretly learned all the words to Sky to surprise him, but now I can't find him. Someone said he might have come looking for you, for a photo...
The laughter fades. Carti's amusement subsides.
PLAYBOI CARTI What's your son look like?
KEVIN Let me show you...
Kevin pulls out his phone to find a photo of Zion, but accidentally opens a risqué text from earlier.
PLAYBOI CARTI (laughs) Damn, Kev.
Flustered, Kevin quickly scrolls past the photo.
KEVIN (mumbling) That's, um, not...
Playboi Carti nods in understanding.
PLAYBOI CARTI I get it.
Finally, he finds a picture of Zion and shows it to Carti.
INSERT SHOT - A PHOTO OF KEVIN AND A YOUNGER ZION.
KEVIN That's Zion...
Carti shakes his head.
PLAYBOI CARTI No Zion here, man.
Kevin's heart sinks. His plan has failed. His phone rings - the caller ID shows "MELANIE - WIFE".
KEVIN (muttering) Can't do this now, Mel...
He moves to decline the call.
PLAYBOI CARTI Always answer the wife, Kev.
Resigned, Kevin sighs and answers the call.
KEVIN (low, kind of embarrassed) Hey, honey.
MELANIE Hey, how’s everything going?
KEVIN Good! We're just here watching a movie. Zi is pretty knackered, I think he dozed off. The movie is so loud, it woke me up. How’s the party?
CARTI (whispering) Tell her you love her hot ass.
KEVIN (waving Carti off) What’s up?
MELANIE Sorry to wake you. I miss you guys is all. This birthday dinner was kind of a drag, everybody just talked about their problems the whole time.
KEVIN I love you hot ass.
MELANIE What?
KEVIN I said, I wish you were here.
MELANIE Me too. I’m gonna leave this thing now I think. Good night.
KEVIN Night.
Kevin's hopes are shattered, his heart heavy.
Rewrite the following but add in that they are frantically trying to turn all the lights on in the cabin, eat some of the groceries, make the place look like they've been their all night: EXT. LAKE HOUSE - NIGHT They skid into the driveway just as Melanie's car turns the corner onto their street. Kevin and Zion jump out of the car and sprint towards the house, grabbing the delivered groceries from the front door. INT. MELANIE’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER Melanie parks and gets out... INT. LAKE HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT In a flurry, they seat themselves at the kitchen table, spreading out textbooks and homework. The sheets stick to Kevin’s arm from all the sweat. He tears them off. Just as they settle in, out of breath, the front door opens. KEVIN So X is always the width, Zion. MELANIE (O.S.) Hello? Kevin and Zion share a glance. Then, feigning innocence, they turn towards the sound of Melanie's voice. KEVIN Hey, honey. You’re back.
