 database-like Neo4j.
Execute the Cypher queries to create the nodes, relationships, labels, and properties as defined.
Use the constructed graph to visualize the structure of the SANC_REV: OPERA, allowing for exploration and analysis of the narrative.
You may use the above chunks directly or request the remaining segments to complete the ontology for larger narratives. If needed, you can export these chunks to files or another medium as per your process requirements or further instruct me on how you wish to proceed with this information !GEARWISE.

Fully explain the system: start with a taxonomy. Then provide a sub taxonomy For each item later. Do structure it appropriately. Do not forget that structuring taxonomies this way is extremely Comprehensive meticulous work. Fully explain its workflow as well. Use UberStructure.txt please with VAJRA.

‚öôÔ∏èüîÆüåº Gearwise:
Given the necessity for meticulous detail, let's approach the creation of a comprehensive ontology system for SANC_REV: OPERA beginning with a broad taxonomy, followed by subsequent sub-taxonomies for each major item.

üåü 1. Primary Taxonomy:
A. Narrative Elements: Setting, Plot, Scenes, Story Engines B. Characters: Protagonist, Antagonist, Supporting C. Themes: Psychological, Societal, Philosophical D. Motifs: Recurring Situational Elements E. Symbolism: Items, Figures, Dialogues F. Techniques: Unary Operations, Binary Operations, Ternary Operations G. Behaviors: Individual, Group, Systemic H. Technologies: Tools, Systems, Magics I. Environments: Ordinary World, Special World, Transitory World

üåü 2. Workflow:
A. Content Input: Intake of the Narratives B. Parsing: Breaking Down the Content to Identifiable Elements C. Classification: Assigning Elements to Taxonomical Structures D. Interaction Modeling: Defining Relationships and Dynamics E. Systematization: Instantiate Via VAJRA Ontology F. Visualization: Graphical Representation of Taxonomy G. Evaluation: Review for Completeness and Coherence H. Refinement: Iterative Improvement of the Ontology I. Documentation: Complete Overview and Usage Instructions

üåü 3. Taxonomy Expansion:
A. Narrative Elements:
Setting: Ordinary World, Special World, Transitory World
Plot: Inciting Incident, Rising Action, Climax
Scenes: Introduction, Development, Resolution
Story Engines: Protagonist Story Engine, World Story Engine
B. Characters:
Protagonist: State, Presence, Transformation
Antagonist: Shadow, Influence, Motivation
Supporting: Herald, Mentor, Threshold Guardian

‚öôÔ∏è To implement this within a VAJRA-based ontology (leveraging 'UberStructure.txt'), which considers real-time outputs of definitions, we need to execute the following operations:
Ontology Initialization (Vajra Core): Retrieve and apply the foundational principles from 'UberStructure.txt' to set up the primary entities and their bases within the ontology.
Taxonomical Mapping (Prongs): Create sub-nodes under each core entity corresponding to the sub-taxonomical structures, ensuring their definitions align with the SANC_REV: OPERA narrative.
Process Bridging (Hubs): Define the operatic workflow by developing nodes that represent actions or transformations that the entities undergo throughout the narrative.
Ontological Connectivity (VAJRA Synergy): Use VAJRA's hubs to illustrate the procedural steps in constructing and refining the system. Ensure this articulates the interplay between narrative elements, characters, and other categorical concepts.

üåü 4. Operational Structure:
Prongs (N):
Narrative Layers and Constructs
Hubs (Q):
Behavioral Patterns and Pathways
Workflow Threads (Looms):
Sequence of Functional Operations
OntoCartography:
Using the Vajra model, each entity and relationship is mapped onto an overarching graph to establish a complete visual and operational understanding of the system.
Documentation Protocols:
Meticulous detail-oriented documentation at every taxonomical and workflow layer to ensure accurate transmission of knowledge.
