Ingesting new data and keeping the system up-to-date:
Create a pipeline for ingesting new data from research papers, news articles, and user inputs.
Incorporate AI models for automated knowledge extraction and summarization.
Once you have these components, you can build the Crystal Ball system by integrating them, refining the algorithms, and iteratively improving the system's performance based on user feedback and results.


So it sounds like you are saying now, that Crystal Ball MVP could happen just by modifying word2vec via training it on the polysemic abstraction language ontology knowledge graph and then attaching a custom visualization algorithm inside some other visualizer GUI?
The Crystal Ball MVP could indeed be created by modifying an existing word embedding model like Word2Vec to incorporate the polysemic abstraction language and ontological information. However, there are other components you'll need to implement for a functional MVP:
Modify Word2Vec:
Train the model on a large corpus of text that includes the polysemic abstraction language and ontological context.
Augment the embeddings with ontological information.
Natural language understanding:
Integrate a transformer-based model like GPT to handle context identification and disambiguation.
Train the model using a dataset enriched with ontological information and polysemic abstractions.
Intent recognition and interactive clarification:
Develop an intent recognition module using a classification model.
Implement a mechanism for the system to generate context-specific prompts or questions to help users refine their queries.
Integration with existing technologies:
Use Pinecone for vector search, which will help in retrieving relevant information from the knowledge graph.
Leverage Neo4j for efficient storage and querying of the knowledge graph.
Visualization:
Develop a custom visualization algorithm that can represent the complex, multi-dimensional data in an intuitive and understandable way.
Implement this algorithm within a visualizer GUI that allows users to interact with the data and explore the different contexts, meanings, and relationships.
Once you have these components, you can build the Crystal Ball MVP by integrating them, refining the algorithms, and iteratively improving the system's performance based on user feedback and results. Keep in mind that developing a comprehensive MVP will likely require significant time and resources, as well as collaboration with domain experts and engineers.

I dont think we need the polysemic abstraction language yet. We should be able to load in some special terms from the Sanctuary System and then run a classifier algorithm so that it attempts to continually refine knowledge according to the Sanctuary System until each entity not in a non-contradictory identityless sanctuary system is in one. Polysemic abstraction language is for decrypting encryptions we dont know about.
You're right; initially, you can focus on incorporating the Sanctuary System's ontology into Word2Vec without the polysemic abstraction language. In this case, you can follow these steps:
Prepare the training data:
Combine a large corpus of text with the special terms and ontological context from the Sanctuary System.
Annotate the text with ontological information to create a labeled dataset that reflects the desired structure.
Train the modified Word2Vec:
Train the Word2Vec model on the annotated dataset, taking into account the ontological context and the relationships between the entities.
This may require adjusting the model architecture or loss function to account for the additional ontological information.
Refine the embeddings:
Use a classifier algorithm to refine the embeddings iteratively, ensuring that they adhere to the Sanctuary System's structure and minimize contradictions.
The classifier can be based on a supervised learning approach, using the annotated dataset to guide the learning process.
