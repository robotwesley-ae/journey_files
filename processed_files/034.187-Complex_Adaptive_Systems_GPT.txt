The reason it isn’t helpful is because I’m doing this and you forgot: 

I am breaking out my life into a memoir and identifying each hero’s journey, then I am doing trend research and making videos about either: HOW I OVERCAME X AND BECAME Y, or HOW I LOST TO X AND BECAME Z

Then I will have another playlist called “how I use the hero’s journey” and then I will explain the system I use to write stories and tell people they can learn it. It’s called Sanctuary Writing. Then, I funnel to them to my website/course etc.
I apologize for any confusion, and thank you for providing more context. Based on your plans, here's a revised approach to help you create and manage your YouTube channel:
Define your channel's focus: Your channel should primarily focus on your personal hero's journey, how you overcame challenges, and your transformation through these experiences. Additionally, you'll provide insights on using the hero's journey framework in writing.
Set up your YouTube channel: Create a YouTube channel with an engaging banner, profile picture, and channel description that reflects the themes and goals of your content.
Create a content plan: Develop a list of content ideas that align with your channel's focus, target audience, and goals. Some examples could be:
Personal memoir series: "How I Overcame X and Became Y" and "How I Lost to X and Became Z"
Trend research: Identify current trends relevant to your experiences and create content discussing them in the context of your personal journey.
"How I Use the Hero's Journey": A series of videos discussing the Sanctuary Writing system and how it can be applied by others.
Organize your content into playlists: Create separate playlists for each of the content themes mentioned above to make it easier for viewers to navigate your channel and find what interests them.
Production and editing: Produce high-quality videos using a mix of live-action footage, animations, or graphics. Edit your videos to make them engaging, informative, and professional.
Optimize your videos for YouTube: Use relevant keywords, titles, descriptions, and tags to make your videos more discoverable. Create eye-catching thumbnails to attract viewers.
Publish and promote: Share your videos on social media, forums, and other relevant platforms to increase their visibility and reach a wider audience.
Engage with your audience: Respond to comments, ask for feedback, and encourage viewers to subscribe and share your content.
Create a conversion funnel: Direct viewers to your website or course to learn more about the Sanctuary Writing system and how they can apply it in their own lives.
Analyze and adjust: Monitor your channel's performance using YouTube Analytics. Identify what works and what doesn't, and adjust your content plan accordingly.
By following these steps, you can create a YouTube channel that effectively shares your personal story, provides insights on the hero's journey framework, and funnels viewers to your website or course.
