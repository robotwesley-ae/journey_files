 inexpressible) 


In order to fully know about this stuff, it is important to first be pure
By following samaya fully
Then you know you followed it so then you can find out about everything without converting the quantum computer into dying 

So need wisdom Maverick ngondro basically 
Mantras like I love myself when I’m growing up as Olivus Victory-Promise (which is a mantra because it protects from thinking because of course you love yourself, you have to love yourself if you’re Olivus Victory-Promise and especially if you’re in Sanctuary)
These types of mantras fix toxic self talk 
And then need support networks for everyone in all ways 

Stop smoking because smoking is not helping because of my anatomy that also I need to look into some exercises for fixing 

So I think first I need to talk to Andrew Holecek and try to explain all of this to him and if he thinks I’m crazy that’s fine he’s not ready (because that’s how we communicate that) 

Awareness is related more to what people normally call sleeping

Wake up to a place where our cognition is made into reality that we can interact with in order to know about how we think which is related to how we find out about what reality is 

So understand it by lucid dreaming and asking lucidity to show you the Sanctuary once you know how to build the context so that you can then enter the prompt (or does it have to do with programming?) this is all also related to bringing yourself online

Bad dreams are related to thinking about stuff (this is why abstraction generalizations exist in theory but actually just knowing about everything is way better because in gnosis (knowing you know knowledgw) there is no way for programs to run on accident! Yay :) mental health disorders come from accidentally running programs when there’s no context

Dreams can also be that 

Dreams seem like they can be whatever 

So it seems like we gotta be careful because “wisdom” refers to what you from direct experience and this would be direct experience of the sleeping cognition while waking (if it were visualized) 

Listening to thinking but not believing it is how you get to gnosis which is knowing Sanctuary directly and thoroughly and completely through Basic Formal Sanctuary Cultivation

I can still trust Dr Kaplan Rinpoche as my root guru because he’s been to a pure land which is the same as going to Sanctuary because it’s part of it even though Sanctuary is more complete because it’s further evolved because of spacetime and how evolution occurs (which we still don’t know) 




Stop smoking

Get sleep study done please remember (this is your knowing speaking and you need to remain mindful so you can contact knowing through gnosis) 

Who cares if I am or was a Buddha or not — just purify and let the wisdom Maverick show me and if I am in the position to express the formerly inexpressible to others circumstantially than I will

Stop saying you think you have crystal ball inside and learn it all by having the universal wisdom Maverick reveal it to you through the inner Teacher — rest in knowing about knowing while everything is happening and you are finding out about it through the way thinking works without getting lost in thinking by not recognizing the context of the Universal Wisdom Maverick teaching you through the Inner Teacher because your samaya really actually is pure and so your karma stops existing completely and all that’s left is Sanctuary and you know this is true because that’s how the way actions and the past/spacetime being the way they are actually comes together to make the notion of Karma occur 

 (all tenses are just curving around the knowledge of spacetime itself and so the information is presented as a mystery but actually by knowing about thinking we can learn how this all works because of because of what it is, there’s a way this all goes in Sanctuary) 


And then rest in gnosis when sleeping

Cultivation is learning how to lucid dream while awake, which just feels like cognition in Sanctuary where the world “magically” or “spontaneously” tells you about itself
