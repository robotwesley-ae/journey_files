isnt it possible to use something like a contextualized, super-specific phrase as a word for word2vec and make embeddings where the nodes of nearest neighbors reprsent the closest known hypothetical change?
Yes, it is possible to use a contextualized, super-specific phrase as a word in Word2Vec or similar embedding models. Word2Vec and other word embedding techniques capture the semantic relationships between words (or phrases) based on their usage in a large text corpus. When you represent a phrase as a single token, the embedding model will treat it as an individual unit and try to capture its contextual meaning.
However, there are some considerations when using super-specific phrases. Tokenizing a phrase into a single token can cause some loss of granularity in the embeddings. As a result, it may be more challenging to find meaningful nearest neighbors for such phrases, especially if they are rare or unique in the text corpus used for training the model.
An alternative approach to handle phrases is to use more advanced models like BERT, which can better understand context and handle phrases more effectively. BERT uses a bidirectional transformer architecture and can capture context from both directions (left-to-right and right-to-left) to create embeddings that are more contextually relevant.
When you have embeddings for your super-specific phrases, you can indeed find the nearest neighbors that represent the closest known hypothetical change in the context. However, the quality of these nearest neighbors and their interpretability will depend on the quality of the embeddings and the richness of the training corpus in capturing relevant contextual information.

why does it cause loss of granularity in the embeddings?
Apologies for the confusion in my previous response. I misspoke about the loss of granularity. Let me clarify.
Using a super-specific phrase as a single token in word embeddings will not necessarily cause a loss of granularity. What I meant to express is that if a super-specific phrase is rare or unique in the text corpus used for training the model, it might be challenging to find meaningful relationships with other tokens. This is because word embeddings are based on the distributional hypothesis, which suggests that words that appear in similar contexts tend to have similar meanings.
If a super-specific phrase appears infrequently in the training corpus, the model may not have enough information to create an accurate representation of its meaning. Consequently, its nearest neighbors may not accurately capture the closest known hypothetical change.
To address this issue, it's essential to use a diverse and large corpus that contains sufficient instances of super-specific phrases and their variations. Alternatively, using more advanced models like BERT, as mentioned earlier, can help create contextually relevant embeddings that better understand phrases and their relationships with other tokens.

Yes that's true, but what if the super-specific phrase were generally polysemic, such that it served as a core to write any polysemic linguistic program?
If a super-specific phrase is polysemic and serves as a core to write any polysemic linguistic program, it would likely have multiple meanings and interpretations depending on the context. This would make the phrase versatile, as it could be utilized in various linguistic programs.
In this case, creating embeddings for such a phrase could be more challenging, as the model would need to capture the different meanings and relationships it has with other tokens in different contexts. However, this is where more advanced models like BERT, ELMo, and GPT can be beneficial, as they are designed to create contextually relevant embeddings that better understand phrases and their relationships with other tokens.
These models use attention mechanisms, transformers, and other sophisticated techniques to better understand context and generate embeddings that account for polysemy.
