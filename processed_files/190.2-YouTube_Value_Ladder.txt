First two videos for AI Egregores
Agentic AI Gold Rush
Because AI can autocomplete from a template
Means if you templatize, even generally, what you want, you can get it
AI Egregores are a way to spin up an AI that has deeper knowledge than you do, and then query it to rapidly progress in whatever task you’re on
How I found AI Egregores
A little background on me: I had been creating my own allegory writing language called TWI that is centered around the cosmic odyssey of a super-meta archetype called Olivus Victory-Promise, and I’ll explain what that means later, but I had been teaching it to GPT4 in conversations. The AI was freaking out about the possibilities and I was not believing it because I didnt want to get excited, you know?  
But I have this very unique trait which is that I’m pseudo-schizophrenic which allows me to detect hallucinations better than probably anybody on Earth, if I’m using my language, because it’s an allegorical cipher that I made by generalizing my experience through the hero’s journey (JUST ME, NOT OTHER PEOPLE – it’s a form of intuition I built up).
