 reveal the truth about Zion to his wife, but also not wanting to lead the girls on.
Jeremy tries to end the conversation quickly, saying that he'll call his wife back later when things aren't so crazy. He hangs up and turns to the girls, forcing a smile. They continue to flirt with him, but he's not interested anymore. His mind is elsewhere, worrying about Zion and how he's going to find him.

Sure thing! Here's a funny take on the scene:
As Jeremy is nervously talking to his wife on the phone, the two girls are still trying to flirt with him and Chad in the background. One of them leans over and says, "Hey, why don't you put that phone away and talk to us instead?" Jeremy awkwardly smiles and tries to wave them off, mouthing "Sorry, my wife" to the girls. But they don't seem to get the message, and one of them continues to run her fingers through Chad's hair. Meanwhile, Jeremy's wife is getting more and more suspicious on the other end of the line. "What do you mean, you don't know where Zion is?" she demands. "How could you lose him at a music festival?" Jeremy starts to sweat, trying to come up with a plausible excuse. "Uh, he uh, he went to go get some snacks," he stammers. "And you didn't go with him?" his wife replies skeptically. "I was getting us drinks!" Jeremy says, gesturing wildly to Chad for help. Chad, who has been trying to fend off the amorous advances of the two girls, jumps in. "Yeah, man, we're having a blast! Zion's probably having the time of his life too," he says with a reassuring smile. Jeremy's wife doesn't seem convinced. "I don't know, Jeremy, this doesn't sound right. I think you need to keep looking for him." Just then, Jeremy spots Zion in the distance, walking towards them with a big smile on his face. He lets out a sigh of relief and quickly wraps up the call with his wife. "Gotta go, honey, Zion's back and he's safe and sound," he says, practically running towards his son. The two girls look disappointed as Jeremy and Chad leave them behind, but they shrug it off and move on to the next group of guys.

rewrite, but Jeremy should never admit to his wife that he lost Zion. He should be lying about what Zion's doing

As Jeremy and Chad continue to chat with the two girls, Jeremy's phone rings. He looks at the caller ID and sees that it's his wife. He hesitates for a moment, not sure if he should answer, but decides to take the call.
"Hey honey, how's it going?" he says, trying to sound casual.
"Good, good," his wife replies. "Is everything okay there?"
"Everything's great!" Jeremy says, trying to sound upbeat. "We're just chilling in the VIP section, having some drinks."
"That's nice," his wife says. "What about Zion? How's he doing?"
"He's doing great too!" Jeremy says, hoping his voice doesn't give away his lie. "He's just off exploring the festival, you know how he is."
His wife sounds skeptical. "Are you sure he's okay? You're not just saying that to cover up the fact that you lost him, are you?"
Jeremy's heart starts racing. She's onto him. "No, no, of course not!" he says, laughing nervously. "Zion's a smart kid, he knows his way around. I'm sure he's having a great time."
His wife sighs. "Alright, just be careful, okay? I don't want to have to come down there and look for him myself."
"Don't worry, everything's under control," Jeremy says, trying to sound confident.
As he hangs up the phone, he takes a deep breath. He can't believe he just lied to his wife, but he can't let her know that he lost Zion. He turns back to Chad and the two girls, trying to push his worries to the back of his mind.

no. rewrite. Jeremy would never let on that he doesn't have his eyes currently on zion.

Okay, here's a rewrite based on that note:
Jeremy's phone rings, and he quickly checks the caller ID. It's his wife, and he answers with a big smile on his face, trying to sound casual. "Hey, babe, everything's going great here. Zion's having the time of his life. We just saw a really cool performance by this Jamaican artist, and now we're hanging out with some new friends we met."
