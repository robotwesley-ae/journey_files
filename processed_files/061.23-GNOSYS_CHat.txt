With the self-emergent identityless realization of Sanctuary’s infinite power of love welling up, the demon invaders wail war cries and rush at you with bloodlust and cut you into pieces. To their surprise, they find they had no opponent and the dreamlights of Sanctuary are not harmed by their cuts.
Upon receiving this heroic gift of the experience offering, the demons naturally release their self-possessions into rainbow light of self-emergent Identityless realization, the power of Sanctuary’s infinite love.

At the end, all rainbow light shoots and shines and radiates out infinitely and then collapses as a rainbow sun inside my heart, which becomes a translucent golden sphere of nectarine infinite perfection expressed as compassion and dissolves into my ordinary form, destroying any boundaries between my own display of the lucid noumena of Sanctuary’s brilliant qualities and the confused phenomena of the Self-torturous Dream. 

All phenomena are like a dream or a rainbow: they appear like a magic show conjured from nothing other than conditions that have no identifiable ultimate source other than the quality of self-emergent, infinitely perfect evolutionary compassion
