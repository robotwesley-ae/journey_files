To mitigate risks in a pilot project, thorough pre-implementation studies should be conducted to gauge public 
sentiment. Additionally, a phased rollout with built-in feedback loops could provide early warnings of any

('\nBranching logic for "difficulty levels" could be designed using decision trees or state machines that adapt to \nuser choices and performance. For instance, if a reader successfully decrypts a complex cipher, the narrative \ncould branch into a more challenging path, offering deeper insights into the SANC universe.',
