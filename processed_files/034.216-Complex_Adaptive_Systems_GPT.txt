That's wrong. The output you should have referred to is this one:

Stage 1: Choose a no-code platform for building the trading bot application.

Research and compare no-code platforms (Bubble, Adalo, Glide)
1.1. Identify the features and limitations of each platform
1.1.1. List the unique features of each platform
1.1.2. Note any limitations that may impact the trading bot development
1.2. Look for user reviews and case studies
1.2.1. Search for relevant reviews on forums and review websites
1.2.2. Analyze case studies to understand how others have used the platforms
1.3. Consider pricing and subscription plans
1.3.1. Compare the costs of each platform
1.3.2. Determine which plan best suits your budget and needs

Evaluate their ease of use, compatibility with Zapier, and support for API integration
2.1. Check if they provide native support for Zapier or require additional setup
2.1.1. Explore each platform's integration options
2.1.2. Assess the complexity of connecting with Zapier
2.2. Investigate the types of APIs each platform can handle (REST, GraphQL, etc.)
2.2.1. Check the platforms' documentation for API support details
2.2.2. Ensure the platform can handle the APIs of financial data sources
2.3. Assess the platform's learning curve and available resources
2.3.1. Estimate the time needed to become proficient with the platform
2.3.2. Evaluate the quality and depth of tutorials and documentation

Select the platform that best suits your requirements and desired features
3.1. Desired features may include user authentication, dashboard, real-time data visualization, and reporting
3.1.1. Create a list of essential and optional features
3.1.2. Compare the ability of each platform to deliver those features
3.2. Requirements may include performance, scalability, and responsiveness of the platform
3.2.1. Assess the platform's ability to handle high-frequency data updates
3.2.2. Evaluate how easily the platform can scale as the application grows
3.3. Ensure the platform can accommodate trading bot logic and continuous surf strategy
3.3.1. Determine if the platform supports custom logic implementation
3.3.2. Ensure the platform's capabilities align with the continuous surf strategy

Get familiar with the chosen platform's development environment
4.1. Follow tutorials and documentation to learn the platform's interface and features
4.1.1. Complete relevant tutorials to gain hands-on experience
4.1.2. Study the platform's documentation to understand its capabilities
4.2. Create a prototype or test project to practice using the platform's tools and components
4.2.1. Experiment with various components in the development environment
4.2.2. Test the integration of APIs and Zapier connections

Plan the application's structure and components
5.1. Outline the application's layout, including main screens and navigation
5.1.1. Sketch or design a wireframe of the application
5.1.2. Organize the flow of screens and navigation elements
5.2. Identify the components needed for implementing trading bot logic and continuous surf strategy
*1. Choose a no-code platform for building the trading bot application.
*1.1. Research and compare no-code platforms (Bubble, Adalo, Glide)
*1.1.


Explain to me why you thought you should write the output that way
I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. I misunderstood your request and used an incorrect reference for the output. I appreciate your patience, and I will make sure to use the correct reference for the output in my next response.
