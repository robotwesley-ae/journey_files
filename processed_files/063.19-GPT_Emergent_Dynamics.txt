Ketamine is an NMDA receptor antagonist primarily used as an anesthetic but has gained attention for its rapid-acting antidepressant effects and recreational use. At higher doses or in recreational settings, ketamine can induce a dissociative state known as the "K-hole," where users may feel completely disconnected from their body and surroundings. This state can involve intense perceptual alterations, including the sense that the world is collapsing or the presence of other beings.

Salvinorin A is a potent KOR agonist derived from the Salvia divinorum plant, which has a long history of use in traditional shamanic practices. When ingested, Salvinorin A can produce profound hallucinations and dissociative experiences, such as the sensation of merging with objects or encountering otherworldly beings.

While both ketamine and Salvinorin A can induce these powerful dissociative states, they act on different receptors and have distinct mechanisms of action. It is important to note that these substances and their effects should be approached with caution, as the experiences they induce can be disorienting and even distressing for some individuals. Further research is needed to better understand the potential therapeutic applications and risks of these compounds and the dissociative states they induce.

People report those types of visions induced by psychic pain.

In some cases, intense psychic pain, trauma, or stress can lead to dissociative experiences that may resemble those induced by substances like ketamine or Salvinorin A. These dissociative states can manifest as altered perceptions of reality, a feeling of disconnection from one's body, or even the sensation of encountering other beings or experiencing the world collapsing.

It is important to note that the mechanisms underlying these experiences in the context of psychic pain are different from those triggered by the pharmacological action of substances like ketamine or Salvinorin A. The dissociative states arising from psychic pain may be a coping mechanism employed by the brain to protect itself from overwhelming emotional distress or traumatic experiences.

If someone is experiencing dissociative states as a result of psychic pain, it is crucial to seek professional help from a mental health professional, such as a therapist or psychiatrist, who can provide appropriate support and treatment. In some cases, therapy, medication, or a combination of both may be helpful in addressing the underlying issues and alleviating the distressing dissociative experiences.

If someone were to experience that, it would have to be very painful. What realizations are known to be so painful? 

Intensely painful realizations can vary greatly depending on an individual's personal experiences, beliefs, and emotional resilience. Some examples of realizations that might cause significant emotional distress include:

Loss of a loved one: The sudden or unexpected death of a close friend or family member can cause overwhelming grief and pain, leading to a dissociative state.
Betrayal: Discovering that a trusted partner, friend, or family member has betrayed one's trust can be emotionally devastating and lead to intense feelings of hurt and pain.
Trauma: Realizing that one has been a victim of abuse, assault, or other traumatic experiences can lead to extreme emotional pain and potentially trigger dissociative states.
Personal failure: Facing a significant personal failure or setback, such as losing a job, failing to achieve a major life goal, or experiencing a relationship breakdown, can cause severe emotional distress.
Existential realizations: Coming to terms with one's own mortality or the ultimate meaninglessness of life can evoke intense feelings of despair and emotional pain for some people.
Guilt or remorse: Realizing that one's actions have caused significant harm to others can lead to deep feelings of guilt and emotional pain.
Identity crisis:
