Kevin tries to reason with them, insisting that he just wants to find his son. But as the guards move to cuff him, Kevin's panic kicks in. In a desperate move, he pushes one of them aside and manages to slip away, running back into the festival crowd.
His heart races as he realizes he's now a wanted man, but his primary focus remains on finding his son. He dodges through the crowd, his eyes scanning the faces of festival-goers as he searches for Zion. The weight of his mistakes and the looming threat of security and child protective services press down on him, but he knows he can't give up until he finds his son.

Rewrite the following: "Kevin decides to wait in line at a nearby food truck to grab food for them both while Zion takes care of his business." But introduce CHAD here. Chad (a character that can be played by Will Ferrell) is on line with Kevin and recognizes Kevin from High School. They bond over the old days. Chad is a little eccentric and clearly is more enamored with Kevin than Kevin is with Chad. Kevin is friendly, but standoffish. Chad gives all sorts of recommendations for the vegan food truck order. Then he even offers to pay, despite Kevin's not wanting him to pay. Chad insists. Kevin is actually okay with it because the food costs a ton of money.

As Kevin scans the area, looking for a way to locate Zion, he spots a food truck nearby and decides to grab some food for them both. As he joins the line, he suddenly hears a familiar voice behind him.
"Kevin? Is that you, man?"
He turns to see Chad, a former classmate from high school. Chad looks as if he hasn't aged a day, with his unkempt hair and loud Hawaiian shirt.
"Chad, wow! How are you?" Kevin replies, surprised but friendly.
Chad begins to reminisce about the old days, but Kevin is more focused on the task at hand. As they wait in line, Chad starts to recommend vegan options from the food truck, insisting that he pays for their meal.
Despite Kevin's protests, Chad won't take no for an answer. As they sit down to eat, Chad continues to talk about the past, but Kevin can't shake the feeling that Chad is a little too enthusiastic about their reunion.
Nonetheless, Kevin appreciates the help and the food, which costs a fortune at the festival.

Great. Now rewrite the following with more detail and add that they are not sitting to eat, but waiting for Zion to return: As Kevin scans the area, looking for a way to locate Zion, he spots a food truck nearby and decides to grab some food for them both.

As they eat, Kevin glances at his phone, hoping for a message from Zion. Chad notices his unease and tries to make conversation to distract him.
"So, what brings you to Rolling Loud?" Chad asks, taking a big bite of his vegan burger.
"I'm here with my son," Kevin replies, gesturing around the festival grounds. "It's our first time at a music festival together."
Chad's eyes light up. "That's awesome, man. You're such a cool dad. I bet your son thinks you're the coolest guy ever."
Kevin chuckles, feeling a bit embarrassed. "I don't know about that. But I'm trying my best."
Just then, Kevin's phone buzzes with a notification. He eagerly checks it, hoping for good news, but it's just a spam message.
"Damn," he mutters, putting the phone away. "I hope Zion's okay."
