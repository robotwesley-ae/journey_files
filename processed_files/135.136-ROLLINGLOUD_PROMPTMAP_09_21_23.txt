Eagerly, they rush to the hose, turning it on. The water pressure is painfully powerful, causing Kevin to howl in agony and Chad and Linda to struggle to control the unruly hose.
They contort and twist their bodies in comical ways, desperately trying to wash off the filth. Linda bends over awkwardly, Chad crab-walks, and Kevin flails around like a fish out of water. The struggle continues for what feels like an eternity, bruises forming where the forceful water hits them.
Finally, they manage to wash off the filth, left drenched and sore but relieved to be clean. They can't help but laugh at the absurdity of the situation.
Suddenly, a group of volunteer firefighters arrives, demanding to know what they're doing.
FIREFIGHTER #1 (angry) What do you think you're doing with that hose?
In a split-second decision, they turn the hose on the firefighters, spraying them with water.
CHAD (laughing) Run!
The group sprints away, leaving the confused and angry firefighters behind, shouting in protest.

The group's spirits lift, and a renewed sense of hope courses through their veins.
