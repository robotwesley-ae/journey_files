Find Nearest Neighbors: Identifying the nearest neighbors based on similarity scores reveals the most closely related phrases or text snippets to the input phrase. The knowledge transfer in this step goes from the similarity domain to the ranked nearest neighbors domain.
Analyze Nearest Neighbors: Examining the nearest neighbors helps understand the context and semantics of the input phrase in relation to other phrases. The knowledge transfer in this step involves moving from the ranked nearest neighbors domain to the contextual understanding and interpretation domain.

You are still definitely not following my instructions at all.

Generate Embeddings: By using pre-trained models, embeddings are generated for each token. These embeddings capture the semantics and relationships of words in a continuous vector space. The knowledge transfer in this step moves from the token domain to the continuous vector space domain.

What is a pre-trained model IN THIS CASE? 
what are mathematical graph embeddings and how do they capture semantics and relationships IN THIS CASE?
I apologize for the confusion. Let's discuss the embeddings in this specific case.
Pre-trained model: In this case, you would need a pre-trained model that can handle the phrase as a whole, rather than breaking it down into individual tokens. One possible approach could be to use a model that has been trained on a large corpus of text, where phrases or sentences have been treated as single entities. In this case, the embeddings would be generated for complete phrases or sentences, rather than individual words.
Mathematical graph embeddings: Graph embeddings are representations of graph structures (such as nodes or edges) in continuous vector spaces. These embeddings capture the relationships between the entities in the graph. In this specific case, assuming we have a graph where each node represents a phrase or sentence, and the edges between nodes capture some measure of semantic similarity, we would be looking for an embedding that captures the relationships between the phrases or sentences.
To obtain such embeddings, you could employ graph embedding techniques like node2vec or GraphSAGE, which are designed to generate embeddings for graph nodes that capture their structural and relational information. However, these techniques require that you already have a graph with relationships between phrases or sentences. One approach could be to use a text corpus to construct a co-occurrence or similarity-based graph, then apply these graph embedding techniques to obtain embeddings for phrases or sentences.
It's worth mentioning that finding a pre-trained model that can handle the specific phrase as a whole and generate meaningful embeddings might be challenging. In practice, most models are trained on individual words or subword units, which may not provide the desired outcome for your use case. One potential alternative could be training a custom model on a suitable dataset that captures the semantics and relationships you are interested in.

I need you to give me a high level, extremely connected and not generalized at all GENERAL DESCRIPTION of what a pre-trained model is, how information moves from outside of it into data and then is manipulated to create the training, how the training is completed, and then what the model is DOING (once it has been trained )to the input in order to process an output.
A pre-trained model, in the context of natural language processing, is a neural network that has been trained on a large dataset to learn patterns, structures, and relationships within the text. Here's a high-level, connected description of the entire process:
Data Collection and Preprocessing: A large corpus of text, such as articles, books, or webpages, is collected. This raw text is preprocessed, including tokenization (splitting text into words or subwords), normalization (lowercasing, stemming, or lemmatization), and removal of stopwords or irrelevant information. The preprocessed text is then converted into a numerical format, such as one-hot encoding, word embeddings (e.g., word2vec, GloVe), or other vector representations.
