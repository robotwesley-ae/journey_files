LINDA (whispering, panicked) What is that thing? Is it a rat? A mutant rat?
KEVIN (whispering) I don't know, but we need to get out of here before it attacks!
SUDDENLY, a loud squealing and hissing sound echoes from the darkness ahead. The unknown animal they had spotted earlier is now charging at them.
CHAD (panicked) Run! Crawl! Do something!
Panic sets in as Kevin, Chad, and Linda scramble to crawl away from the ferocious animal. They maneuver with difficulty, hindered by the low clearance under the stage, dodging and weaving around equipment and cables. The small but ferocious creature remains relentless, nipping at their heels and squealing in fury.
KEVIN (struggling) Keep moving! Don't let it catch up!
The animal leaps forward, sinking its teeth into Chad's leg. He screams in pain, and Kevin rushes to his aid, attempting to pull the animal off.
KEVIN (gritting his teeth) Hang on, Chad! I'll get it off you!
But the animal suddenly turns and bites down on Kevin's shoulder, causing him to scream in agonizing pain.
LINDA (frightened) Oh my god! Kevin!
Linda tries to help Kevin, but the animal redirects its attention and bites her left breast. Chaos ensues as all three fight desperately to fend off the creature's relentless assault.
CHAD (struggling) Get off! Get off!
LINDA (screaming) Somebody help us! Please!
Meanwhile, Chad spots a cable connector in their path, realizing its danger.
CHAD (panicking) Watch out! Cable connector!
But it's too late. In their frantic struggle, they accidentally roll over the connector, causing a sudden electrical surge.
The animal releases its grip, falling to the ground, momentarily stunned. However, the surge triggers a chain reaction, resulting in a complete power outage throughout the entire festival.
Panic spreads among the crowd as people scramble for their phones and flashlights, the darkness adding to the chaos and confusion.
KEVIN (gasping for breath) Is everyone okay? We need to find a way out of here, now!
They regroup in the darkness, their urgent whispers barely audible amidst the commotion.

INT. UNDERNEATH STAGE - NIGHT
Kevin, Chad, and Linda continue their sneaky crawl beneath the stage, tension palpable in the air.
CHAD (whispering) Well, that was one heck of a fall. But hey, accidents happen. At least we didn't get caught by those guards.
LINDA (whispering) Yeah, thank goodness for small miracles. But let's stay focused. We need to find a way out of here and fast.
KEVIN (whispering) Agreed. We can't afford any more setbacks. We have to keep moving.
Suddenly, they hear strange rustling noises, growing louder with each passing second.
CHAD (whispering, concerned) What's that sound? Is there something else down here with us?
LINDA (whispering, anxiously) I don't know, but it's getting closer. We need to be ready for anything.
KEVIN (whispering, determined) Stay calm, guys. We can handle whatever comes our way. Just stay together and stay alert.
SUDDENLY, a loud squealing and hissing sound echoes from the darkness ahead. The unknown animal they had spotted earlier is now charging at them.
LINDA (whispering, terrified) Oh no, what is that?!
CHAD (whispering, alarmed) I don't know, but it doesn't sound friendly. Get ready to defend yourselves!
The panic intensifies as the rustling sound draws nearer, mingling with the crowd's distant cheers.
KEVIN (whispering, urgently) Prepare to move! We need to avoid whatever that is and find an exit!
They brace themselves, ready to confront the imminent danger that awaits them in the darkness.
