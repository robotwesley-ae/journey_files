Chad's Mechanical Misjudgment: As they continue their precarious journey along the beam, Chad’s gaze fixates on a large counterweight pulley system adjacent to their path. This system helps balance the wheel's rotation. A wild idea strikes him: if he can use the pulley as a makeshift elevator, he might descend quicker. Over the humming of generators and distant bass beats, Kevin shouts at him to reconsider, noting that it’s not designed for human weight.
But Chad, ever the improviser, shrugs, flashes a mischievous grin, and hops onto the counterweight. For a split second, everything seems fine, and Chad even gives a triumphant laugh. However, the counterweight's pulley system isn’t built to handle sudden additional weight. There's a high-pitched squeal, a spray of sparks, and then a comedic sequence where Chad is jerked upwards before the counterweight cable snaps, flinging him outwards in a large arc. Kevin watches, a mix of shock and disbelief, as Chad becomes a brief human comet, soaring through the sky before vanishing from view amidst the tangle of festival tents and lights.

Here, Chad’s spontaneous idea introduces a mechanical mishap that adds both tension and humor to the narrative.
Could you rewrite all the beats, but incorporate this into it?

Absolutely! Here's the sequence of beats incorporating the mechanical mishap:

Stranded Situation: Kevin, Chad, and Linda find themselves trapped at the apex of a Ferris wheel pod during the Rolling Loud Festival. The minutes turn into seemingly endless hours and with no immediate rescue in sight, desperation to find a way down intensifies.
Initial Assessment: From their bird's-eye view, Linda identifies a neighboring pod slightly below them. Chad, confident due to his climbing experience, believes they might be able to leap to it, potentially using it as a starting point for their descent. Kevin, mindful of the inherent dangers, hesitates. But the trio's urgency trumps their reservations.
Linda’s Leap and Shocking Outcome: Linda goes first, using the pod's structure for leverage. However, as she nears the other pod, she misjudges her landing, slipping and plummeting into the dizzying depths below. Kevin and Chad are left in shock, the weight of her apparent fall heavy on their hearts.
Chad's Mechanical Misjudgment: As they try to regroup, Chad spots the large counterweight pulley system. Thinking it might offer a rapid descent, he dismisses Kevin's frantic warnings about it not being designed for human weight. Chad, always the risk-taker, jumps onto the counterweight. For a fleeting moment, it looks like his plan might work. However, the additional weight is too much for the pulley. After a brief jerking movement upwards, there's a sudden snap. Chad is catapulted outward, becoming a brief silhouette against the festival lights before vanishing amidst the tents below.
Kevin's Loneliness and Determination: With his friends gone, a heavy sense of loneliness engulfs Kevin. However, he's more determined than ever to get down safely. From his vantage point, he spots a giant teddy bear in a lower pod. Formulating a plan, he decides to use it as a cushion to aid his descent.
The Beam Walk: Kevin carefully starts navigating the Ferris wheel’s central beam, which offers a straight path to the teddy bear's pod. Every step is methodical, with him relying on the structure for support, the memories of his friends' fates pushing him to tread cautiously.
The Teddy Bear Stunt: Upon reaching the teddy bear's pod, Kevin negotiates swiftly with its reluctant owner, even offering money for the stuffed toy. Once acquired, Kevin positions himself at the edge, holding onto the teddy bear as his makeshift cushion. With a deep breath, he leaps from the Ferris wheel.
