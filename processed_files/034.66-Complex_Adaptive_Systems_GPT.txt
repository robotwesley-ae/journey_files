2 / 2
A Sanctuary coaching business can use clickfunnels and customer flows to guide potential clients through a smooth and engaging journey that ultimately leads to the conversion. Here's a step-by-step outline of an ideal customer flow:
Awareness:
Create content that raises awareness about Sanctuary principles and their benefits. This could include blog articles, social media posts, videos, podcasts, and webinars. Share this content on relevant platforms to attract potential clients interested in personal development and spiritual growth.
Lead magnet:
Offer a valuable resource, such as a free e-book, mini-course, or guided meditation, in exchange for the visitor's contact information. This lead magnet should showcase your expertise in Sanctuary coaching and provide immediate value to the potential client.
Email nurturing sequence:
Once a visitor has opted in for your lead magnet, send them a series of nurturing emails that provide additional valuable content, share success stories from your coaching clients, and introduce your Sanctuary coaching services. Make sure to personalize these emails and address the specific pain points or goals of your target audience.
Webinar or workshop:
Invite your email subscribers to a free live webinar or workshop that delves deeper into Sanctuary principles and offers actionable advice. Use this opportunity to demonstrate your coaching skills and build trust with potential clients.
Sales page:
After the webinar or workshop, direct attendees to a sales page that highlights your Sanctuary coaching packages, their benefits, and testimonials from satisfied clients. Emphasize the transformation your clients can achieve by working with you and offer a clear call-to-action (CTA) to book a discovery call or purchase your coaching services.
Discovery call:
Schedule a one-on-one discovery call with potential clients to discuss their needs, goals, and challenges. Use this opportunity to demonstrate how your Sanctuary coaching program can help them achieve their desired outcomes and address any concerns or objections they may have.
Onboarding:
Once a client has signed up for your coaching services, provide them with a seamless onboarding process that includes a welcome email, a coaching agreement, scheduling instructions, and access to any necessary resources or tools.
Coaching program delivery:
Deliver your Sanctuary coaching program through a combination of live coaching sessions, pre-recorded content, and supplementary resources. Ensure that your clients feel supported and motivated throughout their coaching journey.
Follow-up and upselling:
After completing your coaching program, follow up with clients to gather feedback and offer additional services, such as advanced coaching packages, group programs, or membership communities that align with their ongoing growth and development.
By designing a clickfunnel and customer flow that follows these steps, you can effectively guide potential clients through a nurturing and engaging journey that showcases the value of your Sanctuary coaching services and leads to successful conversions.
