EXpand on this section in FDX USING dialogue and not pros: As Kevin, Chad, and Linda try to make their way through the mosh pit, they're constantly knocked down by crowd surfers.

Chad even gets a few body slams in, Kevin accidentally elbows a drunk teenage girl in the face, sending her down, and Linda tries to shield herself from the chaos.

KEVIN (panicked) Sorry, sorry! Silence in a mosh pit, who knew? It's short-lived. A sudden onslaught of SILLY STRING and empty beer cans assail them. They try to shield themselves, but the crowd LIFTS them into the air. They SCREAM, passed around like beach balls. Chad and Kevin’s clothes are ripped off, leaving them in their underwear and socks. They leave Linda clothed. LINDA (offended) What, no one wants to see my bush!? The crowd crowd surfs them with a lot of energy, sending them flying a great distance, finally being tosses into a vendor’s tent, knocking it over. When they come to, they see that Linda is on fire and jump on her to put it out so she is safe.

INT. ROLLING LOUD FESTIVAL - MOSH PIT - NIGHT
A CROWD SURFER descends onto KEVIN, CHAD, and LINDA like a tidal wave. Chad rallies, body-slamming the offending surfer.
CHAD (yells) Off-road, guys, off-road!
The MOSH PIT isn't having it. The trio find themselves in the eye of the storm.

Linda jumps to the rescue.
LINDA (defensive) Accident! We're harmless, I swear!
It doesn't fly. The crowd is riled up, their night ruined by middle-aged men.
KEVIN (apologetic) Our bad, seriously!
An eerie silence. But not for long. The onslaught comes: SILLY STRING, empty beer cans. The crowd heaves them upwards. A human rollercoaster.
Their clothes are ripped away mid-flight, leaving them nearly naked, while Linda remains unscathed.
LINDA (offended) Excuse me, my saggy tits are fabulous!
They're unceremoniously dumped into a VENDOR'S TENT. As the dust settles, Linda's clothes catch fire. Kevin and Chad leap into action, smothering the flames.
