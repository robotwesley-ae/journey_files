Great. Now rewrite but add detail: Kevin rushes up to the receptionist in the security room, frantically explaining that his son is missing. The receptionist begins taking down the report and asks for his son's age. As the security guard who initially rejected them enters the room, Kevin decides to stick to his lie that his son is 16. However, the first security guard re-enters the room and confronts Kevin about previously telling him that his son was 13. Kevin takes a deep breath and admits the truth, feeling embarrassed and defensive as the security guards criticize his parenting choices. He explains that he didn't realize there was an age restriction and that he just wanted to bond with his son over their shared love of music. The security guards become increasingly offended, accusing Kevin of breaking the rules and putting his son in danger. As they move to cuff him, Kevin pushes one of them aside and manages to slip away, running back into the festival crowd. His heart races, knowing he's now a wanted man, but his primary focus remains on finding his son.
