CHAD (excited) Woo-hoo! Pyro party, baby!
The security guards are caught off guard, trying to shield themselves from the dazzling display of lights and loud sounds.
KEVIN (startled) Chad, what the hell are you doing?!
CHAD (grinning, not slowing down) Creating a distraction! It's a pyro party, man!
The receptionist watches in awe, and Kevin realizes Chad's plan might be just what they need to escape.
KEVIN (hesitant) Alright, let's go!
Chad continues to fire the fireworks blaster wildly, shooting vibrant bursts of pyrotechnics throughout the small tent. The sparks dance around them, filling the air with flashes of light.
SECURITY GUARD 1 (trying to regain control) Everyone, stay calm! This is not safe!
SECURITY GUARD 2 (dodging sparks) Stop that thing, now!
With the guards disoriented, Chad grabs Kevin's arm, and they make their escape through the tent flap, still surrounded by the chaotic spectacle of the pyrotechnics.
EXT. ROLLING LOUD VENUE - SECLUDED AREA - NIGHT
Kevin and Chad burst out of the security tent, sparks flying around them. They seek refuge behind a row of concession stands, catching their breath and still covered in pyro residue.
KEVIN (amused) Chad, you're nuts! But that was quite the distraction.
CHAD (laughing) Thanks, man! I always wanted to do something like that.
They take a moment to catch their breath, grateful for the opportunity to escape. Kevin wipes some pyro residue off his face.
KEVIN (relieved) Now, let's focus on finding my son.
CHAD (excited) Absolutely! That pyro show got us some time. Let's keep searching.
The adventure to find Zion has taken an explosive turn, leaving Kevin and Chad amidst the chaos of Rolling Loud's nighttime spectacle, determined to reunite Kevin with his son.
â€”---------
rewrite the following beats with my notes implemented: Kevin, Chad, and Linda find themselves stranded at the top of the Ferris wheel at Rolling Loud Festival. They realize they need to get down safely, and the height, combined with their intoxicated state, adds to the tension. Problem-Solving: As they brainstorm ways to descend, (save the teddy bear beat for the end and add in some actually smart ideas) Kevin suddenly spots a giant stuffed animal in one of the nearby pods. He excitedly suggests they use it as padding for their descent. The idea is met with giggles and immediate agreement. The Leap: Without wasting any time, Chad decides to go first. He leaps onto a neighboring pod, which happens to be occupied by a group of festival-goers. They're not eccentric characters but real people enjoying the festival. Chad briefly joins in on their conversation and laughter before leaping to another pod. Linda follows Chad, landing on a pod occupied by more festival-goers. They're dancing and having a great time. Linda joins in the fun for a moment before moving on. Kevin makes the final jump, landing on a pod where festival-goers are playing an impromptu game of cards. They share a few laughs and Kevin even plays a quick hand before continuing. (don't like the game of cards. again, this should be real) Close Call: As Linda attempts to jump to the next pod, she slips and dangles precariously from the edge, sending panic through Kevin and Chad. They reach out desperately to grab her. Just as it seems she might fall, they manage to pull her up and onto the pod. They share a relieved, intoxicated laugh before moving on. (are there other ideas that are just as scary that can be implemented into this scene? i want to feel the danger throughout. i want to feel like this is the movie, cliffhanger or free solo. Success: After a series of jumps and encounters with festival-goers, they (should see a pod with the teddy bear) reach a pod that contains the giant stuffed teddy bear. Kevin suggests they use it as padding for their final leap to the ground. With the teddy bear in tow, they make the daring jump, feeling a rush of adrenaline as they descend. (it should just be Kevin who jump with the Teddy Bear) (this should just
