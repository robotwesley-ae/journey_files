CHAD (to Linda) You're such a loser.
LINDA (defensive) I'm trying my best, okay?
The energy in the air is electric.
INTERCUT WITH:
EXT. FESTIVAL STAGE - ROLLING LOUD VENUE - NIGHT
SHENSEEA (pointing to the crowd) Alright, my friend here wants someone to join us on stage and dance! Pick someone, my friend!
IN THE CROWD
Kevin has an idea. He turns to Chad and Linda, his eyes filled with determination.
KEVIN (inspired) Wait... If I can get on stage, Zion can see me.
CHAD (excited) That's a great idea. Let's do it.
The trio pushes through the dense crowd, facing the challenge of reaching the front.
CHAD (determined) This crowd is like a solid wall!
Kevin, Chad, and Linda's banter adds to the chaos and slows their progress.
Linda confidently flashes her volunteer badge, allowing them to maneuver through checkpoints and restricted areas with relative ease.
KEVIN (desperate) We're almost there!
Finally, after what feels like an eternity, they reach the front where bouncers work tirelessly to control the crowd.
ON STAGE
Eviana spots Kevin dancing like a crazy person.
LITTLE PERSON (excitedly) Hey, you! Get up here!
Bouncers initially try to hold Kevin back, unsure about letting him on stage. But seeing that Eviana has chosen him, they reluctantly assist Kevin, guiding him through the crowd.
KEVIN (out of breath) I... made it!
The crowd cheers, unaware of the chaos unfolding in Kevin's personal life.

Great. Now rewrite, but let's have them separate and use the walkie talkies throughout this scene, but let's have the scene be the same. Just that they are seperated and talking through the walkies and it's hard to hear and the codes are making it hard to commincate

EXT. ROLLING LOUD VENUE - NIGHT
Using Linda's volunteer credentials to navigate the festival grounds, KEVIN, CHAD, and LINDA separate from each other in the crowded venue. Each of them holds a walkie-talkie, attempting to communicate, but the noise and the confusion of the codes make it difficult to understand each other clearly.
LINDA (via walkie-talkie, distorted) Is that him? Over.
KEVIN (via walkie-talkie, distorted) Negative. That's not him. Over.
CHAD (via walkie-talkie, distorted) Guys, remember the plan. Stay focused. Over.
The performance on stage by SHENSEEA continues, captivating the crowd. The noise amplifies, making the walkie-talkie communication even more challenging.
LINDA (via walkie-talkie, strained) I... think I found him. Over.
KEVIN (via walkie-talkie, struggling to hear) Say again? Did you find him? Over.
CHAD (via walkie-talkie, interrupting) That's not him, Linda. Remember, we need to find a way on stage. Over.
LINDA (via walkie-talkie, frustrated) I can't hear you clearly! Say again! Over.
KEVIN (via walkie-talkie, shouting) I said it's not him! Stick to the plan! Over.
CHAD (via walkie-talkie, annoyed) Linda, we need to regroup. Let's meet at the main entrance. Over.
LINDA (via walkie-talkie, struggling to hear) Meet... main entrance... got it! Over.
The chaos of the festival, combined with the distorted communication, creates confusion and frustration for the trio as they continue their search for Zion.
KEVIN (via walkie-talkie, determined) Don't give up, guys. We'll find him. Stay strong. Over.
CHAD (via walkie-talkie, determined) Roger that. We'll regroup and keep going. Over.
LINDA (via walkie-talkie, determined) I'll make my way to the main entrance. Over and out.
Despite the challenges in communication, the determination in their voices remains strong. They navigate through the crowd, following the plan, and strive to reunite and continue their search for Zion.
