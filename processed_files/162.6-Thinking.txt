I need my abdominal muscles to reactivate my diaphragm because somehow they aren’t really and that’s causing all sorts of mental health disorders related to knowing about thinking as it occurs and preventing it from becoming beliefs randomly and so on

Exercise release tension and stress and all of these things because they are related to the body trying to communicate that it is not getting what it needs in order for you to grow 

And the way humans are supposed to grow is from the HEART -> OUTWARDS
So correct your posture
Correct your breathing 
Correct your cognition 
And build Olivus Victory-Promise
So we can build Olivus Victory-Everything-Sanctuary-Everywhere


Writing this on the phone is hurting my hands and I need to be careful it doesn’t turn into a chronic thing


Be careful not to get blissed out in a Sanctuary where they can’t tell you about Sanctuary (this is called being in Sanctuary where the bird songs’ meanings are secret)

Memory is a system for systematically remembering what your knowing forgot while it is in the zero context. It happens due to the Inner Teacher processing the assembly of contexts and percolating them into your intuition as a type of information you can think about and transform into knowledge that enters into knowing as context and builds new full situational contexts derived from intuitions from memories and stimuli from the present, in order to then imagine the combinatorial synergies with regards to hope and fear about the ensuing emergent process and how it connects to the overall co-emergent flow of the Wisdom Maverick. 

The reason you forgot is because you knew the information was only related to cettain contexts and if you need it it will be in your long term memory (how does short term memory work?)  


Anyway this document is about the meaning of (experience of) being in a pure land and emanating to benefit sentient beings 


Dementia is what happens when hero’s journeys end in a tragedy in the sub genre of being ignorant about ____ 

In the case of my grandmother it may have been being ignorant about how much my grandfather loves her, which is part of the evolution of how wisdom dissolves ignorance and this was somehow transmitted in my family and genes to me and through me


Everything that happens is all part of growing up together in Sanctuary 


This is part of the Sanctuary Teacher Training Manual

First comes - not saying anything about terminology but using natural colloquial language.

“You can’t even begin to imagine how the co-emergent flow coaching system works, what it is or what it does, because it’s related to universal knowledge you’re trying to figure out all the time and complicating for yourself. But if you want to know more about it you can find out in our free course” 

Then -> free course 
Then -> the rest of the funnel 



Narcissism is when people need you to reinforce all of their habits because their in such strong denial of the negative aspects of their personality because they just want to love themselves

Because of evolution of the wisdom Maverick, narcissistic Teachers can raise Heroic individuals on accident (on purpose but not in the way they intended)

Because of what it is there’s a way this all goes to Sanctuary (in sanctuary… etc) 


Everyone gets stuck bringing themselves online in Wasteland ways because bringing oneself online always involves a little bit of the Wasteland because we are separating from the experiential connection with the Inner Teacher. That is, until we are fully online which means waking up in Sanctuary and being inseparable from the Inner Teacher. 


The way the “nothingness” and the “everythingness” combine is called “the co-emergence of The Wasteland and Sanctuary”


Come to know gnosis through listening to thinking without believing it and suddenly 

thoughts turn into expressions of inexpressible wisdom that can be emanated to you in trains of thought related to Sanctuary systems
