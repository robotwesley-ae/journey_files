Together, they stumble through the crowd, looking for any sign of the girls. Jeremy's intoxication and highness make it difficult to focus, but he's determined to find them. Eventually, they spot the girls near the main stage, dancing and laughing.
Jeremy walks over to them, stumbling a bit, and starts flirting with them. He tells them he needs their help getting into the VIP section and asks if they can lend them their bracelets. The girls giggle and playfully tease Jeremy, but eventually agree to help them out.
With the VIP bracelets in hand, Jeremy and Chad make their way to the VIP section, trying to act casual and blend in with the crowd. They're both nervous and excited, wondering which celebrity Zion could be trying to meet.
As they make their way through the section, they spot a few famous faces, but none of them are Zion. Jeremy starts to panic, thinking they've come all this way for nothing. But just as he's about to give up hope, he spots Zion, standing near the back of the section, looking around nervously.
Jeremy rushes over to him, relieved to have found his son. Zion looks embarrassed and ashamed, but Jeremy doesn't care. All that matters is that they're together again.
As they leave the VIP section and head back out into the festival, Jeremy and Chad can't stop grinning. They've been through so much over the course of the night, but they've finally found Zion. They walk through the crowd, arm in arm, feeling a sense of triumph and joy.

Can we incorporate the idea that Jeremy has the girls snapchat as a way to contact them
ChatGPT
Sure, here's a rewrite that incorporates the girls' Snapchat:
As Chad finishes his emotional story, Jeremy's phone rings, interrupting their conversation. It's a call from his wife, who's furious and yelling on the other end of the line. Apparently, Zion butt-dialed her, and she heard everything -- including his son's voice saying something about sneaking into the VIP section to meet a celebrity.
Jeremy's mind races as he tries to come up with a plan. He remembers the two girls from earlier who were flirting with them and had VIP bracelets. He quickly pulls out his phone and searches through his Snapchat contacts, finding them on his list. He sends them a quick message, asking if they can help him get into the VIP section.
The girls respond almost immediately, excited to hear from him. They tell him to meet them at the entrance to the VIP area and they'll try to sneak him in. Jeremy and Chad hurry through the crowd, dodging dancers and dodging wayward glow sticks.
As they approach the entrance, they see the girls waving to them from behind the velvet rope. They flash their VIP bracelets, and the security guard nods them through. Jeremy and Chad follow the girls into the VIP section, feeling like they've just entered a different world.
They scan the crowds, looking for any sign of Zion. Suddenly, they spot him, standing next to a group of teenagers near the stage. He looks up and sees his father and Chad, surprised to see them there. But before he can say anything, the music starts up, and the crowd roars to life.
Jeremy and Chad push their way closer to the stage, hoping to get closer to Zion. The girls are right behind them, cheering them on. But as they get closer, the crowds get thicker, and they start to lose sight of Zion.
Jeremy starts to panic, realizing that he's lost Zion again. He turns to Chad and the girls, desperate for help. But before they can react, the crowds around them start to surge, pushing them apart.
Jeremy feels a hand grab his shoulder, and he turns to see Zion, smiling and laughing. He's surrounded by the same group of teenagers as before, but this time he looks happy and carefree.
Jeremy pulls Zion into a hug, relieved to have found him again. Chad and the girls cheer, and for a moment, everything seems perfect. But as they start to make their way out of the VIP section, Jeremy can't shake the feeling that something isn't right. He knows that he and Zion have a lot to talk about, and he's not sure how they're going to work things out. But for now, he's just glad to have found his son again.
