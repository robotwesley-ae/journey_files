So if we turn these into flows, it might look like:

Tier 1:
Users on this tier experience a flow of low cost/free materials and courses but do not receive any help other than cursory interactions with us on social media if they are lucky

Tier 2:
Users on this tier experience a flow of premium cost courses and receive tons of help but at the end of the day we dont provide any 1 on 1 services to make sure they are progressing on the path after the courses are over, other than parasocial interactions with them

Tier 3: 
Users on this tier experience a flow of premium cost courses and receive tons of help as well as extremely premium cost coaching 1 on 1 with an expert for a year, where we make sure they are working through the system
That's a great way to structure the offerings based on the different tiers. Here's a revised outline of the three tiers based on the flows you described:
Tier 1: Basic Experience
Low-cost or free Sanctuary System materials and courses.
Limited access to support and resources.
Occasional interaction with the team on social media platforms.
Tier 2: Premium Experience
