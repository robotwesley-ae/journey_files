 and kind of a crazy cat and makes fun of him for being a bit of a square â€“ think Frank the Tank. "As they walk back into the crowd, Chad tries to lighten the mood. "Hey, man, you want to grab a drink? My treat." Kevin eyes him skeptically, remembering his earlier drink mishap. "I don't know, man. I don't want to be irresponsible." Chad laughs. "Come on, live a little. It's Rolling Loud, after all." Kevin hesitates but then shrugs. Maybe a drink will help calm his nerves. "Okay, sure. One drink."

Chad raises his eyebrows, impressed by Kevin's sudden willingness to let loose. "Whoa, the old Kevin is coming out to play," he teases, nudging him with his elbow. Kevin rolls his eyes, knowing that Chad's not wrong. He used to be the life of the party, always up for a good time and never taking things too seriously. But somewhere along the way, he became a bit of a square. Maybe it was the responsibilities of fatherhood or the pressures of his career, but he lost that spark that made him so fun and carefree. But now, as he takes a sip of the drink Chad hands him, he feels a small flicker of that old Kevin starting to come back to life. Maybe this weekend will be the perfect opportunity to let loose and rediscover himself.

We need a bad guy threat in this movie. Who is the bad guy? Is there a security guard on his tail? Is there are tough concertgoer that Kevin offends that is chasing? Does the wife show up? Looking for some suggestions

One idea could be to have a rival group of festival-goers who are causing trouble throughout the event. Perhaps they are a group of rowdy frat boys who keep getting into fights and causing chaos. Kevin and Chad unwittingly cross paths with them and end up on their bad side, leading to a confrontation towards the end of the movie. This could add an element of danger and tension to the story, with the frat boys acting as the main antagonists for Kevin and Chad.

Another suggestion please

What about a rival father-son duo who are also searching for Zion and trying to outdo Kevin and Chad at every turn? They could be competitive and always one step ahead, causing tension and conflict throughout the movie.
