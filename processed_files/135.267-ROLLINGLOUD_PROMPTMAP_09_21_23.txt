write the following into FDX: Cut to Melanie at home, her expression filled with concern as she dials Kevin's number on the phone. Cut to: Back at the festival, Kevin, Chad, Linda, and the two girls find themselves on the dance floor, lost in the music and the high-energy atmosphere. Under the influence and feeling the beat, they move their bodies in a sensual grind. Chad tries to push Linda away from the group, but she keeps coming back, persistent and seemingly oblivious to Chad's efforts to distance her. The heightened sensations from their earlier indulgence only add to the intensity of their dance floor experience. Kevin's phone rings. He reaches for it, hoping it's Zion, but instead, it's his wife. He hesitates for a moment, not sure if he should answer, but decides to take the call. "Hey honey, how's it going?" he says, trying to sound casual. "Good, good," his wife replies. "Is everything okay there?" "Everything's great!" Kevin says, trying to sound upbeat. "That's nice," his wife says. "What about Avatar? How's the movie?" "Avatar?" Kevin repeats, confused. "Yes, Avatar," his wife says. "That's where you said you were going, remember?" Kevin's mind races, trying to come up with an excuse for his mistake. "Oh, right. Yeah, the movie. Itâ€™s great! Really intense!" "That's good to hear," his wife says. "What about Zion? How's he doing?" He lies, saying that everything is great with a big smile on his face, trying to sound casual. His wife starts to grill him, asking for more details. Kevin feels like he's backed into a corner and starts to sweat. He can hear Chad and Linda making inappropriate comments in the background and the two girls flirting, which makes it even harder to concentrate on the conversation. Meanwhile, the girls are now getting impatient and start rubbing on Kevin, making it even more difficult for him to focus on the call. He tries to shoo them away, but they're persistent. He's stuck between a rock and a hard place, not wanting to reveal the truth about Zion to his wife, but also not wanting to lead the girls on. As his wife starts challenging what he's saying, Chad chimes in with a rude comment, "Hey Linda, I think they need you over at the cockblock section!" Linda rolls her eyes and mutters something about cutting off Chad's penis. Kevin tries to focus on the call, but it's becoming increasingly difficult with Chad and Linda's antics. Kevin tries to speak louder to drown out the noise in the background, "Sorry, honey, the movie is just so loud right now. We're really enjoying it. Zion loves it!" He glances at Chad and Linda, signaling them to make noise to make it sound like they're in a theater. "But I gotta go now, people are giving me dirty looks for talking on the phone in here. Love you, bye!" He quickly ends the call, relieved that he's avoided getting caught. The girls continue to flirt with him and make inappropriate comments, but suddenly, the stars must have aligned because Kevin's phone comes to life with a slew of notifications from Zion's Snapchat account. He frantically opens the app, scrolling through the messages until his eyes settle on a picture of Zion jumping alongside a large crowd. "Thank god," Kevin mutters to himself, relieved that he's finally found a clue to Zion's whereabouts. He quickly shows the picture to Chad and Linda. Linda's eyes widen as she recognizes something in the photo. "I know which stage that is!" she exclaims. "I recognize that banner hanging from the stage. It's part of the volunteer setup!"
