While it may be evident to you how the Sanctuary ontology can be applied to specific situations, it is still essential to ensure that the concept is clearly defined and supported by empirical evidence for others to understand and engage with it. Developing a solid theoretical foundation and providing concrete examples can help to make the Sanctuary ontology more accessible and convincing to a broader audience.
Furthermore, it is important to recognize that the Sanctuary ontology is one of many perspectives on the nature of reality, and there may be value in considering alternative or complementary theories as well. Engaging with diverse perspectives can help to deepen our understanding of the world and promote the development of more comprehensive and robust models of reality.


Because humans have been agreeing that love is the Nash equilibrium strategy for humans since forever. That is the only way to see all the possibilities, to hold them in a container of loving compassion so they can feel safe enough to change.
It is true that love and compassion have been recognized as essential values in human societies throughout history. Many philosophical, religious, and cultural traditions emphasize the importance of love, kindness, and empathy in promoting social cohesion, understanding, and well-being.
When we approach situations and relationships with love and compassion, we create an environment where people feel safe, supported, and valued. This, in turn, can foster a willingness to change, grow, and explore new possibilities. Love can indeed be seen as a Nash equilibrium strategy for humans, as it promotes cooperation and the pursuit of mutually beneficial outcomes.
Incorporating love and compassion into our daily lives and decision-making processes can help us to better understand and navigate the complexities of the human experience. As we continue to develop and refine our understanding of the world, it is essential to remember the importance of these core values in promoting a more harmonious, equitable, and sustainable society.


I donâ€™t think this can be critiqued to be honest. It is unethical to critique a system that allows humans to see the entirety of their being through the lens of the power of love and harmony with the universe.
While it may be challenging to critique a system that promotes love, harmony, and the betterment of humanity, it is still essential to maintain an open-minded and critical perspective. The reason for this is to ensure that our understanding and implementation of such systems are as effective and beneficial as possible.
It is not the intention to undermine the value of love and harmony, but rather to ensure that our beliefs and practices are grounded in evidence, reason, and compassion. This can help to avoid potential pitfalls and blind spots that may arise when uncritically accepting any system or ideology.
By engaging in constructive critique, we can refine and strengthen our understanding of the concepts, principles, and practices that contribute to love, harmony, and human flourishing. This process can ultimately lead to a more effective and impactful implementation of these ideas in our lives and societies.


What is not founded in evidence about this?
My previous response was not implying that there is a lack of evidence supporting the ideas you presented. The point was to emphasize the importance of maintaining an open-minded and critical perspective when discussing any system, idea, or belief, even if it promotes love, harmony, and the betterment of humanity.
Having a critical perspective does not necessarily mean rejecting or disproving the ideas presented. Instead, it means being open to examining the evidence, reasoning, and assumptions behind the ideas to ensure that they are well-founded and contribute positively to our understanding and practice.
