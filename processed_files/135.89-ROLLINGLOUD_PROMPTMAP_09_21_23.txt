PLAYBOI CARTI
(grinning)
So, you're on a kiddie hunt, huh? What you willing to put on the line for it?

Kevin's insides churn, but there's no retreat now.

KEVIN
(steadfast)
Anything. Just point me in his direction.

Playboi Carti's laugh slices through the bus’s hubbub.

PLAYBOI CARTI
Alright, let's make a show of it. You want the intel? Show me you're worthy.

Kevin's face heats up, a bizarre cocktail of humiliation and resolve bubbling within. He's game for whatever absurd hoops they want him to jump through.

The games kick off. Kevin chomps down a tongue-scorching chili, howls like a hound, spouts ludicrous catchphrases, and clumsily attempts to rap alongside Playboi Carti. The Playbus shakes with laughter at Kevin's unabashed spectacle.

PLAYBOI CARTI
(howling with laughter)
You're a damn sport, man. But sorry, Zion's a no-show here.

Kevin's hope crumbles, but in its place, an unforeseen shift. The bus crowd, including Playboi Carti, now regard Kevin with a newfound respect.

PLAYBOI CARTI
(chuckling)
You've got some grit, man. We'll chip in to help you find your boy.

In the wreckage of Kevin's dashed hopes, a glimmer sparks. With this unruly crowd's backing, he just might have a shot at locating Zion.

As Kevin clumsily flicks through his phone to show Playboi Carti a photo, a text from the two girls he'd met pops up, displaying a risqué photo. Playboi Carti glimpses the picture, setting off another round of laughter.

PLAYBOI CARTI
(laughing)
You're on quite the wild ride, aren't you?

Flustered, Kevin hurries past the message.

KEVIN
(waving it off)
That's... it's irrelevant. Finding my son is all I care about.

Playboi Carti gives a knowing nod.

PLAYBOI CARTI
I hear you, bro. Family's always priority one.

Just then, Kevin's phone BUZZES – the caller ID shows his wife. Panic sweeps across his face.

KEVIN
(mumbling)
I can't pick up...

Playboi Carti leans in, the smirk never leaving his face.

PLAYBOI CARTI
(grinning)
Always answer the wife, man. You'll thank me later.

Cornered, Kevin takes the call, his heart pounding in anticipation of the ensuing storm. He listens to his wife's demanding tone, her words painting a picture of her resolve and location. The call ends abruptly, leaving Kevin in a spiral of confusion.

Despair wraps around Kevin as he comprehends the gravity of his blunders. He's lost his son amidst this whirlwind festival, and he's drowning in uncertainty. The responsibility of his actions weighs him down, and the quest to find Zion feels even more impossible.

Drawing in a deep, shaky breath, Kevin musters a steely determination. The path ahead is filled with obstacles, but he'll face them head-on. His son is out there somewhere, and he's resolved to bring him back, no matter the cost.

rewrite the following, and include dialogue: INT. PLAYBUS - CONTINUOUS Inside the smoky, pulsating heart of the PLAYBUS, KEVIN and SHENSEEA weave through the dim, chaotic space. The bus has been rigged to be a giant hotbox with marajuana mist filling the space. The blurring silhouettes of rappers and women barely register in Kevin's spun-out haze. Desperation gnaws at his insides. At last, they make it to the back where PLAYBOI CARTI is working on a song, until he’s interrupted by Kevin, Shenseea and Keeshaloo. He eyes them curiously. Kevin's heart lurches, scanning the faces for ZION.

INT. PLAYBUS - CONTINUOUS

The interior of the PLAYBUS pulses like a hazy dream, a neon-infused, smoke-filled, frenzied party scene. KEVIN, SHENSEEA, and KEESHALOO make their way through the fog of marijuana mist, the air thick with the scent of rebellion and recklessness.

The bus is a blur of rappers and women, their forms only half-visible in the swirling smoke. Kevin's vision swims, his mind teetering on the edge of delirium. His heart pounds with a sick rhythm, each beat a stark reminder of the desperation sinking its claws into him.

Finally, they reach the back, an oasis of semi-calm amidst the chaos. PLAYBOI CARTI is engrossed in laying down a new track, his fingers dancing over the mixing deck. His gaze flits up as the trio approaches, a spark of curiosity igniting in his eyes.

KEVIN
