For Awakened beings, thought-feelings arise as the perfect play of the display of wisdom mind pregnant with the two paths
Like the play between their awakening nexus merged with the entire heroic lineage and the qualities of Awakening 
Which is viewed directly from Identityless wisdom and continually reveals itself as primordial positivity 
And the resultant thought-feeling is stored in the awakening nexus as a treasure, for sentient beings to accidentally find through putting a finger on their own suffering and help themselves with on the path, through auspicious connection between the awakening nexus, itself, represented by the awakened being’s awakening nexus, and the sentient being’s own awakening nexus.
Even though it is actually stainless, this treasure can still be viewed by sentient beings as being pregnant with the two paths 
But can also be viewed as the perfect play of the display of wisdom and left to naturally dissolve

{If you’re reading this book, you should really prioritize understanding that last part about perceiving awakened beings}

So just cultivate this view of infinitely perfect goodness while being utterly yourself without any fear of imperfection whatsoever, and when anything stops that continuous flow of Identityless goodness, reestablish it in your experience regardless because it has no conditions at all, since it is the condition. If you can’t do it, you’re doing it wrong, and that means there’s nothing to do but let your mind open, and that in turn means your concepts will dissolve and realign themselves with this Identityless goodness of the wisdom intent of timeless webbed infinitude of infinite perfection. Letting that happen cultivating the wisdom of the display of the timeless webbed infinitude of infinite perfection.  

Stages of Learning

Stage 1

At first ordinary individuals notice their own and others’ negative thought-feelings and wish to be rid of them and pursue worldly ways of accomplishing that to various degrees, usually while putting themselves before others 

Stage 2

Then, ordinary individuals decide the teachings of awakening are the best method to accomplish the aims of themselves (even if these are already altruistic aims)

Stage 3

Part 1
Then, ordinary individuals decide awakening is the best method of accomplishment 

These ordinary heroic individuals resultantly decide to cultivate the ability to keep the promises of the path of awakening 

Part 2 
Then, ordinary heroic individuals cultivate the ability to keep the promises on the path of awakening

Part 3
Then, ordinary heroic individuals gradually awaken according to their capacity

For royal, Awakening individuals, there are then stages of ability: 

The five poisons begin to leak their final breaths one by one 
as they resolve into 
the display of wisdom
And abilities 
well forth 
as the result 
writing poems of realization 
“Revealing” general conditions such as places, cities, people, stories, events, teachings, and anything else that can be used by sentient beings on their path to awakening… 
Up until “revealing” entire “universes of universes of sentient beings and awakening activity” in every moment, within the expanse of their own wisdom minds
From then on, this wisdom mind continues to reveal itself through revelation. 
The reason lifeforce severance happens at the end of revelation is because all that that Awakened One could do for sentient beings in that emanation is complete. 
This is completely perfect Awakening. 
Other than the complete totality of the above, it is not worth considering what the experience of a completely Awakened being might be. 

Once the body breaks at death, the above process continually happens as a universal reality. But with implicit realization, we are still stuck in the body of this “I” and its related obscurations, until it is destroyed and the Identityless Wisdom Essence of Wisdom Mind is revealed directly, along with all its radiant display of perfection.
