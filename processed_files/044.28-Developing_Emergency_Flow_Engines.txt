Fine-tuning the model on conversations with a Wolfram-enabled GPT could indeed be a promising approach. By using a Wolfram-enabled GPT, you can take advantage of the extensive knowledge base and computational capabilities of Wolfram Alpha to help enhance the model's understanding of various concepts and relationships. This can lead to more accurate embeddings and better performance in tasks related to the specific domain.
To fine-tune the model with Wolfram-enabled GPT, you would need to follow these steps:
Collect a dataset of conversations involving Wolfram-enabled GPT. This dataset should ideally contain various examples of domain-specific queries, responses, and interactions.
Pre-process the dataset by tokenizing the text and converting it into the format required by your model.
Train your model on this dataset, making sure to implement any necessary modifications to accommodate the Wolfram-enabled GPT integration. This may involve customizing the model architecture, loss functions, or training objectives.
Evaluate the performance of the fine-tuned model on a test set of conversations to ensure it has improved in the specific domain.
Iterate on the fine-tuning process by adjusting hyperparameters, model architecture, or training data to further enhance the model's performance.
By following these steps, you can create a more powerful model capable of handling complex domain-specific tasks and resolving abstraction hallucinations more effectively. However, keep in mind that this process may require significant computational resources and expertise in fine-tuning neural network models.

Right. basically what I want to do is take something like wolfram GPT and have it integrate the ontology of the wisdom maverick into its dataset so it can output the mathematical consequences
Integrating the ontology of the wisdom maverick into a Wolfram-enabled GPT model can help the model output the mathematical consequences associated with this specific domain. To achieve this, you can follow these steps:
Collect and curate the wisdom maverick ontology: Gather all relevant information and concepts related to the wisdom maverick ontology. This may include domain-specific vocabulary, relationships, rules, or any other information that characterizes the ontology.
Encode the ontology into a structured format: Convert the collected information into a machine-readable format, such as RDF, OWL, or any other suitable format that can be easily processed by the model.
Create a dataset: Generate a dataset of conversations or examples that involve the use of the wisdom maverick ontology. This dataset should cover various scenarios, queries, and interactions relevant to the domain.
Pre-process the dataset: Tokenize the text and convert it into the format required by your Wolfram-enabled GPT model.
Fine-tune the model: Train your model on the dataset, making sure to integrate the wisdom maverick ontology into the model's architecture, loss functions, or training objectives as necessary.
Evaluate performance: Test the performance of the fine-tuned model on a set of conversations to ensure it has improved in the specific domain and can output the mathematical consequences related to the wisdom maverick ontology.
Iterate: Make any necessary adjustments to the fine-tuning process, hyperparameters, model architecture, or training data to enhance the model's performance in handling the wisdom maverick ontology.
By following these steps, you can create a more powerful Wolfram-enabled GPT model that can output the mathematical consequences associated with the wisdom maverick ontology. Keep in mind that this process may require significant computational resources and expertise in fine-tuning neural network models.

Is there such thing as a GPT that is constantly updating its memory across conversations?
As of my knowledge cutoff date in September 2021, GPT-like models do not possess the capability to continuously update their memory across different conversations
