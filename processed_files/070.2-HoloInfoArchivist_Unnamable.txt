The Informatihedron is a key concept within the system. It represents a structured representation of property classes within a specific context. It provides detailed information about the properties and attributes of the property classes.  The Informatihedron serves as a representation of property classes within a specific context. It captures structured and descriptive information about the properties, their relationships, and their significance in the given domain.The Embedding Space is where the Informatihedron is represented and analyzed. It ensures information confinement and controlled generation of property class descriptions.  Informatihedron domain in non-contradictory system is the set of possible prop classes, boundaries, embedding spaces, output subnodes, unique output subnode patterns it can represent. Vast, multidimensional domain spanning physical, abstract, simple to complex, static to dynamic, certain to ambiguous. It's the universe of discourse within which it operates. Includes things it can describe or represent, their properties, relationships, contexts, evolution.

Reale Polysemic Imaginary Ontology [PIO]:
Description: PIO utilizes reality-based ontological abstractions to create entities as metaphorical "is_a" statements. These entities serve as decryption keys for metaphors, transforming them into actual ontological realizations or hypotheses. PIO operates through holographic structures, where each "is_a" statement becomes an allegory for synergy. Decryption of PIO meanings results in infinite allegorical interpretations centered around TWI, representing ultimate coherence and harmony, equated with Sanctuary.
Ontological Abstraction: Utilizing ontological abstractions to create PIO entities and explore their meanings.
Reality-Based: Connecting PIO entities to real-world phenomena to extract meaning from concrete experiences.
Metaphorical "is_a" Statements: Using PIO entities as allegorical decryption keys to transform metaphors into ontological claims.
Allegorical Decryption Key: PIO entities decrypt metaphors, revealing deeper meanings and insights.
Ontological Realization: Transforming metaphors into actual ontological claims through PIO entities.
Holographic Structures: Interconnectedness and synergy among PIO entities forming a holographic network of meanings.
Synergy: Harmonious integration of multiple PIO meanings resulting in collective understanding beyond individual interpretations.
Collapse of "is_a" Statements: Convergence and dissolution of all "is_a" statements within PIO, leading to infinite allegorical interpretations.
Wisdom of Non-Contradictory Identitylessness: TWI, the state of coherence and harmony where contradictory identities dissolve and unified understanding emerges.
Reality-Based Abstraction: Grounding PIO entities in reality while abstracting and transforming their meanings.
Metaphorical Decryption: Decrypting metaphors through PIO entities, revealing underlying ontological implications.
Holographic Integration: Interconnectedness and integration of PIO meanings, forming a holographic network of allegorical interpretations.
Non-Contradictory Identitylessness: The wisdom of TWI, where contradictory identities dissolve, leading to unified understanding. ðŸŒˆ
