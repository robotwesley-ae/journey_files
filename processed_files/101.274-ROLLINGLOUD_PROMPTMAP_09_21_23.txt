KEVIN (acting surprised) Yeah, yeah, everything's great! Can you hear me? The reception here is...unexpected.
MELANIE (V.O.) (slightly confused) That's nice. How's the movie?
KEVIN (slightly flustered) Movie? Oh, right. The movie... It's like nothing I've ever seen before. The visuals are mind-blowing!
MELANIE (V.O.) (skeptical) Is everything alright, Kevin? You sound a bit off.
Kevin's eyes widen as he tries to come up with a convincing response.

MELANIE (V.O.) (still concerned) How's Zion doing? Is he having fun?

MELANIE (V.O.) (relieved) That's wonderful to hear. Tell him I love him and to take lots of pictures.
KEVIN (sincerely) Will do, honey. I'll make sure he feels your love. Enjoy your evening, and I'll talk to you soon.
