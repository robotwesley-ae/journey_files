 eyes dart around the crowded venue, a sense of urgency gripping him. He spots a row of portapotties nearby, his anxiety growing as he realizes the time-sensitive nature of his situation.
ZION (to Kevin, anxiously) Dad, I need to use the restroom now. I've been monitoring the set times, and I calculated that if I go now, I won't miss any of my favorite acts. The next available window is in two hours, but I can't risk missing it.
Kevin looks at Zion, his concern evident in his eyes. He knows how important this schedule is to his son.
KEVIN (reassuringly) Alright, Zion. Take your time and do what you need to do. We'll meet at the food truck when you're done.
Zion nods, his focus solely on executing his plan. He hurries towards the closest available stall, his mind racing with precise calculations and reminders.
ZION (to himself) Avoid touching any surfaces, use hand sanitizer, and keep the time in mind. I can't let my anxiety ruin this experience.
Kevin watches Zion, his heart going out to his son. He knows the challenges Zion faces and respects his meticulous approach to navigating the festival.
As Zion reaches for the door handle, Kevin can't help but add one last piece of advice, his voice projecting louder than intended.
KEVIN (loudly, drawing attention) And remember, Zion, wash your hands thoroughly!
A few nearby festival-goers turn and stare, causing Zion to feel a pang of embarrassment. He quickly enters the stall, determined to execute his plan flawlessly, while Kevin, realizing his slip, blushes and looks around, hoping to blend back into the lively crowd.

write the following scene in FDX format as a continuation of the screenplay/Kevin is waiting in line when he hears someone call his name. He turns around and spots Chad, a charismatic but aimless man in his late 40s (picture Will Ferrell). Chad recognizes him from high school and enthusiastically greets him. As an old acquaintance and an enthusiastic festival-goer, Chad's character resembles John Candy's from Planes, Trains and Automobilesâ€”well-intentioned but clumsy, causing humorous mishaps and awkward situations. Loyal and caring, Chad's attempts to help others can backfire. He struggles to find success in life, drifting between odd jobs and failed ventures. Chad claims to be an expert on the chef of the vegan food truck, passionately describing the chef's culinary journey and insisting that he knows the best items on the menu. He takes it upon himself to order for Kevin, enthusiastically rattling off a list of dishes that would easily feed a small army. When the total comes up, Chad insists on paying for the entire order, brushing off Kevin's protests with a wave of his hand. As Chad reaches into his pocket to pay for the food, he pulls out a wad of cash that catches Kevin's eye. The amount of money is surprisingly large, raising eyebrows and prompting a questioning glance from Kevin. Chad seems unfazed by the attention and casually remarks, "Never put your money in a bank, Kevin. It's much safer on your person. And if it's lost, then at least it's on you and not some dumb corporate bank." Kevin decides not to press the issue. Despite his growing worry about Zion's whereabouts, Chad remains oblivious to Kevin's concerns. He's more focused on winning Kevin's approval and friendship. "Man, we used to have some wild times, remember when we shot fireworks by the lake and got totally hammered?" Chad reminisces, his eyes misty with nostalgia. Kevin, preoccupied with finding Zion, responds absentmindedly, "Uh, no, I don't remember that."
