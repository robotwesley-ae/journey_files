continue the sequence with the most efficient version of the following ideas of how they make it to the bottom, make sure the have the ferris wheel stop at every pod-------------------- Linda's Unfortunate Leap: Having weighed their options, Chad decides to go first. He carefully positions himself, then leaps to the next pod, landing safely. He signals for the others to follow. As Linda jumps, a gust of wind throws her off balance. She scrambles desperately to grasp something, but to the utter shock of her companions, she plunges into the darkness below. Both Kevin and Chad are paralyzed for a moment, grappling with the horror of what just happened. Chad's Mechanical Misjudgment: Trying to stay focused, Chad spies the Ferris wheel's large counterweight pulley system. Disregarding Kevin's frantic warnings, he leaps onto the counterweight, hoping to slide down. However, the mechanism wasn’t designed for such a sudden weight increase. With a grinding noise and a snap, the counterweight jerks before catapulting Chad away, sending him flying against the festival backdrop before he vanishes amidst the tents below. Kevin's Loneliness and Determination: With his companions seemingly gone, Kevin is engulfed in a profound sense of isolation. But he's now more determined than ever to find a safe way down. Spotting a giant teddy bear in a lower pod, he hatches a plan to use it as a makeshift cushion for his descent. The Beam Walk: Kevin cautiously proceeds along the Ferris wheel’s central beam, leading directly to the teddy bear's pod. Every step is carefully placed, with the harrowing memories of his friends' fates urging him to be meticulous. The Teddy Bear Stunt: Reaching the teddy bear's pod, Kevin swiftly negotiates with the bear's hesitant owner, eventually offering money to secure the fluffy lifesaver. With the teddy bear tightly embraced, Kevin positions himself and leaps off the Ferris wheel. As he nears the ground, he twists mid-air, landing hard on his back with the teddy bear cushioning his fall, absorbing the impact. Ground Reality: Kevin lies winded but intact, staring up at the night sky, still clutching the teddy bear. Just as he starts to process the magnitude of his ordeal, a disheveled Chad, remnants of a festival tent wrapped around him, stumbles over, laughing about his wild descent. To their astonishment, Linda soon joins them, having miraculously landed in an inflatable festival installation. The trio, against all expectations, finds themselves together again, each with their own wild tale of descent. --- Spotting The Teddy Bear: From this new vantage point, Kevin spots a giant teddy bear in a pod further below. An idea forms: could they use it as a cushion for a potentially safer descent? But first, they need to get to it. The Beam Walk: With the central beam structure of the Ferris wheel being the most direct route to the teddy bear, Kevin suggests they attempt walking on it. He goes first, steadily placing one foot in front of the other, like a tightrope walker. Linda and Chad follow suit, using the pod's structure for balance. Near Mishap: While navigating a particularly narrow section, Linda loses her balance and slips, once again finding herself dangling perilously. Kevin and Chad rush to her aid, clutching onto the beam with one hand and grabbing Linda with the other. The Final Leap: Reaching the pod with the giant teddy bear, Kevin, remembering his original idea, grabs the stuffed animal. After ensuring it's securely under his arm, he positions himself for the daring jump to the ground. Using the teddy bear to break his fall, Kevin lands with a jarring but non-injurious thud.

Spotting the Teddy Bear:
From a pod above, Kevin spots a giant teddy bear in a pod below.
KEVIN (excitedly) Look! That teddy bear... it could be our ticket down!
LINDA (nervously) You can't be serious...
CHAD (pondering) He's onto something. We use the stops at each pod to get closer to it.
