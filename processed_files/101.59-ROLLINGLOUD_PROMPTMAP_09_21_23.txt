That's a great idea! Here's a possible rewrite:
Kevin decides to try out the vegan food truck, but it doesn't sit well with his stomach. He rushes to the nearest port-a-potty, only to find that it's already occupied by Chad.
As Kevin is taking care of business, a group of mischievous festival-goers decides to play a prank on him and lock him in the port-a-potty. Chad, not wanting to be left out of the fun, decides to lock himself in the one next to Kevin.
As they start to feel the effects of the bad food, Kevin and Chad realize that they're trapped. The port-a-potty is disgusting, and the smell is overwhelming. They try to call for help, but their phones are dead.
As time passes, their situation becomes more dire. They're both horribly sick and need to get out of the port-a-potty before things get even worse. But the pranksters are nowhere to be found, and they're running out of options.
With no other choice, Kevin and Chad decide to take matters into their own hands. They use the limited tools at their disposal to try to break free from the port-a-potties. It's a messy and disgusting process, but they're determined to get out.
Finally, after what feels like hours, they manage to escape. Covered in filth and sick to their stomachs, they stumble out of the port-a-potties, drawing a crowd of horrified festival-goers.
Despite the embarrassment and discomfort, Kevin and Chad can't help but laugh at the absurdity of their situation. It's just another crazy moment in a wild and unpredictable festival experience.

Kevin and Chad should have chowed down on the vegan food from the truck earlier, because they had a horrible case of munchies. Their stomachs should be hit at the exact same time and they should rush to side by side portapotties
