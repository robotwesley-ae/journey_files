Okay. So here is the last bit that we have "As they approach the VIP entrance, the Snap Girls are nowhere to be found. Kevin and Chad plead with security to let them in, but to no avail. Frustration mounting, Kevin searches for a solution. Suddenly, Chad suggests creating a distraction. Without hesitation, Chad grabs a glow stick and shoves it up his butt, then takes off running around the entrance, screaming and laughing maniacally. The security guards are distracted by Chad's bizarre antics, and Kevin seizes the opportunity to sneak into VIP. As he looks around VIP, trying to spot Zion or any clues, he quickly becomes overwhelmed by the chaos. Feeling lost and alone, Kevin slinks off to the side, hoping for a stroke of luck. Suddenly, he feels a tap on his shoulder. He turns around to see Shenseea â€“ the Jamaican artist from earlier, a mischievous grin on her face. Shenseea takes one look at Jeremy's Rolling Loud outfit and bursts out laughing. She can't contain her amusement and starts taking pictures of him, asking if this is his first festival. As she's snapping away, a group of her friends join in, pointing and laughing at Jeremy's outfit. Jeremy is mortified, but also can't help but laugh at the ridiculousness of the situation. He tries to play it off, but the teasing from Shenseea and her friends only gets worse." We now need Kevin to do something dumb and funny to get him taken away to jail with Chad as the low point.
