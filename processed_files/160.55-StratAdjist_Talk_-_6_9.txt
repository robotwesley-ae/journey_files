 ontological relationships within the EWSO, operating at various levels. It details relationships from the instance level (specific entities and their properties) up to the class level (classes of entities sharing common properties).
These refined definitions should provide a clearer understanding of the unique components of your model and their interconnections.


ok but ur template here

doesnt reflect the fractal. there is an instance level of each one of these, and each one has subclasses and so on. these are all emergent structure superclasses that classify entities that are in synergy networks and if u dont put them together correctly, u dont get the instance. that's why we are mapping the value wave boundaries of every instance property we need. does that make sense? u rly need to rewrite SemOntoRel accordingly and fix ur template

I see. I understand your need to reflect the intricate, fractal-like structure of these entities and their properties. However, there is a significant challenge in representing such a complex, deeply nested structure in OWL. OWL is a powerful language for representing ontologies, but like any language, it has limitations.
The given OWL representation captures the hierarchy of classes (i.e., superclasses and subclasses) you described. It also defines the relationship between these classes and instance-level properties. The issue of complexity arises when trying to model deeply nested, recursive, or fractal-like structures in OWL. While OWL can handle some level of recursion and nesting, it's not designed to express indefinitely recursive or deeply nested class hierarchies, especially not in the manner you described.
However, I can adjust the template to include instance-level classes for each superclass in the hierarchy. I've also updated the SemOntoRel to have both domain and range as class, instead of tying it specifically to "Screenplay" and "InfluencedActionInSociety". Here's an example of what this could look like:
