The laughter dies. Carti's amusement fades, replaced by seriousness.

PLAYBOI CARTI
What's your son look like?

KEVIN
Let me show you...

Kevin pulls out his phone to find a photo of Zion, but accidentally opens a risqué text from earlier.

PLAYBOI CARTI
(laughs)
Damn, Kev.

Flustered, Kevin quickly scrolls past the photo.

KEVIN
(mumbling)
That's, um, not...

He finds a picture of Zion and shows Carti.

INSERT SHOT - A PHOTO OF KEVIN AND A YOUNGER ZION.

KEVIN
That's Zion...

Carti shakes his head.

PLAYBOI CARTI
No Zion here, man.

Kevin's heart plummets. His plan has failed, but he's earned some respect from the bus occupants. His phone rings - the caller ID shows "MELANIE - WIFE". He moves to decline the call.

KEVIN
(muttering)
Can't do this now...

PLAYBOI CARTI
(smirking)
Always answer the wife, Kev.

Kevin sighs and answers the call.

MELANIE (V.O.)
(frustrated)
Kevin, I'm parking the car and heading to the entrance. Where are you? Where's Zion?

Kevin's anxiety heightens. He quickly ends the call, his situation feeling insurmountable.

write the following into FDX in the style of Todd Phillips: Meanwhile, Chad and Linda experience their own all-is-lost moment as they sit in festival jail, holding hands tightly. Chad winces in pain, the glow stick lodged uncomfortably in his anus. Linda strokes his hair, trying to soothe him, but they both know they need medical attention. Despite their pleas for help, the festival staff seems to have abandoned them. Frustrated and desperate, Linda decides to take matters into her own hands. With gloves on, she carefully tries to remove the glow stick. Chad cries out in pain, but also some pleasure mixed in. Suddenly, with a loud snap, the glow stick breaks in half, and the glowing gel oozes into Chad's anus. Linda's face turns pale with horror. Chad “What just happened?”

INT. FESTIVAL JAIL - CONTINUOUS

Chad and Linda huddle together in festival jail, their hands entwined tightly. Chad grimaces, the glow stick lodged in an awkward position causing him obvious discomfort. Linda gently strokes his hair, a futile attempt to comfort him in their shared predicament.

CHAD
(groaning)
This is the worst...

LINDA
(nervously)
We'll get help, Chad.

Despite their pleas, the festival staff seems oblivious to their predicament. Linda looks around, her frustration mounting.

LINDA
(resolute)
Alright, I'm doing this myself.

Slipping on a pair of gloves, she cautiously approaches Chad. He yelps as she attempts to remove the glow stick, his cries mingling with a bizarre hint of pleasure.

CHAD
(wincing)
Ow! But...also...

Suddenly, with a sickening SNAP, the glow stick breaks in half. A luminescent goo spills forth, oozing into Chad's nether regions. Linda's face pales in horror.

CHAD
(panicked)
What just happened?!

write the following into FDX in the style of Todd Phillips: Kevin's inspiration: While on Playboi Carti's Playbus, Kevin learns that Carti is friends with the festival's head of security. Realizing that the head of security could not only get Chad and Linda out of festival jail but also provide access to the security cameras to help locate Zion, Kevin convinces Carti to introduce him to his friend. Carti's connection: Carti introduces Kevin to the head of security, who agrees to help. The security head releases Chad and Linda from the festival jail and arranges for Kevin, Chad, Linda, and Shenseea to use the security control room to scan the festival grounds for any sign of Zion.

KEVIN
(excited)
Carti, did you just say you're friends with the head of security?

PLAYBOI CARTI
(nodding)
Yeah, me and Don go way back.

KEVIN
(pleading)
Carti, I need your help. My friends are in festival jail and my son... I need to find my son.

Playboi Carti studies Kevin for a moment, then gives a resigned shrug.

PLAYBOI CARTI
(reluctant)
Alright, man. Let's go find Don.
