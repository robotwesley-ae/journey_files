understand how the customer is interacting with the offers. it leverages the ADHD trigger cycle (exploitation of current resource vs foraging for new better one) via creating gold rush atmosphere out of abundant exchange (framing the transaction as a massive win win for everyone). this unlocks peoples' stupidity and makes them forego current behavior patterns in favor of the promise of better ones they develop for themselves on the basis of having a map to better resources that only appear if they learn how to create the resource that triggers ADHD cycles. So the value ladder leverages this ADHD cycle in order to make people courageous enough to go and search for the new resource, but also gives them a map to it (via the products in the offers, usually) so that when they encounter the new resource, they wont lose the pokemon battle to make it theirs (they will overcome the obstacle) and then return to the value ladder looking for the next step. Because the value ladder is proven to work, because the person who sold it to the customer also did it themselves before to find out about it
