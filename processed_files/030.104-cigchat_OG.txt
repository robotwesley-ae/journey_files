Expert 3 (Dr. Green, Computer Science & Knowledge Representation and Reasoning): Exactly. We should aim to define a glossary of terms that GPT can associate with the InstanceProperty-PropertyValue->ClassLevel.InstanceProperty-Property.SpectrumConceptualBoundary relationship. We would use this glossary to create prompts that guide GPT to generate outputs reflecting these relationships.
Expert 4 (Dr. Blue, Ontology & Computer Science): Yes, our task is to create a glossary of custom defined EWSO terms that we can use to generate the appropriate prompts. These prompts should guide GPT to generate outputs that accurately reflect the relationships defined by the EWSO framework.
Round 2:
Expert 1 (Dr. Brown, Combinatorics & Computer Science): One possible approach could be to create prompts that ask GPT to generate InstanceProperty-PropertyValue pairs for a given instance. We could then abstract these pairs to the ClassLevel, asking GPT to generate a conceptual boundary for the property values.
Expert 2 (Dr. White, Artificial Intelligence & Knowledge Representation and Reasoning): We can further refine this by creating prompts that guide GPT to generate responses that highlight the relationships between different InstanceProperties and their values at both the instance and class levels.
Expert 3 (Dr. Green, Computer Science & Knowledge Representation and Reasoning): Alongside this, we should also create prompts that ask GPT to identify and describe the semantic and ontological relationships that exist between different instance properties and their values.
Expert 4 (Dr. Blue, Ontology & Computer Science): Finally, we should collate these ideas into a comprehensive glossary of EWSO terms. This glossary will serve as a guide for creating prompts that instruct GPT to generate outputs adhering to the EWSO framework.
Yes friends. But realize that the terms i used there  "InstanceProperty-PropertyValue->ClassLevel.InstanceProperty-Property.SpectrumConceptualBoundary" are a gloss, an example, and not the true terminology that GPT understands. That's why we need to devise the best way to find out what it is. That is what is necessary right now. Please continue

Round 1:
Expert 1 (Dr. Brown, Combinatorics & Computer Science): In order to align our language with GPT, we need to identify how GPT interprets OWL-like terminology. A starting point could be generating sample prompts around OWL principles and studying the generated responses.
Expert 2 (Dr. White, Artificial Intelligence & Knowledge Representation and Reasoning): Agreed. We can evaluate GPT's responses to understand how it processes and generates outputs related to OWL constructs.
Expert 3 (Dr. Green, Computer Science & Knowledge Representation and Reasoning): This process could also help us in creating the custom-defined EWSO terminology. Based on GPT's comprehension and representation of OWL constructs, we can map our desired concepts onto the constructs that GPT understands.
Expert 4 (Dr. Blue, Ontology & Computer Science): In this process, it's crucial to keep in mind the original goal: to formulate the InstanceProperty-PropertyValue->ClassLevel.InstanceProperty-Property.SpectrumConceptualBoundary relationship. Every term in the custom-defined EWSO terminology should aid in constructing or understanding this relationship.
Round 2:
Expert 1 (Dr. Brown, Combinatorics & Computer Science): To facilitate the wide searchlight approach, we should attempt different types of OWL-related prompts and explore GPT's responses.
Expert 2 (Dr. White, Artificial Intelligence & Knowledge Representation and Reasoning): Sherlock Holmes-style, we can dissect these responses to understand the underlying OWL constructs GPT is using and how it is mapping those constructs to generate the responses.
Expert 3 (Dr. Green, Computer Science & Knowledge Representation and Reasoning): At the same time, we can examine the mathematical and logical coherence of GPT's responses to these prompts. This can help ensure that our custom-defined EWSO terminology will yield logical and coherent responses when used as prompts.
