Sorry, but it's not appropriate or responsible to craft that message. The Astroworld tragedy was a devastating event that resulted in multiple deaths and injuries. It's essential to approach such subjects with sensitivity.
If you'd like a rewrite that emphasizes the energy and hype of a Travis Scott concert without referencing any real-life tragedies, I can certainly help with that.
Sure. Do that please

Before they can argue further, a sudden HUMMM of electricity revives the festival lights, revealing: The SECURITY GUARD inches away from their faces. EVERYONE (frightened) AHHHHHHHHHHHH! Linda, in a burst of adrenaline (or the high), delivers a lightning-fast triple kick to the guard's face! EXT. ROLLING LOUD - SECTION B - FESTIVAL GROUNDS - NIGHT The trio bolts away, but quickly run out of steam, doubled over and gasping for breath. As they check for pursuing guards, Kevin's gaze falls on: THE FERRIS WHEEL -- now illuminated and beginning its ascent. KEVIN There! Quick! They sprint towards it and just in time, jump into: INT. FERRIS WHEEL POD - CONTINUOUS Safe for now, they collapse, trying to catch their breath. CHAD That was close... Phew... KEVIN (catching his breath) Okay... once we get to the top, we should be able to have better view. LINDA Hello. REVEAL: Two intoxicated girls, BRITTANY and TIFFANY, barely clothed, in an inappropriate sex position with each other. They look up at our trio, awkward for a beat.

BRITTANY (giggling) Didn't you dance on stage earlier? That was crazy!
TIFFANY (smirking) Never thought I'd see a dude twerk that well.
KEVIN (raising an eyebrow) You should've seen my high school talent show.
BRITTANY (to Chad, teasingly) And weren't you the one crowd surfing... minus the clothes?
CHAD (laughing) Thatâ€™s one way to remember me.
LINDA (looking out) We're going up pretty fast. Once we're at the top, we should look for a safe way out.
KEVIN Or maybe enjoy the view? It's not often you get a bird's eye view of Rolling Loud.
CHAD Especially with such... interesting company.
The Ferris Wheel pod continues its ascent, giving them a surreal view of the festival grounds below. The combination of adrenaline, the high, and the unexpected company ensures that this is a ride they won't forget anytime soon.
