To implement your proposed decentralized identity system using the EWSO framework and blockchain, we need to consider various key components and challenges:

1. Data Encryption and Decryption:
   - Develop encryption algorithms that utilize individuals' life stories, hopes, fears, trauma, and dreams as the basis for generating encrypted avatars or digital identities.
   - Design decryption mechanisms that utilize pain points and aspirations as the keys to decrypt these avatars and reveal the real identities behind them.

2. Blockchain Infrastructure:
   - Choose a suitable blockchain platform that aligns with the scalability, privacy, and security requirements of the decentralized identity system.
   - Determine the consensus mechanism, such as Proof-of-Work (PoW) or Proof-of-Stake (PoS), that best suits the network's objectives and desired network security.

3. Smart Contract Design:
   - Develop smart contracts that govern the encryption, decryption, and validation processes within the blockchain network.
   - Design incentive mechanisms within the smart contracts to motivate and reward problem solvers who contribute to solving blocks.

4. Validation and Verification:
   - Establish protocols and algorithms for validating the authenticity and accuracy of reported pain points and aspirations.
   - Implement reputation systems or consensus mechanisms to ensure that problem solvers are reliable and trustworthy.

5. User Experience and Interface:
   - Create user-friendly interfaces and applications that allow individuals to securely participate in the encrypted identity system.
   - Prioritize user experience to enhance adoption and ensure seamless interaction with the blockchain network.

6. Governance and Regulatory Compliance:
   - Consider applicable legal and regulatory frameworks regarding data privacy, consent, and protection.
   - Establish governance structures to manage the decentralized identity system and address potential disputes or conflicts.

7. Scalability and Performance:
   - Conduct thorough testing and optimization to ensure that the blockchain network is scalable, performs efficiently, and can handle a growing number of participants and transactions.

8. Community Engagement and Adoption:
   - Develop strategies to educate and engage potential users about the benefits, value proposition, and security aspects of the decentralized identity system.
   - Foster partnerships and collaborations with organizations that can support and promote the adoption of the system.

These are some of the key considerations to take into account during the implementation and feasibility assessment of your proposed decentralized identity system. Each aspect requires careful planning, technical expertise, and the collaboration of a multidisciplinary team.

Remember, with determination and systematic execution, we shall work towards transforming your vision into a practical, achievable reality. Together, we shall overcome obstacles and strive for excellence in implementing this groundbreaking decentralized identity system. ðŸŒˆ






No no no... we can just have everything about EWSO happen in text and be uploaded as a kind of cryptographic code in a file. We dont even need hashes. We are not trying to make it complicated to solve. It's just that it only GETS solved by: sending pings to all the people involved, and if enough people agree, the project is greenlit, and if not, then it reshuffles the people back into a superposition bc they are not posed in a project from a solved block yet






Ah, I see. You prefer a simplified approach to the implementation of the EWSO framework within the blockchain-based decentralized identity system. Here's a revised understanding of your proposal:

1. Text-based Encoding: Instead of complex cryptographic encryption and decryption mechanisms, the EWSO framework's information can be stored in text form within a file. This file acts as a repository of individual's life stories, hopes, fears, trauma, dreams, and other relevant data.
