[SemOntoChain]:{
Properties:{
Interconnectivity: Each node in the chain is connected to one or more nodes, facilitating a smooth flow of semantic information.
Hierarchical Structure: Nodes are arranged in a hierarchical manner, with broader concepts at the top and more specific ones below.
Dynamic Adaptability: The chain can evolve over time, adapting to new knowledge and requirements.
Markov Boundaries: The chain respects specific KRR (Knowledge Representation and Reasoning) boundaries, filtering out irrelevant information.
Transparency: Every node and connection is labeled and defined, making the ontology easily interpretable.
Context-Sensitivity: The chain is sensitive to the context in which it is applied, allowing for more accurate and meaningful outputs.
Multi-Domain Compatibility: Though primarily rooted in Onto-Math and Systems Relationships, it can incorporate elements from secondary and tertiary domains.}

Components:{
Primary Nodes: Core concepts from the field of Onto-Math, such as Set Theory, Predicate Logic, and Formal Semantics.

1.1 Sub-Nodes: Specific theories or models within each core concept.
Secondary Nodes: Supporting concepts from Systems Relationships, like AI Architecture, Dual Space, and Emergence.

2.1 Sub-Nodes: Components and properties related to each supporting concept.
Edges: Relationships between nodes, indicating the type of connection (e.g., "is-a," "part-of," "related-to").

Annotations: ${Explanatory notes or metadata attached to nodes and edges for better understanding and interpretation}.

Control Points: ${Nodes where the flow can be diverted or influenced, providing dynamic adaptability}.

Input/Output Gates: ${These are the entry and exit points of the chain, where the semantic information is ingested and the output is generated}.

Validation Layers: ${These are `${reasoning}` checkpoints within the chain to ensure that the information aligns with the intended semantic meaning and KRR boundaries}.
