As Jeremy talks, he glances over at Chad, who is chatting up one of the girls. He tries to make it look like he's keeping an eye on Zion in the background, but he's actually scanning the crowd, looking for any sign of his son.
His wife starts to ask him more questions, and Jeremy starts to sweat. He doesn't want to admit that he's lost sight of Zion, so he tries to skirt around the issue, telling her vague details about what they're doing and who they're with.
As he's talking, he feels a tap on his shoulder. He turns around to see a festival employee, holding Zion's hand. "Is this your son?" the employee asks.
Jeremy's heart leaps with relief, and he quickly tells his wife that he has to go. "Zion's back, everything's okay," he says before hanging up.
He turns to the festival employee and gives Zion a big hug. "Where were you?" he asks.
"I was just exploring," Zion says, grinning.
Jeremy takes a deep breath and tries to keep his cool, but he can't help feeling a little annoyed. "You had me worried sick," he says.
Zion just shrugs. "I'm fine, Dad. I just wanted to have some fun."
Jeremy can't help but smile. Despite everything, he's glad that Zion is safe and having a good time.

Once they're done, the girls start taking silly photos of themselves and sending them to Jeremy. He can't help but chuckle at their antics and starts to feel a little more relaxed, despite the fact that he's still worried about finding Zion.
As the girls continue to snap pictures, Jeremy notices something strange. Among the silly selfies, there are a few messages from Zion that he must have sent when the phone had briefly picked up reception. One of them says "Dad, I'm okay. I'm by the main stage." Jeremy's heart leaps with joy at the message, and he quickly shows it to Chad.
"We have to go to the main stage!" he exclaims.
Chad nods in agreement, and they quickly finish their drinks and say goodbye to the girls. Jeremy feels a sense of relief as they make their way through the crowds towards the main stage, feeling like they're finally getting closer to finding Zion.
