Funnel Composition Logic

Funnel Stages: Each funnel follows the same general flow of Awareness → Interest → Engagement → Action → Conversion → Ascension, but the specific steps and strategies used can vary greatly based on the type of funnel and the goals of the marketer.

Funnel Composition: The specific composition of the funnel (i.e., the combination of different types of funnels) should be tailored to the needs of the business and the behavior of the target audience. For example, a business targeting a younger audience might focus more on social media and content funnels, while a B2B business might focus more on email and direct sales funnels.

Sequential Funnels: Some funnels are meant to feed into others. For example, a content funnel might lead into an email funnel, with the goal of the content funnel being to generate leads for the email funnel.
