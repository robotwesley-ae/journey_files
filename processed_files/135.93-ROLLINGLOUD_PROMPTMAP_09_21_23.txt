INT. PLAYBUS - CONTINUOUS The PLAYBUS is a pulsating haze. Marijuana mist swirls (the bus has been rigged to be a giant hotbox) KEVIN, SHENSEEA, and KEESHALOO push through the bodies towards PLAYBOI CARTI, engrossed in his track. KEVIN (nervously) Uh, hello, Mr. Carti. My name's Kevin. I'm... a big fan of yours. Carti raises an eyebrow, his curiosity piqued yet skeptical. PLAYBOI CARTI Oh, really? So, what's your favorite track of mine? KEVIN (immediately) Sky. It's Sky. Carti looks surprised, a grin spreading across his face. PLAYBOI CARTI (leans back, crossing arms) Alright then, let's hear it. KEVIN You want to hear it? Like play it on an iphone? PLAYBOI CARTI I want you to sing your favorite song if you’re such a big fan. Heart pounding, Kevin takes a deep breath and launches into the first verse of "Sky", his voice shaky yet sincere. KEVIN (singing, unsteady) I told my boy go on, like ten flats on the fifty-yard...Yeah, yeah, off the fifty, yeah, yeah... A chorus of laughter erupts, but Kevin pushes through, refusing to back down. PLAYBOI CARTI (laughs) Nah, man. You ain't a fan. Faced with Carti's disbelief, Kevin comes clean, his words rushing out in a desperate confession. KEVIN (determined) You're right. I'm not a fan, not really. I actually don’t love your music, but I love my son and he loves your music, so I brought him to Rolling Loud thinking we’d watch you perform tonight and I secretly learned all the words to Sky, because I thought I’d surprise him, but now I lost him. And someone mentioned he might have come looking for you, for a photo... The laughter dies down. Carti's amusement fades. PLAYBOI CARTI What does Zion look like? KEVIN Here. Kevin reaches for his phone to show Playboi a photo of Zion, but in his haste, he opens a risqué text from the two girls he met earlier. PLAYBOI CARTI (laughs) Damn, bro. Flustered, Kevin scrolls past the photo. KEVIN (muttering) That's uh, something else... Playboi Carti gives a nod of understanding. PLAYBOI CARTI I get it. KEVIN Here. Here’s me and Zion. INSERT SHOT - A HEARTFELT PHOTO OF KEVIN AND ZION KEVIN This is when he was younger. Hold on... I can get a... here you go. Playboi gives an unsatisfactory shake of his head. PLAYBOI CARTI Man, I ain't seen no Zion here. Kevin's heart sinks. His attempts have yielded nothing, but it's clear the group is now rooting for him. Kevin's phone rings - it's his wife, Melanie. Kevin hesitates, then swipes to ignore the call. KEVIN I can't answer right now. PLAYBOI CARTI (grinning) You gotta pick up for the wife, bro. Trust me. Pressured, Kevin answers the call. Feeling pressured, Kevin answers the call, and his wife tells him she's parking and walking towards the entrance. He quickly ends the call, feeling even more stressed than before. Kevin's heart sinks, his hopes shattered. / rewrite the above but get into the phone call at the end and let's hear melanie's dailogue

INT. PLAYBUS - CONTINUOUS

The PLAYBUS throbs with energy. An artificial fog of marijuana mist swirls. Kevin, Shenseea, and Keeshaloo navigate towards PLAYBOI CARTI, absorbed in his track. 

KEVIN
(nervously)
Hi... Mr. Carti. I'm Kevin. And I'm... I'm a big fan.

Carti's eyebrow arches, curiosity mixed with skepticism.

PLAYBOI CARTI
Yeah? What's your favorite song then?

KEVIN
(quickly)
Sky. Definitely Sky.

Carti looks surprised, his lips stretching into a grin.

PLAYBOI CARTI
(leans back, arms crossed)
So, sing it.

KEVIN
You mean... play it on my phone?

PLAYBOI CARTI
No, I want you to sing it. 

Kevin's heart hammers as he inhales, starting the first verse of "Sky", his voice unsteady but earnest.

KEVIN
(singing, trembling)
I told my boy go on, like ten flats on the fifty-yard...Yeah, yeah, off the fifty, yeah, yeah...

Laughter breaks out, but Kevin doesn't back down, finishing the verse. 

PLAYBOI CARTI
(laughs)
Man, you ain't a fan.

Confronted, Kevin admits the truth.

KEVIN
(frustrated)
You're right. I'm not. But my son is. He adores your music, so I learned Sky to surprise him at your show tonight, but I lost him. Someone said he might have come looking for you...
