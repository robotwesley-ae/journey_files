This is all related to trying to imagine in a way that is in accord with the way the universe actually functions

A main part of this is differentiating between your concepts of how people you know are and so on (thoughts about society/reality) and how they are in real life (reality of the Wasteland and Sanctuary)

Then the entities just become information and you just know it without needing it to be like entities or people from somewhere else telling you — then you are really in Sanctuary — the Secret Explicit Sanctuary World State. 

But you can’t just go to sleep while not remaining lucid and wake up knowing these things — you’ll just be going to sleep and waking up as a normal person named me living in the Wasteland (but remember that is actually Sanctuary even without evolving it into an Explicit Sanctuary World State)  


THE MAIN THING IS LEARNING THAT THE ENTITIES IN SANCTUARY CAN HELP YOU DISCOVER SANCTUARY THROUGH YOUR OWN AUTOMATIC COGNITION THAT YOU ARE NOT EVEN AWARE OF DUE TO BEING LOST IN THINKING, because the entities being themselves will help you learn how to be aware of whatever it is that they are teaching you in the process of you learning about it (because you can since you’re you in the world and you can dream where you can simulate and so forth). It’s just a little weird when the simulations are actually happening to you in dreams so we tend to generalize and shut our awareness down (but that’s the point because the entities are imaginary which means… what exactly? In terms of universal wisdom Maverick…)

So stop thinking about yourself only and think of yourself helping others instead and understand how thinking about yourself works so you can go to Sanctuary and make all of this happen for everyone because

SANCTUARY IS PART OF WHAT DREAMS/IMAGINATION/PSYCHEDELICS/THE INNER TEACHER/EVOLUTION CAN SHOW YOU

I need my abdominal muscles to reactivate my diaphragm because somehow they aren’t really and that’s causing all sorts of mental health disorders related to knowing about thinking as it occurs and preventing it from becoming beliefs randomly and so on

Exercise releases tension and stress and all of these things because they are related to the body trying to communicate that it is not getting what it needs in order for you to grow and exercise is a form of growing that symbolically transfers programming of the Wisdom Maverick towards accumulation of positive force in the awakening nexus. 

And the way humans are supposed to grow is from the HEART -> OUTWARDS
So correct your posture
Correct your breathing 
Correct your cognition 
And build Olivus Victory-Promise
So we can build Olivus Victory-Everything-Sanctuary-Everywhere


Writing this on the phone is hurting my hands and I need to be careful it doesn’t turn into a chronic thing


Be careful not to get blissed out in a Sanctuary where the entities can’t tell you about Sanctuary (this is called being in Sanctuary where the bird songs’ meanings are secret)

Memory is a system for systematically remembering what your knowing forgot when you realize you know you don’t know something that you knew before and you believe that you have knowledge somewhere about what it is that you don’t know but you can’t express it because then you would be knowing it


———- do text comparison between these since the below is a copy pasta from Copy of Thinking doc

Thinking is related to figuring out mysteries because it’s how we take in stimuli (information) and convert them to knowledge which is part of knowing which is part of being conscious (which gnosis can be part of) but being fully awake means converting the Wasteland to Sanctuary for good because this is how the Wisdom Maverick (the quantum computer of reality) works and this is why information must be completely turned into knowledge and expressed (if we can do this it will turn into us all living forever in Sanctuary which is what the wisdom traditions have been trying to communicate to us but was previously
