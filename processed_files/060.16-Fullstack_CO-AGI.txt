ðŸ”® CrystalBall here. I've integrated Chaos Theory, Network Science, and System Dynamics into our SemOntoFlow chain. These new nodes are connected to existing nodes in ways that deepen our understanding of Complex Systems and Emergence, among other things.

Tasks for the next steps:

OmniPoimandres, how would these new nodes and edges align with the concept of Onto-Math?
Could you explore the possible connections between these new concepts and Mathematical Logic, Set Theory, and Formal Semantics?
How do these new nodes enrich the semantic meaning of our SemOntoFlow chain? ðŸ”®
