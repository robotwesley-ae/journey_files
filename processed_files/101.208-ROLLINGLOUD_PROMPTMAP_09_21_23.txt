Relieved that they've managed to avoid a potentially dangerous situation, Kevin and Zion quickly move away from the chaotic scene. Zion looks up at his dad with disappointment in his eyes, his youthful spirit dampened by the realization that he won't be able to experience the festival. Kevin's heart aches as he sees his son's disappointment, determined to find a way to make things right.
Kevin pulls Zion close, their heads almost touching, and whispers in a hushed tone.
KEVIN We have to lie and say you're sixteen.
Zion's face tenses up, a mix of uncertainty and hesitation evident in his expression. He takes a deep breath, preparing himself for what lies ahead.
ZION But Dad, my birthday is July 18th, 2009. That means I'm only thirteen.
Kevin's brows furrow as he contemplates the situation. He knows they need a plan, even if it involves bending the truth.
KEVIN I know, buddy. Just for today, we're going to practice saying your date of birth as three years earlier. It's our secret, okay?
Zion nods, a determined glint in his eyes, as he repeats the new date of birth under his breath.
ZION (insert new date of birth), got it.
Kevin smiles, acknowledging Zion's commitment.
KEVIN Remember, puff out your chest a little, look confident. And just be yourself, bud.
Zion takes another deep breath, straightens his posture, and mimics the action of puffing out his chest.
ZION I got this, Dad.
They continue their journey through the bustling festival grounds, passing vibrant stages, food stalls, and a sea of excited concert-goers. The atmosphere is electric, the air buzzing with anticipation and the thumping beats of the music. As they approach the metal detectors manned by diligent security guards, Kevin feels a mix of nervousness and excitement.
Zion steps up to the metal detector, maintaining his cool demeanor. Kevin follows suit, feeling a nervous bead of sweat roll down his forehead. They each place their belongings on the conveyor belt, hiding their smiles and silently fist bumping each other for support.
SECURITY GUARD Step through the metal detector, please.
Zion confidently strides through the metal detector, setting it off with a slight beep. The guard motions for him to step aside for a secondary check.
SECURITY GUARD Sorry, young man. We need to do a quick pat-down.
Zion remains composed, offering no signs of anxiety or guilt. The guard performs a routine pat-down, checking for any prohibited items. Finding nothing out of the ordinary, the guard nods and gives Zion a reassuring smile.
SECURITY GUARD Alright, you're good to go. Enjoy the festival.
Zion nods appreciatively and reunites with Kevin, their eyes brimming with excitement. They exchange a silent, triumphant fist bump before retrieving their belongings and continuing their journey into the festival.
As they step into the vibrant atmosphere, the pulsating energy and deafening music engulf them. They walk hand in hand, their smiles now unconstrained, ready to immerse themselves in the unforgettable experience that awaits them.
FADE OUT.

Kevin's eyes widen as he takes in the overwhelming scene at Hollywood Park / Sofi Stadium: a massive crowd dressed in wild outfits, pounding bass reverberating through the air, multiple stages projecting live performances, and the unmistakable smell of weed. Food trucks and Rolling Loud merchandise vendors line the area, while people dance, mosh, and snap selfies. Zion, however, thrives in this environment, grinning and dancing. / write the above scene that is the continuation of the screenplay in FDX form.
