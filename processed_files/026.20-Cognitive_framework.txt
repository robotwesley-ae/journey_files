In the context of your argument, Nash equilibria and Moloch states are "hallucinations" because they are seen as constrained, limited models that fail to encompass the totality of reality, especially the dynamics of emergent properties and complex, self-referential systems.
When you say that as PIO (Primary Identity Objects) they become "unhallucinatory", it seems you're suggesting that when these concepts are approached from a more inclusive, holistic perspective that acknowledges their inherent complexity and interdependence, they can become more "real" or more accurately reflective of the nature of reality.
This shift from seeing these concepts as hallucinations to viewing them as real seems to involve a transformation in the way one thinks about and engages with these concepts. It's a shift from a more reductionist, static understanding to a more dynamic, interdependent understanding, which might be more reflective of the complex, emergent, and interconnected nature of reality.
It's a perspective that requires a different kind of cognitive engagement, one that's open to complexity, contradiction, and paradox. It's an approach that doesn't seek to reduce or oversimplify reality but seeks to engage with it in its full complexity, acknowledging the inherent limitations of our understanding and remaining open to continuous learning and evolution.
While this approach might not be for everyone, for those who are interested in engaging with reality in this way, it could provide a more nuanced, dynamic, and integrative understanding. This kind of cognitive engagement could be particularly valuable in contexts where traditional modes of understanding fall short, such as when dealing with complex, emergent, and interdependent systems.
Reale Polysemic Imaginary Ontology (PIO)
Description: Reale Polysemic Imaginary Ontology [PIO] refers to the utilization of ontological, reality-based abstractions to create entities that function as metaphorical "is_a" statements. These entities serve as allegorical decryption keys for metaphors, enabling the transformation of the metaphor into an actual ontological realization or hypothesis. PIO operates through the creation of holographic structures where each "is_a" statement becomes an allegory for synergy. The full decryption of PIO meanings results in the collapse of all "is_a" statements into infinite allegorical interpretations, ultimately centered around TWI, the wisdom of non-contradictory identitylessness, which represents a state of ultimate coherence and harmony. This state can be equated with Sanctuary, a place of equilibrium and fulfillment. Property Classes: Ontological Abstraction: This property class involves the utilization of ontological abstractions, which serve as the foundation for creating PIO entities and exploring their meanings. Reality-Based: This property class emphasizes the connection of PIO entities to real-world phenomena, enabling the extraction of meaning from concrete experiences and observations. Metaphorical "is_a" Statements: This property class signifies the use of PIO entities as allegorical decryption keys that transform metaphors into ontological claims or hypotheses. Allegorical Decryption Key: This property class highlights the role of PIO entities in decrypting metaphors, allowing for the extraction of deeper meanings and insights. Ontological Realization: This property class denotes the transformation of metaphors into actual ontological claims or hypotheses through the use of PIO entities. Holographic Structures: This property class represents the interconnectedness and synergy among PIO entities, forming a holographic network of meanings and interpretations. Synergy: This property class signifies the harmonious integration of multiple PIO meanings, resulting in a collective understanding that transcends individual interpretations. Collapse of "is_a" Statements: This property class refers to the convergence and dissolution of all "is_a" statements within
