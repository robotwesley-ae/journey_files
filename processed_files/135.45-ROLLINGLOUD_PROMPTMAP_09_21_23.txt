As Chad finishes his story, Jeremy's phone rings. It's a call from his wife, and she sounds upset. She tells him that she received a text from Zion, saying that he's fine and he's hanging out with some friends he made at the festival. He chose to stay with them and didn't want to be found. Jeremy is furious, feeling betrayed by his son and hurt that Zion would rather spend time with strangers than with him.
He storms off, determined to find Zion and bring him back. However, he's still a little drunk and high from earlier, and it's starting to affect his judgement. He stumbles around, asking people if they've seen his son, but he can barely string a sentence together. He accidentally bumps into a group of people, knocking over their drinks and causing a scene. They start shouting at him, and he realizes that he's not making things better.
Jeremy decides to take a break and sits down on a bench, trying to clear his head. But before he knows it, he's nodding off, and he almost falls off the bench. A group of festival-goers walk by, and they notice him slumped over. They take a picture of him and start laughing, making fun of the old guy who can't handle his liquor.
This wakes Jeremy up, and he feels embarrassed and ashamed. He's supposed to be a responsible father, but here he is, wasted and alone at a music festival. He gets up and starts walking, trying to find Zion again.
As he's walking, he sees a group of teenagers smoking something that smells suspiciously like weed. He's tempted to ask them if he can join, but he knows he shouldn't. He's already in enough trouble.
Finally, he sees a group of kids who look like they might be Zion's age. He approaches them and tries to strike up a conversation, but they just look at him funny and walk away. He feels defeated and lost, wondering if he'll ever find his son.
Just when he's about to give up, he sees Zion walking towards him, flanked by a group of teenagers. Jeremy is relieved but also angry. He confronts Zion, asking him how he could just run off like that without telling him. Zion just shrugs and says that he wanted to have some fun and meet new people.
Jeremy is about to yell at him, but he stops himself. He realizes that he's been too hard on Zion, and maybe he needs to let him make his own choices. He takes a deep breath and tells Zion that he's sorry, and he just wants him to be safe. They hug, and Jeremy feels a weight lifted off his shoulders.
