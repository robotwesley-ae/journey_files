Ontology, on the other hand, is a subfield of philosophy that deals with the nature of being, existence, and reality. Ontologies aim to provide a systematic account of the entities that exist, their relationships, and their properties. In the context of computer science and artificial intelligence, ontology refers to the formal representation of knowledge within a domain, which includes concepts, relationships, and their properties, typically represented in a machine-readable format.
While linguistics and ontology are separate fields, they are related in that language can be used to express ontological concepts, and understanding the structure and meaning of language can be valuable in developing clear and precise ontological representations. Some linguistic theories, such as formal semantics, aim to provide a formalization of meaning in natural language, which can be seen as an intersection between linguistics and ontology. However, ontology goes beyond linguistics in its focus on the nature of reality and the relationships between entities, while linguistics primarily concerns the properties and structure of language.


Computer science ontologies and linguistics, I meant. Since there is no SUCH THING as philosophical ontology without so-called computer science ontology.
In the context of computer science, ontologies and linguistics still maintain distinct characteristics, but their relationship becomes more intertwined.
Computer science ontologies are concerned with the formal representation of knowledge within a specific domain. They define concepts, relationships, and properties in a machine-readable format, facilitating communication, reasoning, and knowledge sharing between computer systems. Computer science ontologies can be seen as a way of expressing domain knowledge using structured, well-defined vocabularies.
Linguistics, in the context of computer science, often focuses on natural language processing (NLP) and computational linguistics. These fields explore how human languages can be analyzed, understood, and generated by computers. NLP techniques enable computers to process and interpret human language, allowing them to extract meaning, context, and sentiment from text or speech.
The relationship between computer science ontologies and linguistics is that both fields aim to represent and convey meaning. Computer science ontologies provide a structured, formalized means of representing knowledge, while linguistic techniques enable the processing and understanding of natural language. By combining the strengths of both fields, it is possible to develop more robust, intelligent systems that can understand and reason about the world using both formalized knowledge representations and natural language inputs.
However, they remain distinct in their focus: computer science ontologies concentrate on the structured representation of domain knowledge, while linguistics in computer science addresses the challenges of processing and understanding human languages.


Linguistics is a type of conveyance of meaning that is poor compared to ontology. Ontology is using  linguistics to make language convey meaning more clearly.
It's not necessarily accurate to say that linguistics is a poor conveyance of meaning compared to ontology. Instead, it's more precise to say that linguistics and ontology serve different purposes and have their unique strengths and weaknesses when it comes to conveying meaning.
Linguistics is the study of human language, including its structure, evolution, and usage. It encompasses various aspects of language, such as phonetics, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. Linguistics helps us understand how meaning is conveyed and interpreted in human communication.
Ontology, in the context of computer science, is a formal representation of knowledge within a specific domain. It defines concepts, relationships, and properties in a structured and machine-readable format. Ontology allows for a more explicit and unambiguous representation of knowledge, which can be useful for reasoning, knowledge sharing, and communication between computer systems.
