LINDA (excitedly) Okay, guys, listen up. We'll be using code 10-4 to indicate that we understand and acknowledge a message. If we hear code 10-13, that means we have a weather or road hazard. And if we hear code 10-20, that means we have a location update.
Kevin raises an eyebrow, clearly skeptical of the codes.
KEVIN Can't we just talk?
Linda's face lights up, eager to defend her chosen method of communication.
LINDA (indignant) But Kevin, using these codes will ensure precise and efficient communication! My teacher, Ms. Jenkins, was a lovely lady. She wore flowery dresses and always had a kind smile on her face. She taught me the importance of clear codes and how they can bring order to chaotic situations.
Chad chuckles, finding Linda's dedication amusing.
CHAD (teasing) Oh, Linda, I'm sure Ms. Jenkins was a saint. But let me tell you, my cousin Steve worked in law enforcement, and he shared some real insider knowledge about these codes. 10-4 actually means "affirmative," 10-13 is for "getting food," and 10-20? That's simply "meeting up."
Linda's eyes widen, a mixture of surprise and disbelief on her face.
LINDA (offended) Chad, how can you say that? Ms. Jenkins put so much effort into teaching me these codes. She even baked cookies for the whole class on our last day!
Chad's teasing smile softens, realizing he may have crossed a line.
CHAD (apologetic) Hey, Linda, I didn't mean to discredit Ms. Jenkins. I'm sure she's a wonderful teacher. But these codes just don't seem practical for our situation.
Linda's expression softens, but she still seems reluctant to let go of her beloved codes.
LINDA (reluctant) Fine, Chad. If you're not going to use the codes I presented, then give me my walkie-talkie back.
Linda reaches out her hand, her eyes filled with a mixture of disappointment and determination. Chad takes a deep breath, realizing the need for unity.
CHAD (sincere) Linda, Kevin's right. We're all here to find Zion. Let's put aside the codes and focus on open communication. We can trust our instincts and work together without the codes.
Kevin, seeing the tension between Linda and Chad, steps in to mediate.
KEVIN (calming) Guys, we're a team. Let's support each other, keep a clear mind, and find Zion together. We don't need codes. We just need to talk and trust in each other's abilities.
Linda and Chad look at each other, their disagreement slowly fading away. They realize that their shared goal is finding Zion, and unity is more important than codes.
LINDA (relenting) You're right, Kevin. Let's focus on finding Zion and rely on our instincts and open communication.
CHAD (nods) Agreed. Let's set aside the codes and work together as a team.
With newfound understanding and unity, Kevin, Linda, and Chad set off into the festival grounds, leaving behind the debate over codes. They rely on their intuition, clear communication, and unwavering determination to find Zion and bring him safely back home.
