Creating an instruction set (XYK) for the trading bot:
Development of the trading bot algorithm and integration with the strategy: 100-200 hours
Developer hourly rate: $50-$100
Subtotal: $5,000-$20,000
Software, processing, and infrastructure costs:
Trading strategy development tools and platforms (e.g., QuantConnect, MetaTrader): Commercial licenses ranging from $0 to $1,000+ per year, depending on the required features and support.
Cloud computing resources: $50 to $500 per month, depending on your requirements.
Model training and fine-tuning (if using GPT-4 for assisting in strategy development or other tasks): $500 to $5,000 for training and fine-tuning.
With these estimates, the total budget for the trading strategy project, including both human and non-human costs, could range from approximately $20,550 to $82,500. As before, these estimates are rough and could vary depending on the specific requirements, the choice of tools and platforms, and the extent of GPT-4 usage.

Remove the human costs if GPT can provide instructions for accomplishing the entire set of tasks step by step when prompted at each stage 

If we assume that GPT can provide instructions for accomplishing the entire set of tasks step by step when prompted at each stage, we can revise the budget estimates by removing the human costs. In this case, we'll focus on the software, processing, and infrastructure costs:

Software and tools costs:
Trading strategy development tools and platforms (e.g., QuantConnect, MetaTrader): Commercial licenses ranging from $0 to $1,000+ per year, depending on the required features and support.
Processing and infrastructure costs:
Cloud computing resources: $50 to $500 per month, depending on your requirements.
Model training and fine-tuning (if using GPT-4 for assisting in strategy development or other tasks): $500 to $5,000 for training and fine-tuning.
With these revised estimates, the total budget for the trading strategy project, focusing on non-human costs, could range from approximately $1,500 to $11,000 per year, depending on the choice of tools and platforms and the extent of GPT-4 usage. Keep in mind that, even with GPT-4 assistance, there might still be a need for human intervention to verify, validate, and fine-tune the instructions provided by the AI, which could potentially add human costs back into the budget.

You have to calculate the ontology alignment

My apologies for the oversight. In the context of the trading strategy project, aligning the optimal trading strategy (X) with the trading strategy domain (Y) would involve ontology alignment. Here's an estimate of the non-human costs for this part of the project:

Processing and infrastructure costs for ontology alignment:
Computing resources for ontology alignment algorithms: $50 to $500 per month, depending on the complexity of the ontologies and alignment algorithms.
Model training and fine-tuning (if using GPT-4 for assisting in ontology alignment tasks): $500 to $5,000 for training and fine-tuning.
With these estimates, the additional non-human costs for ontology alignment in the trading strategy project could range from approximately $1,500 to $11,000 per year, depending on the complexity of the alignment algorithms and the extent of GPT-4 usage.

Please note that these estimates are still rough and could vary depending on the specific requirements, the choice of tools and platforms, and the extent of GPT-4 usage. Additionally, human intervention might still be necessary to verify, validate, and fine-tune the alignment process, which could potentially add human costs back into the budget.

Right and then this strategy could be fed into a trading bot. Add that into the budget 

Incorporating the development and integration of a trading bot into the budget, we have the following additional non-human costs:

Software and tools costs:
Trading bot development tools and platforms (e.g., QuantConnect, MetaTrader): Commercial licenses ranging from $0 to $1,000+ per year, depending on the required features and support.
Processing and infrastructure costs:
