(anxiously)
Carti... we need to talk.

PLAYBOI CARTI
(interrupting his work)
What's so important to disturb the flow, man?

Kevin's gaze darts over the crowd again, searching, hoping. He takes a deep breath, ready to lay his desperation bare.

KEVIN
(voice trembling)
It's about my son... Zion.

INT. PLAYBUS - CONTINUOUS

The PLAYBUS is a pulsating haze. Marijuana mist swirls. KEVIN, SHENSEEA, and KEESHALOO push through the sea of bodies towards PLAYBOI CARTI, engrossed in his track. Kevin's panic is a living entity in his chest.

PLAYBOI CARTI 
(not looking up) 
Who's killing my vibe?

KEVIN
(desperate)
Carti... I need your help. 

CARTI 
(smirking)
Why should I care?

Kevin swallows, his throat dry, a bead of sweat trickling down his face.

KEVIN 
(stammering)
My... my son, Zion. He's lost. 

Carti pauses his music, his amusement replaced with curiosity as he turns to face Kevin.

Continue the scene in FDX with Kevin nervously claiming he's a Playboi Carti fan, Playboi Carti challenging him about what his favorite song is. Kevin actually knows the answer. Playboi asks him to sing it. Kevin tries to sing it and does an okay job. Playboi sees through Kevin's false claim and realizes that Kevin is not a real fan. Kevin comes clean and tells Playboi Carti that he want to surprise his son (Zion, 13) and learn the words to Zion's favorite song so that the two of them could've experienced Playboi's live performance together, but now that's Zion's lost at Rolling Loud, Kevin has no idea what to do and Kevin was told that Zion may have been trying to get a photo with Playboi Carti which is why Kevin is on interrupting Playboi's flow.

Kevin gulps, nerves getting the best of him.

KEVIN
(nervously)
I'm actually... a big fan of your work, Carti.

Playboi Carti raises an eyebrow, intrigued yet suspicious.

PLAYBOI CARTI
(smirking)
Really? What's your favorite song, then?

KEVIN
(quickly)
Sky. 

Carti is taken aback, but grins, a challenge in his eyes.

PLAYBOI CARTI
(leaning back)
Alright, let's hear it.

Kevin swallows, then, with a shaky voice, begins to sing a verse from "Sky". He does an okay job, but his nerves are clear.

Playboi Carti laughs, recognizing the awkwardness of the situation.

PLAYBOI CARTI
(laughs)
I don't buy it, man. You ain't no fan.

Kevin takes a deep breath, deciding to tell the truth.

KEVIN
(resolute)
You're right. I'm not a fan. It's actually my son, Zion. He loves your music. We were supposed to enjoy your performance together. I was learning the words to surprise him...

Kevin chokes back a sob, tears welling in his eyes.

KEVIN
(voice breaking)
But now he's lost, and I heard he might've tried to find you for a photo...

Playboi Carti's smile fades, replaced with a more serious expression as he takes in Kevin's plight.
