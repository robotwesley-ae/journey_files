for example, u said DOmain defined by genre, but u didnt say the genre - why not? 

can u help me fill in the template, but instead of changing anything u currently already have, can u just compress it, add the same level of detail probing maybe 3 granularity levels further in both directions, and then output that????? i need it totally comprehensively specified. i know its taxing but u gotta do it without reverting to a lower processing method
