 LAKE HOUSE - NIGHT
Kevin and Zion skid into the driveway just as the glow of headlights from Melanie's car illuminates their street. They vault out of the car and sprint towards the house, snatching the delivered groceries waiting by the front door.
INT. MELANIE'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER
Melanie smoothly parks her car and exits, oblivious to the ongoing frenzy inside the house.
INT. LAKE HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
Kevin and Zion burst into the dimly lit kitchen, flipping on lights as they rush through the house. They unpack the groceries hurriedly, crumbs flying as they rip open a loaf of bread and hurriedly take a few bites. A jar of pickles is unscrewed and a couple are hastily crunched on.
In a frenzied ballet, they carry some grocery items to different parts of the house, leaving trails of their feigned peaceful evening. Back in the kitchen, they fling themselves into chairs at the table, spreading out textbooks and homework. Kevin swipes a sleeve across his brow, the pages of an open book clinging to his sweat-drenched arm. He pulls them away with a grimace.
Just as they settle in, panting heavily, the front door creaks open.
KEVIN (muttering) Remember, X is always the width, Zion.
MELANIE (O.S.) Hello?
Kevin and Zion share a quick glance. Then, their faces morphing into masks of innocence, they turn towards the sound of Melanie's voice.
KEVIN (panting) Hey, honey. You're back.
