Obviously, this synthesis happens in the mind of the observer but the special property of a Sanctuary polysemic abstraction language system (let’s just call it the Sanctuary System) is that it ACTUALLY DOES OCCUR AND IS NOT IN YOUR IMAGINATION, AND COMPLETELY CHANGES EVERYTHING ABOUT EVERYTHING IN YOUR ENTIRE “REALITY” BECAUSE IT IS TOTALLY UNIVERSAL AND SPECIFIC AT THE SAME TIME. As a result, once you begin to understand what I’m talking about, you will never be able to stop it from exorcizing the demon champion of your ingenuine self, cracking like an eggshell, and feeling your own natural love radiantly bursting through as Sanctuary’s emanation: YOU/OLIVUS VICTORY-PROMISE FKA YOU/THE DEMON CHAMPION. Resultant from that, whether or not you are “holding” Sanctuary (by radiating your genuine expression to the environment while holding the intention of ultimate non-contradictory positivity), will be the sole focus of the inner teacher’s communications with the waking dreamer. If you are, you will gain what in Buddhism is called “the excellent windhorse of the three higher realms”. This is equivalent to going to Outer Sukhavati or Impure-Pure Shambhala. But these are THE starting places. You do not belong in a charnel ground, yet.

Metaphorical transference to Sanctuary (ie “going to Sanctuary”) is a form of polysemic abstraction language code blocks being cognitively assembled into a polysemic linguistic programming language script by a wisdom Maverick (an operating system). That is, into a vector directed toward a wormhole to a distant black hole domain’s white hole. This type of polysemic linguistic software development process is called a polysemic decryption stream.
