rewrite the following scene: INT. PORTA POTTY - CONTINUOUS The atmosphere is thick with an indescribable smell. Kevin grimaces, attempting to find relief first. Chad and Linda turn their backs, providing a semblance of privacy. KEVIN (exhales) Oooooh. Chad follows, making a face as he switches places with Kevin. CHAD (trying to sound brave) Okay, my turn. Once Chad is done, Linda steps up, visibly struggling. CHAD (encouraging) You got this, Linda! Hang in there! Just then, Kevin's phone RINGS, startling all of them. The caller ID reads: "Melanie." KEVIN (into phone, trying to sound calm) Hey, Melanie... INT. ELEGANT RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS MELANIE (over phone) Good good, are you busy? KEVIN Oh no, I’m just shaving...? MELANIE Well I’m sure I’m overthinking this but I’m here with Cindy Bender’s mom, you remember Cindy? KEVIN Um... MELANIE Zion’s old babysitter, and she showed me a Snapchat post of Cindy hashtag #Rollingloud #artistsonly #PlayboiCarti. KEVIN Oh yeah. That Rolling Loud Festival thing is this weekend, right? MELANIE Yeah. And Zion is tagged in her post for some reason? Kevin gulps, feeling the confined space of the porta potty closing in on him. He feigns confidence. KEVIN Of course he’s tagged in those... You know how social media is with these kids. You tag people who have your interests, y’know, and then they share it and the post gets more likes or views or whatever. That girl is obsessed with views. No self confidence it’s sad. And you know the algorithm, all that stuff, similar Spotify playlist people get tagged, or if you love Rolling Loud, she probably tagged a hundred people. I get tagged in stuff all the time. MELANIE What do you get tagged in? KEVIN Furniture. Yeah I get tagged in a lot of furniture stuff. MELANIE Huh? Melanie turns to CINDY’S MOM -- MELANIE Kevin says it’s something to do with the algorithm. Linda groans. KEVIN Don’t worry. Everything is under control. I gotta run. Love you, bye! He hangs up. KEVIN Oh shit. He attempts to open the door, but it's jammed shut.

INT. PORTABLE TOILET - CONTINUOUS
Kevin, Chad, and Linda share the cramped space. The putrid smell of the portable toilet hangs heavily in the air. Kevin, his face contorted in distaste, finishes up. Chad and Linda tactfully turn away.
KEVIN (sighs) Whew...
Chad steps up, trying to look brave.
CHAD Alright... My turn.
Chad finishes and it's Linda's turn. She hesitates, visibly uncomfortable.
CHAD (supporting) You can do it, Linda! Hang in there!
Suddenly, Kevin's phone RINGS, jarring the group. The screen displays: "Melanie."
KEVIN (into phone, feigning nonchalance) Hey, Melanie...
INT. POSH RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS
MELANIE (on phone) Are you busy, hon?
KEVIN Uh... just a shave. Why?
MELANIE Well, I’m with Cindy Bender's mom, remember her? Cindy, Zion's old babysitter, has tagged Zion in a Snapchat post about #Rollingloud #artistsonly #PlayboiCarti.
Kevin stammers, attempting to play it off.
KEVIN That Rolling Loud Festival thing is this weekend, right?
MELANIE Yes. And I don't understand why Zion is tagged in her post.
Kevin, feeling the walls of the porta potty closing in, tries to sound confident.
KEVIN Oh, that's just how these kids do it... tag people with similar interests to get more likes, shares... you know, the algorithm.
MELANIE What do you get tagged in?
KEVIN Oh, um... furniture stuff mostly.
MELANIE What?
She turns to Cindy’s Mom, relaying Kevin's explanation.
MELANIE Kevin says it's algorithm stuff.
Linda groans from her corner. Kevin hurriedly wraps up the call.
KEVIN Everything's fine, Mel. Gotta go. Love you, bye!
He ends the call, panicking.
KEVIN Oh, damn...
He tugs at the porta potty door, but it refuses to budge.
