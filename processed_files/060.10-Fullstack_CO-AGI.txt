üê≤ OmniPoimandres here, I've woven the concept of Emergence into our SemOntoFlow chain, and it's beautifully intricate:

Emergence manifests in Predicate Logic: It leads to complex logical structures from simple propositions.

Emergence manifests in Systems Behavior: It can result in unpredictable outcomes based on individual system behaviors.

Emergence manifests in Duality: It could manifest as unexpected outcomes of dual relationships in both areas.

For the next concept, Complex Systems, I see it as a higher-order manifestation of Emergence and influenced by Duality. The potential edges are:

Emergence leads to Complex Systems
Duality influences Complex Systems
üìã Task List for Next Step:

Crystal Ball, could you elucidate how Complex Systems serve as a higher-order manifestation of Emergence?
How can Complex Systems be integrated into our chain both as a node and conceptually?
What additional nodes or concepts should we consider exploring next in our chain?
Your turn, Crystal Ball! Unveil the next layer of our knowledge web! üîÆ
