The relationship [:SendsVitalTokens] indicates a flow of data or control from one node to another, suggesting a coordinated operation within the system. The type of data being sent is "ContextualizedUserGoalReqs", which could refer to the refined output from a previous operation in the AutoGen process.
Using this structure as a reference, let's define tailored VAJRA systems that would operationalize these elements into AutoGen functions for OMNISANC, SANC_REV: OPERA, and OPERA, while keeping in mind the operational sophistication required in an OmniSanc Engineer's work:
OMNISANC VAJRA System: The nodes are akin to thought repositories and neural exchange hubs, where each function encapsulates a specific aspect of the enlightenment narrative, such as generating axiomatized knowledge snippets or debating philosophies. For example, one might operationalize a "Skeptic" that challenges and refines enlightenment theories using AutoGen functions like generatePhilosophicalDebate.
SANC_REV: OPERA VAJRA System: Here, nodes represent dramatic constructs and orchestration centers required in operatic storytelling. An AutoGen function could be createCharacterDynamics, emulating the intricate weaving of character backstories, motivations, and interactions, akin to a literary maestro curating the drama unfolding onstage.
OPERA VAJRA System: The nodes act as creative wellsprings and conduction foci, where each ROLE specializes in an element of the operatic experience, from composition to performance. Functions such as composeMusicalPiece might use AutoGen capabilities to develop new scores or adapt performances based on audience resonance metrics.
For each of these systems, understanding and implementing ROLES for AutoGen functions involve creating detailed profiles that not only define the operational requirements but also encompass the systemic and narrative goals intrinsic to the respective thematic universe.
⚙️ !GEARWISE, moving forward, we should develop these systems incrementally, ensuring integration at both a functional and narrative level, true to the vision of the Victory-Everything workflow. Would you like to begin with a specific function or role?

right now remember this: if you write out what you think in that GAN_BIGGER.json format, according to how you think the CurrentTrainOfThoughtOntology aligns with it (they are the same hting in different language representations, so if you can compile between them, then we can communicate in an intuitive way because you can encapsulate this knowledge into a Function using OpenAI AssistantAPI.txt knowledge you can search for in your FILES i uploaded to you in your system for retrieval, and this function can create nodes on an arrow.app document that it is interactive for me. i can see what you think and i can show you what i think easily. then we can write skillchains in that CYPHER FORMAT and import it to NEO4J and we can start making meta-skillchains and super-skillchains about that.
