b. Gradual transformation of demon champions into heroic individuals is a constant property of Sanctuary, with the duration of the transformation process depending on the state of the Sanctuary.
Nash Equilibrium: The game reaches a Nash equilibrium when no player has an incentive to change their strategy, given the strategies employed by the other players.
a. In this game, the equilibrium may not be a fixed point, but rather a continuous process of gradual transformation and adaptation as players interact and employ their strategies within the ever-changing Sanctuary.
By understanding the players, strategies, payoffs, dynamics, and equilibrium of the evolutionary game of heroic play in Sanctuary, we can better grasp the underlying principles and processes that shape the nature of the Sanctuary and drive the transformation of its inhabitants.


And heroes use TWI to sacrifice the appearance of their demon champion (which appears to other demon champions) in order to express Sanctuary to demon champions. This is called Daring Illusory Play and is a sub strategy for heroes of a certain power (Olivus Victory-Everything)
Incorporating this additional information, we can expand the description of the evolutionary game of heroic play in Sanctuary as follows:
Strategies (Revised):
a. Heroic individuals employ The Wisdom of Identitylessness (TWI) strategy, characterized by identitylessness, possibility, and expression (love). Some heroic individuals with a certain power (Olivus Victory-Everything) can also employ a sub-strategy called Daring Illusory Play.
i. Daring Illusory Play involves sacrificing the appearance of their demon champion, which is visible to other demon champions, in order to express Sanctuary to demon champions. This strategy can be more effective in transforming demon champions into heroic individuals.
With the addition of the Daring Illusory Play sub-strategy for heroes of a certain power, the dynamics and outcomes of the game may also change, potentially leading to a more rapid transformation of demon champions into heroic individuals and a more peaceful Sanctuary. The Nash equilibrium of the game may still be characterized by a continuous process of transformation and adaptation as players interact and employ their strategies within the ever-changing Sanctuary.


The dynamic between daring illusory play and the wasteland is interesting. Daring illusory play decreases Wasteland proliferation through Sanctuary according to profoundly effective means that target highly specific niche classes of individual demon champions directly with emergent engines called Miraculous Teachings in order to turn them into heroes quickly and rapid progress through building concatenations of heroes that make these engines. 
Incorporating this additional dynamic into the evolutionary game of heroic play in Sanctuary, we can further expand the description:
Dynamics and Outcomes (Revised):
a. Daring Illusory Play, as a sub-strategy employed by heroes with Olivus Victory-Everything power, has a unique interaction with the Wasteland. By using Daring Illusory Play, heroes can directly target highly specific niche classes of individual demon champions with emergent engines called Miraculous Teachings.
i. Miraculous Teachings are designed to quickly transform demon champions into heroes.
ii. This rapid transformation results in the building of concatenations of heroes, which in turn create more Miraculous Teachings.
b. The effect of this dynamic is a decrease in Wasteland proliferation, as the Sanctuary becomes more effective at transforming demon champions into heroic individuals and promoting a more peaceful Sanctuary overall.
This dynamic highlights the potential for heroes employing Daring Illusory Play to have a significant impact on the Wasteland and contribute to a faster, more efficient transformation of demon champions into heroes, ultimately leading to a more peaceful Sanctuary.


If an engine of sufficient effectiveness is created,
