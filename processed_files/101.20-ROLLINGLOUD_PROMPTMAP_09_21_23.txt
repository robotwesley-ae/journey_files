We open on Jeremy (47) struggling to help his son, Zion (13), with math homework. Zion's distracted by Rolling Loud, the biggest hip-hop festival in the world. Jeremy has no idea what it is, and Zion's excitement doesn't help with the algebra. But then, Zion's phone lights up with the festival announcement, and he begs his dad to let him go. Jeremy's skeptical, but his persistence son eventually convinces him to take him to the festival.
Cut to Jeremy researching Rolling Loud on his computer, when his wife Samantha comes home. They're in the middle of a trial separation, but they're united in not wanting Zion to go. Still, there's tension between them.
Next, we see Jeremy at work, struggling to keep up with technology and social media. His job is on the line, and his friend and confidant can't help.
At dinner, Zion sets up a PowerPoint presentation, trying to persuade his parents to let him go to Rolling Loud. It's comedic and passionate, bringing a smile to their faces. They say "Let us discuss this," but Jeremy reveals he already bought tickets. Zion's thrilled, and the family is united.

Set-Up: Jeremy reluctantly agrees to take Zion to the festival, but he's on high alert and ensuring Zion always stays close. They arrive at the festival and Jeremy's immediately overwhelmed by the noise, crowds, and energy. They are driving to the festival, they have to park a long way away and parking costs 80 dollars that Jeremy doesn't have, but there's no choice. He'll do anything for his son. They park and start walking to the festival at Hollywood Park / Sofi Stadium parking lot. They have no idea where the entrance is and everyone is smoking weed and everyone is dressed wildly inappropriately and then they finally arrive at an entrance and there are people checking ID's because you have to be 16 in order to get in. Zion is heartbroken. Jeremy is heartbroken. There's no way he's not going to get Zion into this concert.

Jeremy and Zion finally arrive at the parking lot of Hollywood Park/Sofi Stadium. The lot is packed with cars, and Jeremy has to park in the farthest corner, which costs him a hefty $80. Zion is bouncing in his seat, and Jeremy can't help but feel a sense of dread building in the pit of his stomach.
As they get out of the car, they're immediately hit with a wall of noise, smoke, and energy. Zion's eyes are wide as he takes it all in, while Jeremy looks around nervously, scanning the sea of people.
They start walking towards the festival, and Jeremy's already regretting his decision to come. Everyone around them is dressed inappropriately, smoking weed, and shouting obscenities. He looks down at Zion, who's grinning from ear to ear, and he can't help but feel a sense of protectiveness kick in.
They walk for what feels like miles, and Jeremy's starting to feel the strain of the heat and the weight of the backpack he's carrying. Finally, they see a sign for the entrance, and they pick up their pace. But as they get closer, they see that there are people checking ID's.
Zion looks up at his dad with disappointment in his eyes. Jeremy can feel his heart breaking as he realizes that his son won't be able to get in. He can't let Zion down. Not today.
Jeremy takes a deep breath, puts on his best game face, and walks up to the ID checkers. He explains the situation to them, telling them that he knows Zion's too young but that they've come so far and they've been looking forward to this for so long.
The ID checkers exchange a look, and for a moment, Jeremy thinks they're going to turn them away. But then, one of them nods and waves them through.
