write the following scene out in FDX in the style of Todd Phillips: Kevin nods, feeling a weight lifted off his shoulders. He's glad he has a friend like Chad to talk to, someone who understands what he's going through. As Kevin confesses his struggles, Chad listens intently before sharing his own story. He starts by saying that he's never told anyone this before, but he lost his entire family in a freak boating accident. Kevin looks horrified, but Chad continues, saying that he was the only survivor and has been living with the guilt ever since. Linda interrupts, trying to one-up Chad's tragic story, saying that she was left at the altar on her wedding day and discovered her fianc√© was actually her long-lost half-brother. The shock of the revelation led to her being institutionalized for a year. Kevin's mouth hangs open, as both Chad and Linda go on to reveal more tragedy and pain in their lives. Chad shares his gambling addiction, loss of job, house, friends, and the rare disease diagnosis, while Linda talks about her failed business ventures, a series of unfortunate relationships, and her chronic sleepwalking disorder. As the conversation winds down, Kevin is left stunned by the sheer amount of suffering his friends have gone through. Chad and Linda seem to be competing over whose life is more tragic, and the stories keep getting more bizarre and unbelievable. There's talk of infertility, a shopping addiction that's left them broke, a strange medical condition that causes dehydration when drinking diet coke, legal blindness, an infected penis from an adult circumcision, being abducted in a foreign country and made into a drug mule, owning a timeshare they never have time to visit, having no electricity, and being allergic to all medicine. Kevin can't believe what he's hearing and wonders how his friends have managed to survive all of these challenges.

Kevin nods, a melancholic smile on his face. His glance says it all, relief and gratitude mixed in.
KEVIN (grateful) I'm lucky to have you guys...
Chad leans back, taking in a deep breath, a moment of sincerity in his usually comical demeanor.
CHAD (seriously) Yeah, well. Listen to this...
He lowers his gaze, a shadow crosses his face.
CHAD (whispering) I lost my family. Boating accident... and guess who was at the helm?
Kevin stares at Chad, eyes wide, his breath hitching.
KEVIN (stunned) Chad...
Before Kevin can react, Linda leaps into the conversation, her voice high pitched.
LINDA (hysterically) Try being left at the altar! By your own half-brother!
Chad and Kevin look at Linda, their mouths hanging open.
As the night goes on, the group continue their one-upping misery marathon. Chad with tales of gambling addiction, lost jobs, houses, and friends, not to mention his unknown disease. Linda counters with failed businesses, catastrophic relationships, and her battles with sleepwalking.
Kevin, still reeling, watches them go back and forth, his head swiveling like he's watching a tennis match.
By the time they've moved on to infertility, shopping addictions, dehydration from Diet Coke, blindness, infections from adult circumcisions, drug mule experiences, timeshare woes, lack of electricity, and a comprehensive allergy to medication, Kevin's mind is utterly blown.
Kevin shakes his head, both horrified and oddly inspired by their resilience.
KEVIN (murmuring) How the hell are you guys still standing?
