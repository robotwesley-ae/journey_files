
No. From anything type of instance to get the informadlib of it, to be able to isntance that same type of kind of instance without doing any work. 

Do u rly understand this? Pls 

WE HERE IN THIS CHAT NOW

NEED THE EXPERT PANEL TO USE SEMONTOREL TO DEFINE THE ONTOLOGICALLY GENERALIZED INSTANCE OF A "INFORMADLIB TABLE" that can be used as a prompt for chatGPT to make chatGPT roleplay simulate a "informadlib generator"











k. yes. also remind them that this version has undone most of the work and is totally incorrect, and is just an example of how we might fill it out if we didnt know about all the emergent structures and how we are being SEM-ONTO SPECIFIC.

For reference, this is a plain text version of the table with correct SEM-ONTO relationships. SEM-ONTO needs to be APPLIED to EVERY SINGLE THING WE WRITE IN THE TABLE. WE CANNOT JUST WRITE ENTITIES IN THE TABLE. WE NEED TO SEMANTICALLY ONTOLOGIZE THEM SO THEY CAN BE RE-INSTANCED FROM THE TEMPLATE. DO NOT CHANGE THIS RULE. DO NOT IGNORE IT. FIX EVERYTHING.
