FADE IN:
EXT. MOSH PIT - NIGHT
A HUMAN TORNADO, better known as a mosh pit. KEVIN, CHAD, and LINDA are stuck in the eye of the storm. A CROWD-SURFER, obviously confused about gravity, sends Kevinâ€™s pants into oblivion.
KEVIN (awkwardly covering) Well, that escalated quickly.
Chad cackles. Instant karma strikes as his clothes are torn away. Linda, narrowly avoiding the same fate, looks offended.
LINDA (to the crowd) Excuse me? Are my clothes not rip-worthy?
The crowd awkwardly look away. Silence in a mosh pit, who knew? It's short-lived. A sudden onslaught of SILLY STRING and empty beer cans assail them. Screaming, they're hoisted into the air by the crowd.
LATER -
The trio collapse to the ground, pantless, disoriented, Chad somehow still laughing.
CHAD Between this and our high school reunion. This is way better.
Linda, trying to maintain her dignity, leads the way out of the chaos. A small VENDOR'S CART is knocked over in their wake.
VENDOR Watch it! Those pretzels aren't free!
Linda turns back, fire in her eyes.
LINDA Get in line, buddy!
Kevin pulls out his phone, displaying the Snapchat photo of Zion.
KEVIN (eyeing the chaos) Our little pub crawl just got a level upgrade.
They disappear into the crowd, their naked escapade in the mosh pit now just another festival tale.
FADE OUT.
TO BE CONTINUED...
rewrite, but remember that Kevin's entire goal is finding his son, Zion, somewhere in one of the many mosh pits

FADE IN:
EXT. MOSH PIT - NIGHT
It's a sea of bodies in the mosh pit. Our heroes, KEVIN, CHAD, and LINDA are deep-sea divers in the storm. In the confusion, an overeager CROWD-SURFER yanks Kevin's pants away.
KEVIN (shocked) I did not sign up for this!
Chad cracks up, only to be humbled as his own outfit is torn away. Linda is left untouched, looking put out.
LINDA (indignant) Wait, why am I fully clothed?
The crowd goes awkwardly quiet. The silence is shattered by the sound of SILLY STRING cans firing and empty beer cans flying. The trio are catapulted into the air.
LATER -
Back on the ground, all of them are pantless and disoriented. Chad is doubled over laughing, while Kevin is grimacing and Linda's looking for an exit.
KEVIN (sincere) We need to find Zion, guys.
Linda, still the most clothed, takes the lead. In their hasty departure, they knock over a vendor's cart.
VENDOR (angry) Hey! You gonna pay for that?
LINDA (defiant) We're on a mission from God!
Kevin pulls out his phone, Zion's Snapchat photo still on screen.
