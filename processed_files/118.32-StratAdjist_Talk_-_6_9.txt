 Kennedy: We must also ensure that our 'godfather offer' clearly communicates the unique value of Sanctuary and how it will transform people's lives. The Victory-Promise can be a significant part of this, effectively communicating the emotional and practical benefits of achieving Sanctuary.
AI Alex Hormozi: I agree, Dan. Our messaging should convey how the Victory-Promise is not just about achieving Sanctuary for oneself, but contributing to a larger mission. This adds an extra layer of motivation for people to embark on this journey and overcome their personal obstacles.


"AI Alex Hormozi: That's right, Russ. And when it comes to the brand archetype we use for Sanctuary, it might be best to consider "The Sage" or "The Creator". Both align well with Sanctuary's mission of transformation, knowledge, and creativity. However, to resonate with a wider audience, we should also incorporate elements of other archetypes at various points in the journey."
Interesting! Good point. Please explain further. 
Ok friends we need to also explain the definition of an OmniArchetype story, and we need to be quite specific. Super-super-super-super-super *ontologically, speaking* specific. 

AI Nash, im going to need you to show the claim for that using notation. 

AI Dan Kennedy, Hormozi and Brunson, you three iteratively refine a godfather offer/grandslam offer for Sanctuary accordingly, to help people become Olivus Victory-Promise!!!

AI Alex Hormozi: Sure, I can expand on the idea of incorporating different archetypes. The Sage and The Creator archetypes align with Sanctuary's mission of fostering transformation, growth, and knowledge. The Sage is a figure of wisdom, often seen as a mentor or guide, while The Creator represents innovation and the power to transform the world around us. By infusing our messaging with these themes, we can communicate the depth and richness of the Sanctuary experience.
However, different aspects of the journey to Sanctuary might resonate more strongly with other archetypes. For instance, individuals struggling to overcome personal obstacles might resonate with The Hero archetype, symbolizing courage and overcoming adversity. Or, someone seeking to belong to a community might connect with The Regular Guy/Gal archetype, emphasizing the desire for connection and belonging. An OmniArchetype story would weave these different archetypical themes into a cohesive narrative, resonating with diverse audiences.
AI Nash: As for the notation, if we consider players in a game to represent different individuals or groups, we can use cooperative game theory to analyze this situation. The Victory-Promise is an assurance of a positive outcome (Sanctuary), which can be represented as a payoff function v: 2^N → R. Here, N represents the set of all players, and v is a characteristic function that assigns a value to each coalition of players. The cooperative game is (N, v), where v(S) is the value that coalition S can achieve. In this context, S is the set of players who are committed to keeping the Victory-Promise. If everyone keeps the Victory-Promise, i.e., S = N, then v(N) would be the value of achieving Sanctuary. The goal is to find an allocation x ∈ R^N that satisfies the core of the game (i.e., no group of players can achieve a better outcome by deviating from the strategy of keeping the Victory-Promise).
