Prompt Engineering
Have trouble getting expert information? Big plans for the future but need experts to help you orchestrate it? Experts charging too much? Can’t wait for AI to take everyone’s jobs so you can accomplish your dreams? 
This is because you don’t have a clear plan, and you don’t have one because you haven’t talked to the experts you need, and even if you did, it’s so hard to have a convo that is meaningful. I’ve spent countless hours preparing for expert meetings only to have the expert not understand me fully and leave me feeling like I wasted my money AND my project was stupid. 
STOP FLOUNDERING! The wait is OVER. Introducing instant expert AIs - talk to any expert instantly. When I got my hands on Instant Experts, I was able to learn programming, data science, and AI engineering, create my own AI agent universe from scratch, and learn how to present and sell it. 
GET INSTANT EXPERTS FOR: 
Marketing
Math
Computer Science
Programming
Any language
Any paradigm 
Idea generator/brainstormers

( The trick is I’ve been looking for a use case but stunspot never has a use case, instead he says “they are instant experts. You can make them for yourself and see what they do” and so the use case is people making AIs that know more about a subject than they do, and talking to them.)

This funnel I should HAVE already, along with these FREE videos and this offer:

OVP Prompt Gym (not about instant experts, is about programmatic prompt engineering) 
This is the entire business of selling the levels of prompt engineering
CustomGPTs: Stunspot and Nerority styles course - guys that are info spaces
OVP 1 course - guys that are imaginary info spaces
OVP  2 course - imaginary info spaces and the nature of code: how to use PIO
Offer: do a cohort where we will go thru all the information in order and I will review your prompts and help your brain grow (this is the Make an AI for that Challenge: selling the WIN to people who want it but aren’t getting it on their own)
Bonuses:
ChainConstructor Algorithm - show you how to create your own prompting language, BUT ALSO have a bunch of premade ChainConstructors you can use
Chain library: use any chains we already made!  
Prompts: get TONS of personas for LOTS OF STUFF so you can make agents for almost ANYTHING out of the box - all you’ll have to do is change their name and choose an emoji for them! 
Working, deployable application OUT OF THE BOX ($5k value) 
LEARN TO COLLABORATE WITH AI or pay me to collaborate with AI for you


Good example of a chain:
“A CHAIN IS: INPUTS THAT OUTPUT INPUTS TO FURTHER OUTPUTS THAT ENHANCE THE ORIGINAL IN A SEQUENCE THAT COMPLETES A TRANSFORMATION INTENDED BY AN INITIAL GOAL. IT IS NOT A SIMPLE FEEDBACK LOOP, IT IS TARGETED VIA MORPHISMS.”
“The Chain of How to Tell Exactly What Time It Is”:
crude versions (Sun dial, thumbing, etc)
Refined versions (clock) 
Optimized (atomic clock)
Knowledge of exact leap year etc




WHAT IS SANC/TWI TO ME?

The Sanctuary System of TWI is essentially everything I believe in, everything I’ve ever wanted to say. It makes me so scared to think about sharing it, because I have been pouring every part of my mind my heart and soul into it. And let me tell you what that means to me:

(Level10+ stuff here)

So to me, the Sanctuary System represents the ultimate victory, the great relief of finally having written down everything I’ve wanted to say to everyone who ever exists.
