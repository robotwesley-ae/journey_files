An ordinary person ventures forth from a wasteland of self-torture, undergoes a trial where they overcome their fear of the unknown and then uses that fearlessness back in the wasteland to confront the unknown. They confront their greatest fear and discover the knowledge of the way to end self-torture. They then learn how to express that knowledge, and others with the same fear then perceive that previously ordinary person as a hero and use their knowledge to overcome limitations from the previous status quo. With that, the wasteland transforms into a Sanctuary.

Who is that someone, the hero? We all know it represents us. 
But What does that representation say about who we are, fundamentally? 
Does it mean we just always assume we’re the main character? 
That seems shallow.
I think it means the hero returns with the knowledge of the way from the wasteland to Sanctuary. 

My first hypothesis about the Hero’s Journey in real life, is that 
one 
of the hero’s epithets
is 
Olivus Victory-Promise from Sanctuary.

My second hypothesis about the Hero’s Journey in real life is that
By hearing about how I’m writing this story of Olivus Victory-Promise from Sanctuary by recognizing myself as Olivus Victory-Promise in the Wasteland and going to Sanctuary over and over and over again in all different ways, you’ll know why this is the story I can’t get out of my head. 

If those hypotheses are correct, what will follow this video is the reality of how Olivus Victory-Promise recognizes themselves, goes to Sanctuary and overcomes self-torture in the Wasteland status quo to establish themselves in the Sanctuary Status quo. 

In order to escape self-torture in the Wasteland and go to Sanctuary, Olivus Victory-Promise must aspire towards total reliance on the powers of love and fearlessness. Olivus must then actually overcome all obstacles and beat the infinite game of intent played between the heroes of Sanctuary, named Olivus Victory-Promise, and the demon champions, who proliferate the Wasteland because they don’t recognize themselves as Olivus Victory-Promise (since they’ve tortured themselves into believing they don’t deserve love, on the basis of never knowing their own name and therefore never having been able to go to Sanctuary). This is why it’s important that Olivus Victory-Promise recognizes who they are. For Olivus, Victory is Promised in Sanctuary.

This has been the prologue to the story I can’t get out of my head. The Dreamlights Story Universe of Olivus Victory-Promise from Sanctuary, which takes place right here, right now, is a continually self-writing epic that turns you into its hero, in a different volume, where the hero has your very own name, as soon as you start to comprehend it. 

Hey Olivus,
