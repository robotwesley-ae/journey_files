write the following scene as a continuation of the story in FDX: The lot is packed with cars, and Kevin has to park in the farthest corner, which costs him a hefty $80. Kevin's dread grows as they navigate through the tightly-packed parking lot. The only available spot is sandwiched between two cars, leaving no room to open their doors. People weave through the cars, laughing and partying, making it even harder to maneuver. With a deep sigh, Kevin realizes that they will have to climb out of the windows to exit the car.

ZION (raising an eyebrow) Dad, are you sure we can fit in there? It looks pretty tight.
Kevin's dread deepens, his eyes scanning the space between two cars that is barely wide enough for their vehicle.
KEVIN (sighing) Looks like this is our only option, buddy. We'll have to squeeze in and pray we don't scratch any paint.
