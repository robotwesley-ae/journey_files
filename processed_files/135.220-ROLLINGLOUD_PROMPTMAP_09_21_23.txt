expand with dialogue the following scene in FDX: With food in hand, Kevin stands by the portapotties, expecting Zion to emerge any moment. However, after ten long minutes, his worry starts to escalate. Scanning the enormous, chaotic crowd, Kevin struggles to spot his son. Desperate, he tries calling out Zion's name, but the deafening noise from the festival drowns out his voice. Panic surges through Kevin as he realizes he's lost sight of his 13-year-old son in the midst of the wild festival. Kevin bangs on the door of the portapotty he thought Zion went in, pounding on it and yelling out his name. A young girl emerges from the stall, giving him a confused look. Mortified, Kevin apologizes and quickly scurries away, but the pounding on the other portapotties continues as he and Chad frantically search for Zion. People start giving Kevin strange looks as he yells out Zion's name, some even calling him out for bringing a 13-year-old to a concert like this. But Kevin is too worried to care about their judgment. Chad joins Kevin, and they begin knocking on all the other portapotties, yelling out Zion's name at the top of their lungs. But there's no response, and Kevin's panic only intensifies. Kevin pulls out his phone to call Zion, but the reception is spotty, making the call unsuccessful. His heart sinks as he realizes that technology can't help him find his son. He has no choice but to trust his instincts and rely on his own eyes to locate Zion. As Kevin frantically searches for Zion, Chad trails behind him, blabbering on about the festival. Kevin can barely focus on anything other than finding his son, but Chad doesn't seem to notice. "Dude, have you tried the vegan tacos? These are amazing," Chad says, shoving a taco in Kevin's face. Kevin takes a bite but quickly loses interest, scanning the sea of festival-goers for any sign of Zion. The crowd grows denser and more chaotic as the night wears on, and Kevin's nerves start to fray. Chad, on the other hand, seems to be enjoying himself immensely. "You know, they have a kissing booth here. It's awesome, although some people are getting herpes from it, so you have to be careful," he says with a chuckle, seemingly oblivious to Kevin's mounting panic. Between mouthfuls of beetroot burger, Kevin accidentally bumps into a group of high guys who stare blankly before wandering away. He asks a group of selfie-taking girls if they've seen Zion, but they don't pay him any mind. As Kevin's search continues, he stuffs another bite of food into his mouth, his mind racing with worst-case scenarios. What if Zion is lost, injured, or abducted? Mounting fear intensifies, making it increasingly difficult to think clearly while trying to tune out Chad's incessant chatter. "Hey man, remember in that documentary about lost children? Maybe we should start looking in trash cans and abandoned buildings." Kevin can feel his irritation growing with each outrageous suggestion. “If this is like a Taken situation, I’m all in” Finally, Kevin reaches a breaking point. Turning to Chad, he tries to remain polite but firm in his request. "Chad, I appreciate your help, but I really need to focus on finding Zion right now. Can you please give me some space?" Chad, sensing Kevin's distress and urgency, reluctantly backs off, allowing Kevin to continue his search with renewed focus and determination.
