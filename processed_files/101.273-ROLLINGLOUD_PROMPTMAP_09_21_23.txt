LINDA (trying to contain her excitement) That's amazing! He's really enjoying the festival.
CHAD (smiling) Looks like Zion's a natural performer, just like his old man.
Kevin's eyes widen with surprise as he realizes something.
KEVIN Wait a minute. How is it that I have signal here? We're in the middle of a huge festival with thousands of people!
The group falls silent, pondering the question. Chad shrugs his shoulders, while Linda and the girls exchange curious glances.
BRITTANY Maybe the festival organizers set up some kind of temporary network infrastructure?
TIFFANY Yeah, that makes sense. They must have anticipated the high demand for cell service and took steps to accommodate it.
LINDA Or maybe it's just one of those magical festival moments when everything seems to align perfectly.
Kevin's astonishment slowly turns into gratitude as he realizes the fortunate circumstances.
KEVIN You know what? You might be right. It's like fate wants me to find Zion and be a part of this experience.
The group shares a moment of appreciation for the unexpected phone service, recognizing it as a stroke of luck that may help them in their quest.

rewrite the following scene, but add that Kevin is shocked that the phone service is working: EXT. FESTIVAL GROUNDS - DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT Kevin, Chad, Linda, and the two girls find themselves on the crowded dance floor, lost in the pulsating music and high-energy atmosphere. They move their bodies in a sensual grind. Chad tries to push Linda away from the group, but she persistently comes back. Kevin's phone BUZZES in his pocket. He reaches for it, hoping it's a call from Zion, but instead, it's his wife. He hesitates for a moment, contemplating whether to answer, then decides to take the call. KEVIN (trying to sound casual) Hey honey, how's it going? INTERCUT WITH: INT. MELANIE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT Melanie, Kevin's wife, sits on the couch, her expression filled with concern. She dials Kevin's number on the phone, hoping for a reassuring conversation. MELANIE Good, good. Is everything okay there? EXT. FESTIVAL GROUNDS - DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT KEVIN Everything's great! MELANIE (V.O.) That's nice. How's the movie? KEVIN (confused) Avatar? MELANIE (V.O.) Yes, Avatar. KEVIN Oh, right. Yeah, the movie. It's great! Really intense! MELANIE (V.O.) Is everything is alright, Kevin? Kevin's mind races, searching for a convincing explanation. KEVIN Yeah, it's just one of those immersive experiences, you know? Like being transported into a whole different world. MELANIE (V.O.) How's Zion doing? Kevin lies, attempting to sound casual and reassuring. KEVIN (with a smile) Great, honey. Having a blast! MELANIE (V.O.) That's wonderful. Tell me more about it. CHAD Hey Linda, I think they need you over at the cockblock section! LINDA (calling out to the girls) Chad’s missing his penis head! Kevin tries to maintain focus. KEVIN (to his wife) Sorry, honey, the movie is just so loud right now. We're really enjoying it. Zion loves it! He glances at Chad and Linda, signaling them to make noise, creating the illusion of being in a theater. KEVIN But I gotta go now, people are giving me dirty looks for talking on the phone in here. The two girls continue to flirt, making it harder for Kevin to concentrate on the call. MELANIE (V.O.) That's good to hear. Enjoy the rest of the movie and give Zion a big hug for me. KEVIN Love you, bye! Kevin quickly ends the call. The girls continue their flirtatious behavior, making inappropriate comments, but Kevin's attention is drawn to his phone as it comes to life with notifications from Zion's Snapchat account. He frantically opens the app, scrolling through the messages until he finds a picture of Zion jumping alongside a large crowd. KEVIN (relieved, muttering to himself) Zion! It’s Zion!!! Look! He shows the picture to Chad and Linda. LINDA (excitedly) I know which stage that is! I recognize that banner hanging from the stage. It's part of the volunteer setup!
