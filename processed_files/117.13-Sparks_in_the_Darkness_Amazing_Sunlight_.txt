Resting in the outlook that sees the wisdom of timeless webbed infinitude of infinite perfection, 
Notice
if I let hopes and fears resolve themselves
There is no I
There is no them 
There is no we
There is no out
There is no in 
There is no here
There is no there 
There is no ignorance 
There is no acceptance
There is no rejection
There is no jealousy 
There is no greed 
There is no death 
There is no you
‘That’ was it!”

From now on, whenever you’re afraid of your own sparks in the darkness, with the innate heroic mind, recognize them! Seize the sword of fearlessness, cut away confusion like a sudden light in a cave, and reveal the amazing sunlight of the wisdom inside! 


Seeing this timeless webbed infinitude of infinite perfection
But still not quite “the Awakened One” yet 
Still need to know what the pattern is 
How it occurs 
And once that’s fully revealed 
It seems like you’ll be able to just… leave??? 
Apparently
But I don’t know what comes next 
And I can’t imagine how it’s going to be 
but it’s likely 
all the same 
all the way through!

Afterword

Om is the sound of the beginning of laughter
Ah is the sound of the gasp of realization of love
Hum is the sound of the continuation of loving realization laughter 

Although for me myself my name is laughter
And for me, the pulse of the display begins as a thought-feeling of inner, cosmic, universal, multi universal, general, primordial loving laughter
Who but the awakened can say
If what I wrote 
here 
are 
the teachings of 
my own deluded “wisdom” laughter 
or 
the mind of 
the union of
Oliver Powers and Olive R. Love? 
For those wandering intellectuals
Who I certainly am one of
Olive R. Love and Oliver Powers 
once whispered to me
The secret name of this text:
“Go fuck your self”
