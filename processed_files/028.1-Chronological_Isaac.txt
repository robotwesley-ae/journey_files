Steps: 

Read this document 
highlight story entities 
mark which year each section comes from (and month if you have it or time marking of any kind)
Put it in total chronological sequence (the story of MY life, not the story of me qua X)
Embellish missing information
Tag all of the highlighted entities according to their involvement in various “I am” threads (me x NOT ALLOWED) (me x NOT INCLUDED) - do not group the tags (I was not allowed to eat X so i felt excluded from being Y) instead break them up (Not Allowed [to X which is in Y class, which is a subclass of Z]) (Excluded from being Y)
This will be copied into a spreadsheet for import to arrows and Neo4j
In a new document, copy the corpus and arrange it by entity (chronologically abbreviated, as a list of “me qua X” (my relationships to entities)
Expand on each of the highlighted topics according to how it first entered your experience, and then each time it has evolved as an entity in your experience, until present, in the topic document. 
Break each timeskip and tag it [ME QUA X]
Re-enter topic data into the chronological timeline with all the tags of [me qua X]
Read your entire story in terms of how the hero’s journeys are related
Identify the stages of each overall ideal hero’s journey of Olivus Victory-Everything
Identify hero’s journeys most psychologically relevant to helping you fulfill your role as Olivus Victory-Promise according to the ideal of Olivus Victory-Everything
Create YouTube channel
Most abbreviated stories first so they can be linked to each other correctly and advertised in the videos themselves
Categorical
Instances or smallest HJ stories (The time I X’d and Y happened)
Linear HJ stories (My relationship with X, which led me to realize Y, which is related to how I became Z)
Large Non-linear HJ stories in the context of your whole life according to who you are now (How I became X that I am now, a representative of the hero who had relationships with {X, X1…}, which is related to theme Z)
Larger Non-linear HJ stories in the context of your whole life according to who you want to become (I decided to challenge myself to grow into X, on the basis of having become Y that I am now, a representative of the hero who had relationships with {X…}, which is related to theme Z)
