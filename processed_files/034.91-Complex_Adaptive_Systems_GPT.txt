Provide a real math example of using this to express a problem step by step
Let's consider a simple problem: finding the shortest path between two points in a graph, where the graph represents the knowledge space. We can allegorically represent this problem using the concepts of black holes, white holes, and wormholes in the adapted Kruskal-Szekeres-like coordinate system for the Sanctuary framework.
Define the graph: Let G(V, E) be a graph where V is a set of vertices and E is a set of edges. Each vertex represents a piece of knowledge, and each edge represents a connection between two pieces of knowledge. The graph represents the knowledge space.
Identify the problem: Our problem is to find the shortest path between two points A and B in the graph. In the Sanctuary framework, we can consider this problem as a black hole, which represents the ignorance of the shortest path.
Represent the problem in the coordinate system: Place point A on the x-axis (Wasteland domain) and point B on the y-axis (Sanctuary domain) of the adapted Kruskal-Szekeres-like coordinate system. The black hole representing the problem can be placed between A and B, indicating the lack of knowledge about the shortest path.
Identify the white hole: The white hole represents the solution or synergy that resolves the ignorance. In our case, the white hole represents the knowledge of the shortest path between A and B.
Represent the white hole in the coordinate system: Place the white hole on the coordinate system, indicating a position that corresponds to the discovered knowledge of the shortest path.
Finding the wormhole: The wormhole represents the process of moving from ignorance (black hole) to knowledge (white hole). In our case, this process involves using an algorithm to find the shortest path between A and B, such as Dijkstra's algorithm or the A* search algorithm.
Represent the wormhole in the coordinate system: Draw a curve or line between the black hole and the white hole, representing the process of finding the shortest path using the chosen algorithm.
By representing the problem, solution, and process in the adapted Kruskal-Szekeres-like coordinate system for the Sanctuary framework, we can visualize the relationships between the problem and its solution, as well as the pathway taken to resolve the ignorance. This example demonstrates how the Sanctuary framework concepts can be applied to a real math problem in a simple and abstract manner.


The white hole must start in a superposition… don’t you agree? Think step by step.
Yes, considering the context of the Sanctuary framework, it makes sense for the white hole to start in a superposition. Let's examine this idea step by step:
Unknown solution: Initially, the exact location or nature of the white hole (the solution) is unknown. This ignorance is represented by the black hole. As a result, the white hole's position or the knowledge it represents is uncertain, leading to a superposition.
Superposition: In the context of quantum mechanics, superposition refers to a system that exists in multiple states simultaneously. In the Sanctuary framework, the white hole's superposition represents the multiple possible solutions or synergies that could resolve the problem (black hole).
Exploration: The process of finding the white hole involves exploring different synergies and possible solutions in the knowledge space. This can be done by searching for wormholes, which represent pathways or connections between the ignorance (black hole) and the knowledge (white hole).
Collapse of superposition: As the exploration process progresses and the correct synergy is discovered, the superposition of the white hole collapses into a single, definite state. This represents the successful resolution of the ignorance, and the white hole is no longer in a superposition.
Representing the collapsed superposition: In the adapted Kruskal-Szekeres-like coordinate system, the collapsed superposition can be depicted by updating the position of the white hole to a specific point in the knowledge space, representing the discovered shortest path between A and B.
