Ontological Word Embedding: Although word embeddings are a common concept in NLP, ontological word embeddings are not standard. You might consider using "Semantic Word Embeddings" or "Knowledge-based Word Embeddings" to emphasize the incorporation of structured knowledge (e.g., from an ontology) into the embeddings.
Domain-Specific Encryption: This term is not standard in computer science, but it seems to refer to a tailored encryption method for specific domains or data types. You could use "Domain-Specific Encoding" or "Domain-Specific Data Transformation" instead.
Boundary Populating: This term is not commonly used in computer science. Depending on the context, you might replace it with "Boundary Detection" or "Region Filling" if the goal is to identify boundaries or fill regions in a visual representation.
Lock Mode / Unlock Mode: These terms are not standard in computer science. You could consider using "Entity-focused Mode" and "Class-focused Mode" to emphasize the difference in perspectives when exploring the data.
It's essential to ensure that the terminology used aligns with established concepts and terms in computer science to facilitate better understanding and communication with others working in the field.


oh im not really concerned about those. i meant more like, are there concepts i speak about that actually dont map to the domains i suppose them to be inside of
I apologize for the confusion. Upon reviewing the conversation, there are a few concepts that may not map directly to the domains you suppose them to be in:
Ontological Linear Algebra: While linear algebra is a well-known concept in mathematics and computer science, the term "ontological linear algebra" doesn't map directly to a known domain. It might be more appropriate to refer to it as "Semantic Linear Algebra" or "Knowledge-based Linear Algebra" if you want to emphasize the incorporation of knowledge or semantics into the linear algebraic operations.
Encryption-based Compression: While encryption and compression are both standard concepts in computer science, the idea of using encryption for compression might not map directly to existing domains. In general, encryption is used to secure data, while compression aims to reduce the size of data. You might want to consider using more common concepts like "Lossless Data Compression" or "Lossy Data Compression" instead.
Toroidal Visualization: While toroidal structures are used in various fields, such as mathematics and physics, the idea of using a toroidal visualization for representing properties and relationships in a knowledge graph might not map directly to existing visualization techniques. You might want to explore existing visualization techniques for graphs, such as node-link diagrams, adjacency matrices, or hierarchical layouts, and see if they can be adapted to fit your needs.
Please let me know if there are other concepts you'd like me to clarify or map to existing domains.


but knowledge is in the form of knowledge graphs that preserve semantics via formal descriptions of the entities called ontological application. so that is called ontological linear algebra, which can only be done on the basis of the ontological meaning of numbers mapping to the ontological meaning of ontological entities, such that one can be said in the context of the ontological interpretation of linear algebra, to represent the other when these conditions are met.
I understand your perspective on the term "ontological linear algebra." If you're using this term to emphasize the incorporation of semantics and formal descriptions of entities in linear algebraic operations, that is a valid approach. In this context, "ontological linear algebra" would refer to linear algebra techniques that operate on knowledge graphs and ontological structures, preserving the semantics and relationships between entities.
