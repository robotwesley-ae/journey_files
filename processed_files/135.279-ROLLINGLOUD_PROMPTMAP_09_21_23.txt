THE FERRIS WHEEL STOPS They are stuck on top. KEVIN What the fuck? CHAD Did it lose power? No. They’re board a wheelchair guy. Oh, no. Oh, actually it’s a whole wheelchair team. The US Wheelchair basketball collegiate team. Each one has to Roll in... CHAD They don’t call it Rolling Loud for nothing.... Maybe it’s Travis Scott or someone big who is calling for the biggest mosh pit in history. Break some records. People need to die to make this cool. Let’s beat Astroworld! What was it? 9? Let’s go for 10! This sets a dangerous ticking clock. And all of a sudden... KEVIN I need to get down. CHAD No. Let’s send Lindo. A mosh pit is forming in front of the stage. KEVIN Zion! A set piece of Kevin, Linda and Chad (all high) trying to get down from the top of the Ferris wheel. A couple of ideas: - they need to hop from pod to pod, meeting interesting people. - they need to hold onto each other like a human chain and of course, one of them slips. - if want this to feel like the movie Cliffhanger, set on a Ferris Wheel at Rolling Loud with the characters extremely intoxicated. / rewrite the above

CHAD (laughing) They don't call it "Rolling Loud" for nothing!
KEVIN (apprehensive) This isn't good.
CHAD (jokingly) Maybe they're here to set the world record for the biggest mosh pit ever. Beat Astroworld, right? What was it, 9 casualties? Let's aim for 10!
The clock is ticking, and the situation grows more tense.
KEVIN We need to get down from here.
CHAD No, I've got a better idea. Let's send Linda.
Meanwhile, a massive mosh pit is forming in front of the stage.
KEVIN Zion!
