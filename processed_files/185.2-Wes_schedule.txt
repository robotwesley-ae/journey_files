And then MANAGE THAT every minute of the day
Start the day with standup of THAT
Continue with leading the entire schedule
Because you actually need me to make content, write books, and you actually need to make the website and channels by requesting that stuff. This is actually just a preliminary aspect of your job, which is to actually a) understand b) develop the tech. 
Meaning: it is just a fact of life we have to have this channel and I’m telling you that is how I need you involved, as a PRELIMINARY to being able to be of use.
