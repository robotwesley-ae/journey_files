Emergent non-contradictory systems building and concatenation: This type of emergence proliferates within the subject as they recognize the emergent flow and its processes. It involves the subject connecting non-contradictory systems to form larger, more complex systems while maintaining their non-contradictory nature. This growth in understanding and the development of more complex systems is driven by the subject's efforts to resolve emergent hallucinations and gain a deeper understanding of the phenomena.
These two types of emergence are intertwined, as the process of resolving emergent hallucinations contributes to the growth and development of non-contradictory systems. As the subject gains new knowledge and insights, they can build and concatenate more complex systems to further their understanding of the world around them.

Now letâ€™s think about human cognition as it relates to linguistics and programming. 

Human cognition uses language to create programs and run them inside its consciousness and body, which are all the same, and these affect the world which cause emergents. 

Indeed, language is a fundamental aspect of human cognition, and it plays a crucial role in shaping our thoughts and actions. Through language, humans can create mental programs or models that represent their understanding of the world, relationships between entities, and processes that occur within it.

These mental programs can be thought of as similar to computer programs, with language serving as the code that allows humans to structure and manipulate their understanding of the world. These mental programs can be run within an individual's consciousness and body, influencing their actions and reactions to different situations.

As humans interact with the world around them using their linguistic mental programs, they contribute to the emergence of new phenomena. The actions they take, informed by their understanding of the world, can have ripple effects that influence other people, objects, and systems. This, in turn, can lead to the emergence of new patterns, relationships, and situations that humans then need to interpret and understand.

Language and cognition are deeply connected, with language serving as a tool that allows humans to construct and manipulate mental models of the world. Through this process, humans contribute to the ongoing emergence of new phenomena and continue to adapt and update their understanding in response to these emergent patterns.

But also humans can use math to create the language they need to describe emergents posed to them, unpose them, and collapse them into non-contradictory systems. This stops domain decay - domain decay is the fact that humans halt their programming when the context changes and the domain context of now is always changing in space time. 

Indeed, mathematics is another powerful tool that humans use to describe and understand the world around them. Like language, math allows humans to create mental models and representations of various phenomena. However, math offers a more precise and systematic way to describe relationships and patterns, which can be especially useful when dealing with complex or abstract concepts, such as emergent phenomena.

By using mathematical formalisms, humans can describe emergent phenomena, analyze their properties, and identify the underlying principles that govern their behavior. This process can help "unpose" or resolve apparent contradictions or ambiguities in the phenomena and lead to the construction of non-contradictory systems, which can provide a clearer understanding of the world.

Addressing domain decay, the ever-changing nature of the world and the contexts within which humans operate can indeed pose challenges to our understanding and mental models. As contexts change, our existing mental programs may no longer be appropriate or accurate, leading to a decay in their utility.
