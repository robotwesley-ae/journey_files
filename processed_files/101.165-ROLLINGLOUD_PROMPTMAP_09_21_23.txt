Not-So-Graceful Linda: Chad, always one to show off, nails his jump like an Olympic gymnast on a good day. Linda, perhaps distracted by a festival float, doesn’t fare as well and takes an unexpected detour into oblivion.
Chad’s Ridiculous Rappel: Ever the show-off, Chad decides the Ferris wheel's pulley system looks fun and tries to zipline down. Miraculously, he only manages to slide partway, causing a spectacle and then sheepishly climbs back to Kevin.
Kevin's Panic and Pluck: Left mostly to his own devices, Kevin eyes a gigantic teddy bear with a blend of desperation and a dash of "this might be crazy enough to work."
Comedic Tightrope: Kevin and a slightly charred Chad tip-toe the Ferris wheel's beam, trading quips. Chad, spotting a photo-op for his social media, gets distracted and - oops! - takes the express route down.
Bear-Ly Made It: Kevin, armed with the teddy bear, does a dramatic, arms-splayed jump, belly flopping onto the bear, looking like a kid who's bitten off more candy than he can chew.
Miraculous Meet-up: Amidst the chaos below, Kevin dusts off to find Linda and Chad, who've both seemingly taken the scenic routes down. They all exchange "how did YOU survive?" glances, promising to never speak of this again... until the next festival.
Great. Now write this in the form of a screenplay
ChatGPT
Certainly! Here's a condensed screenplay version:

INT. FERRIS WHEEL POD - NIGHT
Kevin, Chad, and Linda find themselves trapped high above the ROLLING LOUD FESTIVAL. The flashing lights of the festival dance below them.
KEVIN:
Why did I agree to this?
LINDA: (Squinting)
Hey, there's a pod below us. We could jump.
CHAD:
I've done crazier things. Let’s wing it!
KEVIN:
Like what?
CHAD:
Like... jumping now!
Chad jumps, nailing his landing in the pod below. He waves up, grinning.
LINDA:
Okay, here goes nothing.
As Linda jumps, she gets thrown off by a gust of wind.
LINDA:
Not like this!
She disappears into the darkness. Kevin and Chad stare in shock.
KEVIN:
We need a plan, fast!
CHAD:
I got it!
Chad spots the Ferris wheel's pulley system.
CHAD: (Grinning)
Watch this!
Against better judgment, Chad leaps onto the pulley system. He slides down partway with a lot of noise, drawing attention from below. He then scrambles back up, slightly singed but mostly intact.
KEVIN:
Seriously?
CHAD:
Seemed like a good idea.
KEVIN: (Desperate)
There! The teddy bear!
He points to a GIGANTIC TEDDY BEAR in a nearby pod.
KEVIN:
I’m using that to cushion my fall!
They inch towards it on the central beam. Chad, spotting someone taking photos from below, poses for a selfie.
CHAD:
For the ‘Gram!
Suddenly, Chad loses his balance.
CHAD:
Bad idea!
He falls, leaving Kevin alone.
KEVIN:
Every time...
With determination, Kevin reaches the teddy bear pod, negotiates quickly with a KID, snatches the bear, and jumps. He lands hard, cushioned by the bear.
GROUND LEVEL
Kevin looks up to see Linda, a bit ruffled, and Chad, wrapped in a festival banner, both alive and kicking.
LINDA:
I landed on an inflatable stage prop. You?
CHAD:
Took a tour of a few tents. You?
KEVIN: (Hugging the bear)
Never again.

Note: This is a concise screenplay format, omitting some screenplay conventions for brevity.
Great. Now rewrite in the style of Todd Phillips, but add the tension of Free Solo
ChatGPT
Certainly! "Free Solo" is a documentary about Alex Honnold's daring ascent of El Capitan without ropes. The tension from that kind of high-stakes climb can be added for suspense.

INT. FERRIS WHEEL POD - NIGHT
The camera lingers on the dizzying height. Kevin, Chad, and Linda are trapped. The festival's tiny lights blink below, emphasizing the perilous drop.
KEVIN:
(Breathing heavily)
Why did we think this was a good idea?
LINDA:
We just need to focus. There's a pod below.
CHAD:
Like a boulder problem. One move at a time.
KEVIN:
This isn’t rock climbing, Chad.
CHAD:
But it's about precision.
With laser focus, Chad leaps, barely landing safely in the pod below. He gives a "rock on" sign.
