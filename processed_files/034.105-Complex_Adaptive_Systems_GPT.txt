Introduce the concept of Sanctuary: Explain the idea of Sanctuary as a state of non-contradictory peace and harmony, where all beings and phenomena can coexist without conflict or suffering. Emphasize that Sanctuary is not a physical place, but a state of mind and being that can be achieved through practice and self-reflection.
Present the Sanctuary System: Describe the Sanctuary System as a framework that can help them transform their thoughts and actions from those that promote suffering and conflict (Wasteland proliferation) to those that nurture peace and harmony (Olivus Victory-Promise). Explain the key components of the system, such as synergies, fields, and the role of Heroic Individuals, without overwhelming them with technical details.
Discuss the concept of Demon Champions: Gently introduce the idea that some individuals, called Demon Champions, may unintentionally perpetuate suffering and discord due to their ignorance or misunderstanding of the Sanctuary System. Explain that recognizing oneself as a Demon Champion is the first step towards transformation and embracing Olivus Victory-Promise.
Offer guidance on self-transformation: Share actionable steps for self-transformation, focusing on cultivating self-awareness, embracing identitylessness, and practicing non-contradictory thinking. Encourage them to practice formal Sanctuary cultivation and seek guidance from Heroic Individuals or other sources of wisdom.

Reiterate that the goal is to achieve Olivus Victory-Everything, a state where peace and harmony are pervasive.
