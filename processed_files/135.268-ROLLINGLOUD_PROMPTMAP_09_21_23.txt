Chad tries to push Linda away from the group, attempting to create distance, but she persistently comes back, seemingly oblivious to Chad's efforts. The dance floor experience becomes even more intense.
Kevin's phone rings, interrupting the moment. He reaches for it, hoping it's a call from Zion, but instead, it's his wife. He hesitates for a moment, contemplating whether to answer, then decides to take the call.
KEVIN (trying to sound casual) Hey honey, how's it going?
MELANIE (V.O.) Good, good. Is everything okay there?
KEVIN (trying to sound upbeat) Everything's great!
MELANIE (V.O.) That's nice. What about Avatar? How's the movie?
KEVIN (confused) Avatar?
MELANIE (V.O.) Yes, Avatar. That's where you said you were going, remember?
Kevin's mind races, searching for an excuse to cover his mistake.
KEVIN (realizing his mistake) Oh, right. Yeah, the movie. It's great! Really intense!
MELANIE (V.O.) That's good to hear. What about Zion? How's he doing?
Kevin lies, attempting to sound casual and reassuring.
KEVIN (with a smile) He's doing great, honey. Having a blast!
MELANIE (V.O.) That's wonderful. Tell me more about it.
As his wife starts to probe for more details, Kevin's attention is divided. Chad and Linda make inappropriate comments in the background, and the two girls continue to flirt, making it harder for Kevin to concentrate on the call.
CHAD (rude comment, interrupting) Hey Linda, I think they need you over at the cockblock section!
LINDA (rolls her eyes, muttering) I should cut off Chad's penis.
Kevin tries to maintain focus, speaking louder to drown out the noise.
KEVIN (to his wife) Sorry, honey, the movie is just so loud right now. We're really enjoying it. Zion loves it!
He glances at Chad and Linda, signaling them to make noise, creating the illusion of being in a theater.
KEVIN But I gotta go now, people are giving me dirty looks for talking on the phone in here. Love you, bye!
Kevin quickly ends the call, relieved that he's avoided getting caught. The girls continue their flirtatious behavior, making inappropriate comments, but Kevin's attention is drawn to his phone as it comes to life with notifications from Zion's Snapchat account.
He frantically opens the app, scrolling through the messages until he finds a picture of Zion jumping alongside a large crowd.
KEVIN (relieved, muttering to himself) Thank god.
He shows the picture to Chad and Linda, their curiosity piqued.
LINDA (excitedly) I know which stage that is! I recognize that banner hanging from the stage. It's part of the volunteer setup!
