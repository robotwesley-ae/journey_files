SAMANTHA (sighing) Hey guys. What's going on? ZION (excitedly) Rolling Loud just announced their lineup. Can we go? Jeremy shoots a look at Zion, warning him not to push it. Samantha looks at the two of them, a bit perplexed. SAMANTHA What's Rolling Loud? ZION (energetically) It's a hip-hop festival. All the best rappers are gonna be there. SAMANTHA (skeptical) Isn't that kind of, I don't know, inappropriate for a 13 year old? JEREMY (nodding) Yeah, that's what I said. ZION (defeated) But all my friends are going. I don't want to be left out. Samantha puts the laundry down and sits next to Jeremy.
SAMANTHA (serious) Jeremy, we need to talk about something. (beat) We've been having some problems in our marriage, and we've decided to take a break. I don't think now is the time to be indulging Zion's whims. JEREMY (nodding) Yeah, I agree. It's not safe for a 13 year old to be surrounded by that kind of environment. ZION (deflated) Fine. I'll just stay home and do more math homework. SAMANTHA (sighing) I know it's hard, but we're doing what's best for our family right now. Jeremy and Samantha exchange a sad look, both clearly struggling with their emotions.
Theme Stated: The struggle between a father's protectiveness and a son's desire for independence is introduced, but the subtext is that Jeremy and Samantha's separation is causing tension and uncertainty within the family.

here is the order of scenes I want for act one: 1) Jeremy helping zion with homework. Rolling Loud is announced. Jeremy says no. Zion slinks off, heartbroken 2) Jeremy researching rolling loud on his computer, and Samantha comes home - to establish that they are in the middle of a trial separation and trying to keep it from Zion. Even though they are both on the same page with not allowing Zion to go rolling loud, there is an undercurrent of tension between the two of them, neither of them is happy with their lives in their current state. 3) establish Jeremy at work, establish a friend and confidant. Establish that Jeremy isn't doing great at work. He's struggling. He can't keep up with the modern tech and social media stuff. 4) Jeremy and Samantha are eating dinner together. Tension in the air, barely speaking. Zion comes downstairs with his computer and asks if he can speak to his parents. He sets up the greatest powerpoint presentation ever, trying to persuade his parents to let him go rolling loud. The passion and comedy in his presentation brings a smile to both of his parents. For a moment, they share an incredible pride in their son. The scene ends with "let us discuss this."
