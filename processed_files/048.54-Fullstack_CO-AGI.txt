Task Analysis
Feasibility of "Difficulty Levels" in SANC:
While it's feasible to implement "difficulty levels" in SANC narratives, doing so requires robust branching logic and extensive user testing. The challenge lies in making sure these levels are genuinely reflective of the reader's capabilities.

Challenges in Meta-Language Development:
Creating a meta-language for Onto-Math and SANC interaction poses challenges like comprehensiveness and accessibility. The language would also require frequent updates to keep pace with advancements in both disciplines.

Practical Implications and Risks in Pilot Project:
A successful pilot could validate the real-world applicability of Onto-Math methodologies. However, risks include potential public resistance to math-based governance and the risk of implementation failure, which could discredit the initiative.

# Task 1: Designing branching logic for "difficulty levels" in SANC to accommodate different reader profiles
branching_logic_sanc = '''
Branching logic for "difficulty levels" could be designed using decision trees or state machines that adapt to 
user choices and performance. For instance, if a reader successfully decrypts a complex cipher, the narrative 
could branch into a more challenging path, offering deeper insights into the SANC universe.'''
