Chad nods sympathetically. "I'm sure he's fine, man. Kids are resilient. And besides, you've got this. You're a great dad."
Kevin smiles, grateful for the support. As they finish their food, he realizes that he's been so focused on finding Zion that he hasn't had a chance to catch up with an old friend.
"So, what about you, Chad? What have you been up to?" he asks.
Chad's eyes light up again, and he launches into a story about his latest venture, a startup that combines yoga and karaoke. Kevin listens politely, still worried about Zion but appreciating the distraction.
As they pack up their trash and prepare to leave, Chad slaps Kevin on the back.
"Hey, it was great seeing you, man. Let's catch up again soon, yeah?"
Kevin nods, feeling a little overwhelmed by Chad's energy but grateful for the unexpected reunion. As they stand up to leave, he realizes that he still hasn't heard from Zion. His anxiety spikes, and he realizes that he needs to find his son before it's too late.

As Kevin scans the area, looking for a way to locate Zion, he spots a food truck nearby and decides to grab some food for them both. As he joins the line, he suddenly hears a familiar voice behind him.
"Kevin? Is that you, man?"
He turns to see Chad, a former classmate from high school. Chad looks as if he hasn't aged a day, with his unkempt hair and loud Hawaiian shirt.
"Chad, wow! How are you?" Kevin replies, surprised but friendly.
Chad begins to reminisce about the old days, sharing stories of their high school antics. Kevin can't help but laugh at some of the memories, feeling a sense of nostalgia.
As they wait in line, Chad starts to recommend vegan options from the food truck, insisting that he pays for their meal. Despite Kevin's protests, Chad won't take no for an answer, even pulling out a wad of cash from his pocket.
"Come on, man. Let me buy you some food. We're both here to have a good time, right?" Chad says with a grin.
Kevin relents, grateful for the help and the food, which costs a fortune at the festival. As they sit down to eat, Chad continues to talk about the past, but Kevin can't shake the feeling that Chad is a little too enthusiastic about their reunion. Nonetheless, he appreciates the gesture and enjoys the meal, feeling a brief respite from the chaos of the festival.

In his altered state, Kevin starts to see things - giant chickens, talking trees, and dancing unicorns. He starts to freak out. Chad grabs a glow stick and shoves it up his butt, then takes off running around the entrance, screaming and laughing maniacally. Seeing Chad's distraction, Linda decides to join in and starts dancing wildly while yelling about her love for Playboi Carti. The security guards are distracted by Chad and Linda's bizarre antics, and Kevin seizes the opportunity to sneak into the artists-only area." But include some brainstorming from Linda and Chad while kevin is freaking out from the drugs
