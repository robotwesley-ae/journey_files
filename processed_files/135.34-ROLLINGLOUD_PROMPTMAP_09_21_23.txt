As Jeremy falls off the stage, he's caught by a familiar face - Chad, an old high school acquaintance who's been attending Rolling Loud for years. Chad helps him up and notices the desperation in his eyes.
"Jeremy, is everything okay?" Chad asks, concerned.
Jeremy spills his story to Chad about losing Zion, and Chad tries to reassure him that his son is safe and probably just wanted some time to himself.
"Remember me, man? We went to high school together. I saw you up on stage and had to come say hello," Chad says, trying to lighten the mood.
Jeremy is momentarily distracted by the unexpected reunion, but his mind quickly returns to Zion. Chad notices the panic rising in Jeremy's voice and offers to help him search the festival grounds.
"Let's split up and cover more ground," Chad suggests. "We'll find Zion together, I promise."
Jeremy nods, grateful for the unexpected help. Together, they continue their search, calling out Zion's name and asking anyone they come across if they've seen him.

You were up there dancing with Shenseea, right?"

Chad leans over to Jeremy and whispers in his ear, "Looks like we're not going to be alone tonight." Jeremy chuckles nervously and takes another sip of his drink, feeling the alcohol starting to go to his head.
The girls introduce themselves as Brittany and Tiffany, and they start flirting with Chad and Jeremy. Tiffany leans over to Jeremy and says, "You were so hot on stage, baby. I bet you can show us some moves."
Jeremy blushes and starts to feel even more embarrassed. He's not used to this kind of attention, and he's also worried about Zion. But he can't deny that he's a little intrigued by the girls.
Chad, on the other hand, is eating up the attention. He's always been a ladies' man, and he's enjoying the company of the two girls.
As they continue to chat and flirt, Jeremy starts to loosen up a little. He even starts to dance with Brittany, who seems to be really into him. For a moment, he forgets all about Zion and just enjoys the music and the company of the girls.
But then, Chad's phone rings, and he excuses himself to take the call. When he comes back, his face is grim.
"What's wrong?" Jeremy asks.
Chad hesitates for a moment before saying, "I just got a text from one of my buddies who works security here. They found a kid wandering around by himself. He fits Zion's description."
Jeremy's heart leaps into his throat. "Where is he?" he asks, his voice shaking.
Chad pulls out his phone and starts to type a message. "He's at the medical tent near the main stage. Let's go."
The two girls look disappointed as Chad and Jeremy make a quick exit. But Jeremy doesn't care. He's just relieved that they might have found Zion.

what if a notification comes through from Jeremy's wife at this point, asking how it's going?
ChatGPT
Sure, that's a good idea. Here's a potential way to include it:
As Jeremy and Chad continue to chat with the two flirty girls, Jeremy's phone buzzes with a notification. It's a message from his wife, asking how things are going.
He quickly types back a response, telling her that he's still looking for Zion but that he's okay. As he puts his phone back in his pocket, he realizes that he hasn't been paying attention to the conversation with the girls.
"Sorry, what were you saying?" he asks, turning back to the girls.
"We were just asking if you guys wanted to come back to our hotel room for a nightcap," one of the girls says, twirling her hair.
