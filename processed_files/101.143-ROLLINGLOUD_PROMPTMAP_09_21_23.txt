write the following in FDX: Shenseea gives Kevin a sultry look and exclaims, "Well, well, well, if it isn't my dance floor king from earlier. You were killing it out there, baby." Kevin feels embarrassed but also flattered by the attention. Shenseea leans in, brushing her hand against his arm and asks him his name. "Uh, yeah, it's Kevin," he stammers. "Kevin," she repeats, rolling the name off her tongue. "I like it. Maybe you and I could dance together later." Kevin's mind races with possibilities, but his focus is on finding Playboi Carti and, more importantly, his son. Suddenly, he feels a sharp pain in his back and turns around to find a little person who was watching him earlier, now clinging to him and punching him while wrapping her legs around his head. Shenseea jumps in, quickly pulling the little person off of Kevin and calming her down. It's revealed that the little person is a trained MMA fighter who holds a grudge against Kevin for crushing her earlier in the night. Kevin is left stunned and disoriented, trying to process what just happened, his face throbbing in pain. He finally speaks up, "I need to find Playboi Carti, can you help me?" he asks Shenseea, hoping she can point him in the right direction. Shenseea looks at him quizzically, wondering why he's so determined to find the rapper. Kevin hesitates, not wanting to reveal too much. "I'm just looking for my son," he finally admits, showing Shenseea a picture of his son and Playboi Carti in the artists-only area on Snapchat. He wonders if that's where he could be. Feeling bad about what happened, Shenseea decides to help him out. "I don't know where your son is, but I can show you the Playbus," she offers.
