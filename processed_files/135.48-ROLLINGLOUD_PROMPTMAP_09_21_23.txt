As Chad finishes his emotional story, Jeremy's phone rings, interrupting their conversation. It's a message from his wife with a clue about Zion's whereabouts. However, the message only fuels Jeremy's anger as it reveals that Zion actively chose to separate from his father and run off with a group of teenagers, leaving Jeremy feeling betrayed and frustrated.
As they continue their search, Jeremy turns to a very high Chad to be his wingman on this journey. Together, they stumble through the crowd, asking anyone and everyone if they've seen a teenage boy with curly hair and a bright red shirt.
However, Jeremy's intoxication and highness start to take a toll on him as he struggles to keep his balance and maintain focus. Chad isn't doing any better as he keeps getting distracted by shiny objects and people in elaborate costumes.
At one point, Jeremy spots a group of teenagers who look like they might know Zion. He charges over to them, demanding to know if they've seen his son. The teenagers just look at him like he's crazy and tell him to back off. Chad tries to intervene, but he's too high to really be of any help. He starts laughing uncontrollably at everything and nothing, drawing attention to himself and Jeremy.
Jeremy's anger starts to boil over, and he starts yelling at anyone who will listen, accusing them of taking his son or knowing where he is. Chad, still giggling, tries to calm him down, but it's no use. Jeremy is on a mission, fueled by anger and alcohol.
They make their way to the main stage, where a headlining act is about to perform. Jeremy scans the crowd, hoping to spot Zion in the sea of faces. But it's no use. He's lost his son, and he doesn't know if he'll ever find him.
As the music starts, Jeremy and Chad stand together, swaying to the beat. For a moment, they forget about their troubles and just enjoy the moment. But as the night wears on, the reality of their situation sets in. They're lost, alone, and desperate to find Zion.

I would love some suggestions for a better, more clever clue here: "As Chad finishes his emotional story, Jeremy's phone rings, interrupting their conversation. It's a message from his wife with a clue about Zion's whereabouts. However, the message only fuels Jeremy's anger as it reveals that Zion actively chose to separate from his father and run off with a group of teenagers, leaving Jeremy feeling betrayed and frustrated."

Sure, here are some alternative clues:
"Zion just posted a selfie with a group of strangers on Instagram, location tagged as 'Lost and Found Stage' at Rolling Loud."
"One of Zion's new friends just posted a Snapchat story at the Ferris wheel, with Zion tagged in it."
"Zion's debit card was just used at a food truck near the 'Electric Avenue' stage."
"Your son just left a voicemail on your wife's phone, giggling and saying something about 'the crazy guy with the light-up shoes' at the 'Bass Drop' stage."

I like this one if it's a butt dial "Your son just left a voicemail on your wife's phone, giggling and saying something about 'the crazy guy with the light-up shoes' at the 'Bass Drop' stage."

That could definitely work! Here's a rewritten version of the scene incorporating that clue:
As Chad finishes his emotional story, Jeremy's phone rings, interrupting their conversation. He picks it up to see that it's a call from his wife, but before he can even say hello, he hears a faint voice in the background.
"Hey, that guy's shoes are so cool!" the voice giggles. "Dad's gonna be so mad he missed this."
Jeremy's heart races as he realizes the voice belongs to Zion. He quickly puts the phone on speaker, hoping to hear more.
"I can't believe you dragged me to this stupid festival," his son's voice continues. "But that guy's shoes are worth it. He's at the Bass Drop stage. You should come check it out."
As the call ends, Jeremy and Chad exchange a look of relief. They finally have a solid lead on Zion's whereabouts. Jeremy knows he needs to move fast if he wants to find his son before anything else goes wrong.
