Everyone knows how to play their spec (know your JD that you apply tactics from)
Everyone competes to be the most efficient and productive
There are meters
Reward queues are based on this
Everyone admits when they make a mistake in executing the tactic, and they are forgiven as long as their mistakes are confessed. Everyone has to be doing their best which means doing better and better each time
Small mistakes (dock you points in perception but nbd)
Wipes (mistakes that wipe the raid)
If they don’t understand how they made a mistake, but they know what they did was a mistake, it is re-explained to them and they must perform it perfectly for the rest of the night 
Continued wipe causing mistakes results in removal 
This is equivalent to repeatedly not performing some part of the required tactic
Bonuses are paid according to performance and consistency. 
Everyone gets the same basic pay, so the disparity is large
Farm — at this level, tactical deployment only takes 2 days/wk instead of 5
Raid consistently completes the weekly process each week with less and less mistakes 
All the rules of tactical deployment apply
This is equivalent to when employees make the company money. Whenever you are hired by a profitable company, you are working at this level. 
This is the same as product-market fit
Sale — happens on farm days 2 days/wk
Raid is so efficient at farming that it requires less people to complete and therefore starts to return on investment as slots can be sold
This is equivalent to when stock of a company can be sold for massive profit. Whenever you are hired by profitable public company, you are working at this level

PvP

Once everything is on farm/sale, you can move into PvP at which point raid communication and etiquette still applies. If you don’t get to the top 0.5%, you are still learning how to play. If you don’t get into the top 0.1%, you are not high elo. If you don’t get into the top 0.05%, you are not top elo. This is equivalent to an entrepreneurial side project. 
Finding a team/choosing a composition
Finding other elite level players that either show your level of promise or are more experienced than yourself
Using the available player pool to find an optimal composition to play 
Compete
Study the strategies used by others playing the same composition at top elo
Know your win and loss conditions
Or if you are at top elo, compare all your offensive abilities and devise combinations that force situations in battle 
Compare all defensive abilities and find bare minimum necessary to live through all attack combinations from other compositions
Develop enemy specific strategies 
Force cool down
Force kill window
