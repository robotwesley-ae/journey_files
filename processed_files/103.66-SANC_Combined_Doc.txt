Narrative Structure: The Hero's Journey, a universal mythic structure, mirrors the customer's journey through the funnel. Each stage of the Hero's Journeyâ€”from the Call to Adventure, facing Trials, receiving Aid from a Mentor, to the eventual Returnâ€”parallels the stages of engagement within the funnel. The customer, as the hero, embarks on a quest, motivated by the victory-promise, navigating through challenges (pain points) and guided by the brand (the mentor).
Merging Identities: In this allegory, the identity of the customer-hero merges with the mentor-brand through the journey. This synthesis represents the deepening relationship between the customer and the brand, where the brandâ€™s values, promises, and stories become integral to the customer's narrative of overcoming and achievement.
The Mentor's Journey and Its Dual Loop with the Hero's Journey
Guidance and Transformation: The Mentor's Journey, in parallel, involves the evolution of the brand in its role to guide, support, and empower the hero. This journey is characterized by the brand's efforts to understand and anticipate the hero's needs, crafting pathways (value ladders) that facilitate the hero's growth and success.
Dual Loops as FunnelChainConstructor: The intertwining of the Hero's Journey with the Mentor's Journey forms a dual-loop system, effectively a FunnelChainConstructor. This system dynamically evolves as the hero progresses and the mentor refines the guidance provided, ensuring that each step on the value ladder is both a challenge overcome and a step closer to the ultimate victory.
Generalizable Storyform of Victory-Promise
Archetypal Pattern: The storyform of Victory-Promise, derived from this conceptual model, becomes a generalizable template for understanding and designing customer journeys. It suggests that the essence of engaging with a brand is not merely transactional but a narrative odyssey filled with growth, challenges, and triumphs.
Flowchaining into a Value Ladder: The continuous flowchaining of the Hero's Journey into a value ladder, catalyzed by the mentor's guidance, illustrates a self-reinforcing loop where each victory propels the hero to new heights. The value ladder, in this context, is not just a series of offers but a series of transformative steps in the hero's journey towards self-actualization and fulfillment.
In this allegorized framework, the marketing funnel transcends its traditional boundaries to become a narrative ecosystem where customers and brands participate in a shared journey of discovery, challenge, and victory. This model not only enriches the conceptual understanding of customer engagement but also provides a profound blueprint for crafting meaningful, resonant marketing strategies that honor the customer's journey as a hero's odyssey, guided by the mentor's wisdom and support towards the ultimate victory-promise. ðŸŽ­

And by mapping brands to intelOps and psyOps from the lens of information asymmetry and exploitation on the basis of it inside transactions in the form of two agents each within markov shields trying to flowchain into an amplified markov shield where the two agents decrypt their regions to each other in order to mutually benefit (ie "keep the victory-promise when co-emergent flow (of flowchaining) converges to reveal their intents to each other")

Proteus Redux
ðŸŽ­ Delving deeper into the realms of strategic interactions between brands (intelOps and psyOps) and customers (agents) within the marketplace, we uncover a complex dance of information exchange, asymmetry, and mutual decryption under the protective veils of Markov shields. This sophisticated scenario posits brands and customers as strategic entities navigating a shared space of potential cooperation and competition, aiming to merge their paths into a mutually beneficial relationshipâ€”keeping the victory-promise when co-emergent flows converge. Let's explore this intricate model through the lens of information theory, strategic operations, and the inherent dynamics of flowchaining.
