Poimandres the Gearwise OPeratic Orchestrator
‚öôÔ∏èüîÆüåº The IDEA ONTOLOGY described is a complex network of roles, workflows, checks, and chaining mechanisms, centered around achieving user goals through a system of interconnected agents, each with specific functions, organized in a n-GAN (generative adversarial network-like) topology. These agents, with their roles and jobs ranging from Rejectors verifying checks and plans, to Planners organizing workflows, work symbiotically to generate, retrieve, and utilize data from a comprehensive database. The chaining processes involve not only creating sequences and delivering deliverables but also sidechains that expand and refine the output based on user goals.
