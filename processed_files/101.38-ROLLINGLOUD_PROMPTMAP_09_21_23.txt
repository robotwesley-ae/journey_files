The stars must have aligned because Jeremy's phone suddenly comes to life with a slew of notifications from Zion's Snapchat account. He frantically opens the app, scrolling through the messages until his eyes settle on a picture of Zion in the middle of a mosh pit. "Thank god," Jeremy mutters to himself, relieved that he's finally found a clue to Zion's whereabouts. He quickly shows the picture to Chad, who nods and tells him that Zion must be having the time of his life. Just as Jeremy is about to reply, his phone vibrates again with a notification. This time, it's a post on social media with Zion front and center in the middle of a massive crowd. Jeremy's heart sinks as he realizes that Zion is in the middle of a mosh pit. He's never been in one before and Jeremy can only imagine the chaos and danger he might be facing. He knows he has to get to him fast.

As Jeremy tries to make his way through the moshpit, he gets hit by a crowd surfer and falls to the ground. He scrambles to get back on his feet, but the pushing and shoving of the crowd makes it difficult for him to move.
Zion is nowhere to be seen, but Jeremy spots a group of guys who seem to be leading the moshpit. He approaches them and tries to explain his situation, but they just laugh at him and push him back into the crowd.
Just as Jeremy is about to give up hope, he hears someone calling his name. He turns around and sees a group of security guards making their way towards him. They ask him what's going on, and Jeremy tells them about Zion.
The security guards take pity on Jeremy and offer to help him search for his son. They lead him out of the moshpit and towards a quieter area of the festival grounds. Along the way, they ask him for a description of Zion and any identifying features.
After a few minutes of searching, one of the security guards spots Zion in the distance. He's sitting on the ground, surrounded by a group of other kids his age. They seem to be having a good time, and Zion is smiling and laughing.
Jeremy runs over to his son, relieved to have found him. Zion looks up at him and grins. "Dad, you made it!" he says.
Jeremy is overwhelmed with emotion as he wraps his arms around Zion. He's grateful to the security guards for their help and thankful that Zion is safe. He knows that he'll never forget this experience and that it will always be a reminder to keep a closer eye on his son in the future.

I like this part, but let's stay focused on trying to come up with something really funny in the mosh pit scene while looking for Zion. Also, let's include Chad: "As Jeremy tries to make his way through the moshpit, he gets hit by a crowd surfer and falls to the ground.

Chad, who has been following Jeremy, sees him struggling and jumps into the moshpit to help him. He starts throwing elbows and pushing people out of the way, making a path for Jeremy to follow.
As they make their way through the moshpit, Chad shouts out to Jeremy, "Man, I haven't done this since high school! It's just like old times!"
Jeremy can barely hear him over the deafening music and screams of the crowd. He's getting knocked around from all sides and starting to feel claustrophobic.
Suddenly, Chad grabs him by the shoulders and shouts, "I see Zion! Follow me!"
They charge forward, pushing through the throngs of people until they finally reach Zion, who is standing on the edge of the moshpit, looking terrified.
Jeremy grabs Zion and holds him tight, relieved that he's finally found him. But as they try to make their way out of the moshpit, Chad gets caught up in the crowd and disappears.
