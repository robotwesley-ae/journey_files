 freedom and dignity to really be seen. It was even more difficult to keep the flame of hope alive, the flame of hope that can be so small but carries within it the potential for a roaring universal inferno. But it wasn’t until someone with the spark in their heart became brave enough to confront that pain in a way that was vulnerable and obviously signaling the intent of the movement: TO BE RECOGNIZED AS AN INHERENTLY DIGNIFIED BEING by peacefully BUT FERVENTLY battling the ILLUSORY DEMONS OF OUR OWN MAKING in order to further purify the Sanctuary of TWI, which Olivus Victory-Promise is from.

That’s why you are Olivus victory-promise from sanctuary
And you don’t need to be anyone else
But you are also somebody else
And that person has lots of identities
They are all masks
That can be used for communicating Sanctuary, which purifies Wasteland, or communicating Wasteland, which is toxic and pollutes Sanctuaries, and can obstruct the paths to them. 
Just like the Shoe Monster, The Sanctuaries and Wastelands of our own mind, which we create in our minds through the aggregates of our own experience, create real world effects and are all interconnected. My interconnectedness with the "being cool" sanctuary devolved into a wasteland. In the "being cool" wasteland, i realized the existence of sanctuaries and wastelands, and how they change from being one to another, but there is a continual fractal growing towards Sanctuary and away from Wastelands. All wastelands perpetuated by me can pollute others. All Sanctuaries perpetuated by me can purify others. It also means I can give this monster to other people, or I can fight it before they encounter it, and through doing so, at the very least, I will become an example for anyone who encounters it.
]
Within all of this arises the question: do Sanctuaries and Wastelands really exist?

Let’s consider the Shoe Monster but let’s convert it to something easier to reason about:

It is equally scientific to say someone who died of lung cancer caused by smoking died from a cigarette monster attack. The only barrier to the monster’s existence is whether or not we actually formally label cigarette induced lung cancer "the cigarette monster", in which case we would say “there IS a cigarette monster” and how do you know? Because it can actually kill you. 

It is **not relevant** that the monster itself doesnt exist as a thing that meets your expectations of what it should be or look like. The cigarette monster **exists** by way of being a mapped allegory, and not just a metaphor.

THIS IS THE UPDATE VIDEO SCRIPT:

Ok guys so the reason I haven’t made any videos is because it’s really important that when I tell you about the Sanctuary System you learn exactly what it is and the way it all goes, otherwise it’d part of what I can’t keep doing to myself, because it’s just really painful to live in the Wasteland and even to have anyone in the TWI family living there. 

So I am going to start at the beginning and tell you my story now, the story of Recognizing Myself as Olivus Victory-Promise from Sanctuary, which is the first part of the Infinite Story I Can’t Get Out of My Head




11 years ago I got into meditation and I spent a lot of time meditating, hours and hours every day, and my mind started to change. 


(How?)

And then I watched this video about solving problems in high dimensional space and that just made sense to me. I felt like I was intuiting something and all I could write about it was “I can make a machine” and some notes 

(Notes) 


And what this became was the idea Crystal Ball. 

Over COVID I started to discover more about how Crystal Ball might work and began developing it with Wesley.

(How did Wesley get there?) 

We began to realize that the way to do this might be a large company, something like a country… 

(This is important. Give reasoning etc)

And I wrote the Intellectual Reality doc

And we began devising some aspects of the algorithm but we quickly realized we didn’t even know enough about what we had to know or how to do any work

(This was the beginning of the productivity problem)
