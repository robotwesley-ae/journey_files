TWI Nexus Shares


Founder Shares of the company 
So we keep control 

Board Shares of the company / Launch Shares (from the nexus) 
So we spread control in exchange for investment

System Shares / Inspirational Project Shares (from the nexus)
Refers to the shares from working for TWI as well as the shares earned by working on Inspirational Projects

Project Shares (from the nexus) / Public Shares of the company
From making projects and posting them to Nexus, regardless of how well they do; or from buying shares. 

Inspirational Shares (from the nexus) 
From inspirational, non-project based aspirations 

Aspirational Shares (from the nexus) 
From people just sharing their feelings, accomplishments, aspirations, etc. Much like tweets, stories, Facebook statuses, etc

Interaction shares 
Only three types of interactions with posts: 

I found this helpful (like) - awards no shares 

I found this helpful because… (comment) - awards a share 

I wish I had found this helpful but I had trouble integrating it into my view because - awards an interaction share but if it leads to further discovery then it can award inspirational shares and even inspirational project shares

And this is all on a blockchain so if anyone is found to be cheating, their shares found to be illegitimate will be deleted from the ledger. 

The algorithm can basically be an ontology alignment thing that looks at the words or word-based description of the content and outputs whether or not it contains the necessary pieces to qualify as either:

First part
a positive comment 
a constructive positive comment 
inspirational 
aspirational 
a project

Second part
a part of the system
Board, Launch & Founder Shares 

Whatever content you create for the platform awards you one of these. 

We post the idea, we get the founder shares
Some other people post the activity of investing and get the launch/board shares, etc. It all exists on the network. 


We can have now:

Prototype 
An ethereum or otherwise smart contract based (polygon) token set of NFTs of successful posts that we can hand out to wallets associated with the user accounts
 
A website where we can at least post the social media links etc to our own projects and our friends’ etc. 
The entire project blueprint for Nexus 
And all the levels of meaning of that 
And whatever else connects to that as a natural branching

Where everyone can apply for shares with their posts
Intake form
Creates abstract 
Abstract can be in the form of words but also can be an embedding of the original thing ie YouTube video, tweet, etc. 

A mobile app
Directory of Categories and Keywords from which to get abstracts as a scroll list 

Pitch deck
Contains entire project blueprint for the Nexus in terms of how it is a self perpetuating value machine
