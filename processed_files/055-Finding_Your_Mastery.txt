Which hero journeys have you been through? 
Which niches do they apply to? 
Which niches are growing exponentially? Am I in one of them? If not, which journeys do I need to undergo to be in one? 
Which has the biggest TAM, lowest barrier to entry?
How can you use your mastered skills to create the business of selling your mastery?
Ambitious vision/promise but not grandiose, which will turn people off

And lead to YZ. 
We can’t judge our value according to other people’s mastery, but we can learn from them and compare hero’s journeys.
