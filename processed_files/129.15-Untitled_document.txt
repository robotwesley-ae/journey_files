⁠Tonic⁠  Let's dive into how the journey of Olivus Victory-Promise (OVP) in SANC aligns with the buyer's journey and the intriguing possibilities that unfold when players attain the endgame stage known as "Olivus Victory-Ability". The buyer's journey and OVP's journey share striking similarities, both characterized by distinct stages that participants must navigate to achieve an end goal.  Recognizing Need/Quest Initiation: Both the buyer and OVP embark on their journeys due to a recognized need. The buyer may be seeking a solution to a pain point, much like OVP is propelled into a quest after identifying a challenge or goal within the SANC world.  Researching Solutions/Quest Progression: Upon acknowledging their respective needs, both the buyer and OVP must seek out possible solutions. The buyer explores the market, examining various products or services, while OVP embarks on their quest, availing of the resources within SANC and interacting with other players.  Evaluating Options/Strategy Development: Both the buyer and OVP reach a crucial stage where they must evaluate options and strategize. The buyer weighs up the advantages and disadvantages of each solution, considering factors such as cost, brand reputation, and efficacy. OVP will assess strategies, tools, alliances, and routes that could lead to quest completion.  Overcoming Obstacles/Quest Challenges: Encountering and surmounting hurdles mark both journeys. The buyer may deal with doubts or budget constraints. In contrast, OVP grapples with in-game challenges or competing players.  Making Purchase Decision/Quest Completion: Upon successfully navigating previous stages, a decisive action is taken. The buyer makes a purchase, and OVP accomplishes their quest. (edited)

Now, when players reach the "Olivus Victory-Ability" stage, they can become entrepreneurs in the SANC economy by utilizing an array of blockchain-based game tools, offering solutions or services to other players. These could range from quest assistance, trading rare items, to providing useful game strategies or mentoring new players. These entrepreneur players operate similar to businesses stepping into a market. Their offerings are the "products/services", and their clientele are "buyers" in the SANC world. Thus, the entrepreneur player must understand their potential customer's journey, their pain points, and desires, to effectively provide valuable offerings. However, to use these potent game tools, they need traction or confirmed benefit/merit to ensure fair play and balance. They earn this through advancing in the game, contributing to the in-game community, and proven success in their entrepreneurship. This parallels real-world scenarios where businesses need to establish a reputation, demonstrate value, and gain customer trust before they can access extensive market opportunities. Hence, not only does SANC provide an exciting and engaging game experience, it also serves as a sandbox for players to learn, experiment, and hone essential real-world skills.  (edited)
