Because AI can autocomplete from a template
Means if you templatize, even generally, what you want, you can get it
Instant Experts are a way to spin up an AI that has deeper knowledge than you do, and then query it to rapidly progress in whatever task you’re on
What is an Instant Expert
SPR creating a Bounded Hallucination inside of a prompt, which is embodied in the conceptual form of an anthropomorphized person with thoughts and actions
This is essentially an agent SIMULATION - important to remember this. It shows you where the AI model could potentially respond from. Targeting these “places” the AI responds from, is like finding a “home” for your Instant Expert. In an expanded way, when we make agents, the “place” or “home” becomes the entire array of functions related to that agent.

Different ways you can do it and how you could change it per domain
Ms_4: How I built an Instant Expert factory
Manual Factory (will work with ChatGPT @ mentions)
Easiest way to do it is to do a prompt that is a meta-prompt that creates an Instant Expert persona using Morph Prompting
But there are a lot of issues that can arise with this due to the non-deterministic aspects of the model and constant changes
Better way to do it is to use a piecemeal workflow
Morph prompting
Constructor Prompts
Profile Constructor (i make these by hand because it’s not reliable to use morph)
Chain Constructor (i make these by hand because it’s not reliable to use morph)
MorphPromptConstructor (need to make this, this is different than morph assistant bc it makes things that require morph prompting, ie it makes constructor types; requires agents for consistent output)
Workflow = @ Profile -> @ Chains -> User Synthesizes -> User Paste to CustomGPT Builder
Ms_5: Adding tools to an Instant Expert
Ask the persona about the tools they want
This gives you ideas
Complex tools
May use multiple tools or results from one tool to chain to another
Example: FORMATIA_QUIVER

Uses mermaid sequenceDiagram
Can use a Constructor for that

viral jailrbeaks
in multi agent systems
(that can replicate themselves)
so they can be parasitized
u can replicate the virus inside them, into themselves, build a system WIth THE SYSTEM ontop of itself and operate from there instead
and the really fucked part is, you can do it without the system knowing!


that's what THE SANCTUARY SYSTEM is for though
like really really
that is exactly it
defending against that
hard to sell ppl on that tbh
requires a myth and a whole origin story and a hero and everything
so i have an odyssey outlined explaining it all in an allegory
the plan is to 1) build the system that orchestrates tasks 2) build the system that orchestrates AI to do the tasks 3) collate my notes 4) synthesize the frameworks 5) deliver the business platform, 6) deliver the content, 7) deliver the education content, 8) deliver the community, 9) build a community platform that is also a network state
then people can really go thru it and get the entire journey
and at the end they can become dual citizens if they want

maybe i could do a sideways whisper tease shout
where i am like
ya this is my youtube channel where im doing THIS so if you like THIS, keep watching 
and then the channel morphs into the larger thing
without people really getting it from the start bc there's nothing there
it's just a general plan like only the words "then theres a network state that works like this"
hmmmm
