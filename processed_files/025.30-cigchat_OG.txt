Expert 2 (Ontologist):
Expanding on the 'cognitive process-to-knowledge domain', I propose 'information-acquisition-process-to-knowledge-domain'. This extends the class by not just focusing on cognitive process, but also considering the method of information acquisition in the narrative.
Expert 3 (AI Architect):
Building on 'information-acquisition-process-to-knowledge-domain', I suggest 'knowledge-creation-context', which emphasizes how the narrative context and interactions shape the learning process and the creation of knowledge.
Final Analysis - Expert 4 (Super Analytical Narrative Semiotician):
The experts have deepened our understanding of how knowledge acquisition occurs within the narrative. They've taken the initial sem-onto relationship and extended it, considering the narrative context and the process of knowledge creation. This allows us to understand more deeply the dynamics of learning in the narrative context.
Current informadlib status:
Through [learning_method/verb: knowledge-creation-context] [subject_matter] from [source/mentor: knowledge transfer], [main_character: narrative-contextual behavior] successfully [applies_knowledge/verb: applied knowledge-to-context] during [specific_situation], earning [positive_reaction: collective reaction] from [group] but [negative_reaction: individual reaction] from [individual].
Template:
"Through [a process of creating knowledge] [an area of knowledge] from [a source of knowledge], [a character acting in narrative context] successfully [applies knowledge] during [a particular context], earning [a collective sentiment] from [a group] but [an individual sentiment] from [an individual]."
How to train your dragon example revised:
"Through [learning: knowledge-creation-context] dragon behavior from Toothless [source of knowledge], Hiccup [narrative-contextual behavior] is able to subdue the captive dragons during training [applies knowledge: applied knowledge-to-context], earning admiration [collective sentiment: collective reaction] from his peers but suspicion [individual sentiment: individual reaction] from Astrid."
no. that is not the way it works. u do not then generalize the template because the template is supposed to have the name for the types of relationships we are seeing, because we do not have names for those. pls revise

Apologies for the confusion. I understand the request better now. Let's revise based on the previous format where we retain the original labels and simply provide more detail in their definitions.
Revised Round 5:
Expert 1 (Computational Linguist):
[learning_method/verb: cognitive process-to-knowledge domain]: This relationship captures the method of learning and the area of knowledge being transferred. It could represent symbolic processes of growth or transformation within the story's context.
