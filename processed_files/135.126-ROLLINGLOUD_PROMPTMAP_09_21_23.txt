Caught in the middle of this strange volley, Kevin watches as these stories of misfortune and resilience bounce back and forth. With each tale more unbelievable than the last, Kevin finds himself drawn into their narratives - the resilience behind each misfortune, the strength beneath each struggle, and the laughter that somehow persists amidst it all. It's a testament to the human spirit, he thinks, and to the friendships that can weather any storm.

INT. CAMPSITE - NIGHT

Chad and Linda sit on either side of a dying fire, Kevin sandwiched between them. The glow of the embers illuminates their faces, lending an air of intimacy to their stories.

CHAD
(smirking)
Well, you think that's bad? Try this. I once had this addiction...

LINDA
(rolls eyes)
Oh, here we go. Chad's gambling addiction saga...

CHAD
(scoffs)
At least I wasn't trying to sell diamond-studded collars to iguanas!

They both laugh, while Kevin just blinks in confusion.

LINDA
(defensive)
It was a legitimate business venture!

Chad chuckles before growing serious.

CHAD
(sighs)
The addiction took my job, my house... even my friends.

Kevin glances at Chad, his brows furrowed in sympathy. Chad just shrugs, a small smile playing on his lips.

CHAD
(smirks)
And let's not forget the mystery disease that doctors can't figure out.

Kevin is about to respond when Linda jumps in.

LINDA
(laughs)
And you thought that was bad. I dated a vampire!

Chad and Kevin burst into laughter.

KEVIN
(astonished)
A vampire?

Linda nods, a proud grin on her face.

LINDA
(beaming)
And he was deathly allergic to garlic bread. 

Chad and Kevin share a look of disbelief. Linda just shrugs, nonchalant.

LINDA
(smirks)
And let's not even get into my sleepwalking adventures. Ever woken up in a duck pond?

Kevin watches in amazement as Linda and Chad share another hearty laugh, their stories painting a bizarre, almost surreal, picture of resilience.

Kevin nods, a melancholic smile on his face. His glance says it all, relief and gratitude mixed in. KEVIN (grateful) Thank you guys for helping me tonight. I know weâ€™re gonna find him. I can feel it... CHAD (hesitant) I once lost everything on a blackjack table. Job, house, friends... Kevin's eyes widen in disbelief. LINDA Try investing all your savings into a pet grooming business. Spoiler: They all ran away. Chad raises an eyebrow, undeterred. CHAD Unidentified disease. Three doctors, zero answers. LINDA (deadpan) Had a boyfriend. Turned out to be a con artist. Left me with debts... and a chihuahua. (put the following pros into FDX format with dialogue) Chad's blindness after an unfortunate run-in with a lemon, Linda's dehydration caused by an inexplicable reaction to Diet Coke, Chad's painful infection post an adult circumcision, and Linda's terrifying drug mule experience. CHAD I once owned a timeshare in Florida. Never been there once. LINDA I'm allergic to all medicines. Even the placebo ones! CHAD I lost my family. Boating accident... and guess who was at the helm? Kevin stares at Chad, eyes wide, his breath hitching. LINDA (hysterically) Try being left at the altar! By your own half-brother! Chad and Kevin look at Linda, their mouths hanging open.

Chad and Linda share a knowing look. Chad clears his throat, looking into the dying fire.

CHAD
(hesitant)

Kevin's eyes widen in disbelief. Linda smirks, crossing her arms over her chest.

LINDA
I invested all my savings into a pet grooming business. Spoiler: They all ran away.

Chad raises an eyebrow, undeterred. He takes a deep breath before dropping his bombshell.

CHAD
Oh, and I have an unidentified disease. Three doctors, zero answers.

Linda winces in sympathy. But she's not about to let Chad take all the glory.

LINDA
(deadpan)
My ex was a con artist. Left me with debts... and a chihuahua.

The horror stories continue, each more absurd than the last.
