The goal of Olivus Victory-Everything-Sanctuary-Everywhere is to constantly work towards creating and maintaining peaceful sanctuaries for the majority of spaces, while recognizing that there will always be some demon champions proliferating the Wasteland and creating wrathful sanctuaries for themselves.
