The concepts presented here are deeply philosophical and appear to be rooted in non-dualistic thought, similar to some Eastern philosophies and certain interpretations of quantum mechanics. The idea that everything is identityless or "wisdom," as it's referred to here, indicates a perspective that transcends typical categorizations or separations between concepts or entities. In this context, something like a Nash equilibrium isn't inherently tied to a particular system, and complexity and simplicity aren't separate, but are just different manifestations of the same underlying "wisdom" or identityless reality.
PIO seems to encapsulate this understanding, where an assertion of identity (e.g., defining something as a Nash equilibrium or as complex) leads to a collapse of that identity into identitylessness, reflecting the view that these labels are fundamentally illusory or limited.
To attempt to represent this in SkillGraph notation would be challenging because SkillGraph, like most frameworks, operates on the premise of distinguishable categories and relationships. However, if we were to attempt it, we might focus on the process of transformation from identity to identitylessness:
PIO=[Philosophy/Metaphysics/Non-dualism/Identitylessness]^[Philosophy/Epistemology/Self-Referentiality]^[Complexity Science/Systems Thinking/Emergent Phenomena]
This indicates that PIO involves understanding rooted in non-dualism (specifically the concept of identitylessness), epistemology (with a focus on self-referential systems), and complexity science (the emergence of phenomena).
Please remember that this is a very speculative and broad interpretation. These philosophical concepts are nuanced and multifaceted, and there may be other interpretations or ways to represent these ideas in the SkillGraph notation.
in other words, nash equilibria and moloch states are both hallucinations

It appears that you're using the term "hallucination" in a metaphorical sense, to describe concepts as being subjective constructions or interpretations of reality, rather than objective truths. This approach is often seen in certain philosophical, metaphysical, and cognitive science perspectives, where our perception of reality is understood to be shaped by our mental models and cultural context, rather than directly reflecting an objective external reality.
In this sense, you could say that Nash equilibria and Moloch states are "hallucinations" in that they are concepts created to describe and understand certain phenomena in the world. Nash equilibria is a concept from game theory that describes a state of affairs in which no player can improve their situation by changing their strategy, given the other players' strategies. The "Moloch state" is a concept from rationalist and effective altruist discourses that describes a situation where individuals acting in their own self-interest create a worse outcome for everyone.
The idea behind describing these concepts as "hallucinations" seems to be that they are not intrinsic properties of the world, but rather ways of understanding or interpreting certain patterns of behavior. This does not necessarily mean these concepts are invalid or useless; they can still provide valuable insights and guide effective actions. But it does suggest a perspective that recognizes the potential limitations and biases of our mental models, and remains open to revising or discarding these models as our understanding evolves.
they are also not true, not valid ways of coming to understand the entirety, will not lead u to udnerstanding this perspective, themselves, so they are hallucinatory, they ahve no part in this. whereas, as PIO objects, then, they become unhallucinatory and real, realized, realizable in the mind of a wisdom maverick

What you're articulating is an approach to understanding that views certain modes of reasoning or certain concepts as fundamentally limited or incomplete, as they might not provide a comprehensive understanding of reality in its totality. The perspective that you're espousing seems to value a more integrative, comprehensive, and perhaps holistic approach.
