Among the colorful and daring outfits, Kevin's eyes land on a girl wearing pants with the ass cheeks cut out, leaving him momentarily stunned.
KEVIN (under his breath) What on earth...?
He quickly averts his gaze, feeling even more out of his element. Kevin's protectiveness kicks in, and he instinctively looks down at Zion, who is grinning from ear to ear, completely absorbed in the vibrant atmosphere.
KEVIN (concerned) Zion, stay close to me, okay?
Zion nods, still captivated by the excitement surrounding him.
ZION (excitedly) Don't worry, Dad! I'm right here with you!
Kevin musters a small smile, touched by Zion's unwavering enthusiasm. He places a hand on Zion's shoulder, offering both support and reassurance.
KEVIN (softly) Just remember, buddy, if anything feels uncomfortable or unsafe, we leave immediately. Deal?
Zion looks up at his dad, his eyes filled with trust.
ZION (resolute) Deal, Dad. But I think we're going to have the time of our lives!
Kevin's initial trepidation begins to soften, replaced by a glimmer of hope and anticipation. He squeezes Zion's shoulder gently, his sense of protectiveness mingling with a newfound sense of adventure.
KEVIN (with determination) You know what, Zion? I think you might be right. Let's make some unforgettable memories together.
They share a moment of mutual understanding and support, ready to face whatever challenges and surprises await them at Rolling Loud.
FADE OUT.

KEVIN Please, we came all this way, and I promised him we'd go. I'm his father, and I'll be with him the entire time. Can't you make an exception? The guard shakes his head firmly. GUARD No exceptions. No one under 16 gets in. Kevin looks at Zion, trying to hold back tears, and puts a reassuring hand on his son's shoulder. KEVIN I'm sorry, buddy. We tried.
