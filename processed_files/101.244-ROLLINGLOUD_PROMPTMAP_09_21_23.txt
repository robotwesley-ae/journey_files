EXT. ROLLING LOUD VENUE - NIGHT
Linda confidently flashes her volunteer badge, allowing them to maneuver through checkpoints and restricted areas with relative ease. Their purposeful strides draw the attention of festival-goers, who give them curious glances as they pass by.
FESTIVAL-GOER 1 (nudging their friend) Hey, look at them. They must be important to get through like that.
FESTIVAL-GOER 2 (wide-eyed) I wonder what they're up to. They seem on a mission.
As they navigate through the crowd, Kevin notices the curious stares and whispers from festival-goers. He can't help but feel a mix of excitement and unease.
KEVIN (whispering to Chad) I think people are starting to notice us. We need to stay focused.
CHAD (confidently) Don't worry, Kevin. We're on a mission, and we're going to find Zion. Let them wonder.
LINDA (eagerly) Guys, look! There's the artist's entrance. We can use it to get closer to the stage.
They approach the artist's entrance, where security guards stand watch. Linda confidently walks up to one of the guards, her volunteer badge shining in the dim lighting.
LINDA (flashing her badge) We're with the festival volunteers. Just need to check something backstage.
SECURITY GUARD (nods, impressed) Alright, go ahead. But make it quick.
As they enter the restricted area, festival-goers nearby glance at them with curiosity, wondering what their purpose might be. Kevin feels a mix of anticipation and pressure as their actions draw more attention.
FESTIVAL-GOER 3 (to their friend) I wonder what they're doing backstage. Must be something important.
FESTIVAL-GOER 4 (excitedly) Maybe they're part of the production crew! I wish I could go backstage too.
KEVIN (low voice, to Linda and Chad) Let's keep moving. We don't want to attract unnecessary attention. We're getting closer.
They maintain their purposeful strides, focusing on their mission while catching glimpses of envious eyes following their every move. The sense of urgency intensifies as they approach their destination, eager to reunite Kevin with his son amidst the pulsating beats and enthusiastic crowd of Rolling Loud.
