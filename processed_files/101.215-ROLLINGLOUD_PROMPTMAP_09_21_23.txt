With food in hand, Kevin stands by the portapotties, expecting Zion to emerge any moment. However, after ten long minutes, his worry starts to escalate. Scanning the enormous, chaotic crowd, Kevin struggles to spot his son. Desperate, he tries calling out Zion's name, but the deafening noise from the festival drowns out his voice.
Panic surges through Kevin as he realizes he's lost sight of his 13-year-old son in the midst of the wild festival.
KEVIN (to himself) Where is he? Zion! Where are you?
Kevin's heart races, fear gripping him like a vice. He pushes through the crowd, desperately searching for any sign of Zion's familiar face.
Suddenly, he spots a festival staff member, clad in a bright orange vest.
KEVIN (grabbing the staff member's attention) Excuse me! Have you seen a young boy? Thirteen years old, wearing a black Rolling Loud shirt?
The staff member scans the area, his expression sympathetic.
STAFF MEMBER (sincerely) I'm sorry, sir. I haven't seen anyone matching that description. But let's find security, they can help you locate your son.
Relief washes over Kevin as he realizes he's not alone in this search. Together with the staff member, they navigate through the throngs of festival-goers, desperately seeking assistance from the festival security team.

Kevin and the staff member approach the festival's security area, where a group of stern-looking SECURITY GUARDS stand watch.
KEVIN (out of breath) Excuse me, I've lost my son. Thirteen years old, black Rolling Loud shirt. Have you seen him?
The security guards exchange concerned glances before one of them steps forward, his voice reassuring.
SECURITY GUARD Don't worry, sir. We'll do everything we can to locate your son. Please provide us with his description and any identifying features.
Kevin takes a deep breath, his voice trembling with worry.
KEVIN He's about five feet tall, brown hair, and brown eyes. He's wearing a black Rolling Loud shirt and black shorts. Please, find him.
The security guard nods, his tone empathetic.
SECURITY GUARD We'll launch an immediate search and notify all staff members to keep an eye out for your son. Stay here, and we'll update you as soon as we have any information.
Kevin nods, his anxiety still palpable.
KEVIN (whispering) Please, be safe, Zion.
As he waits for news, Kevin's mind races with thoughts of Zion's safety. The lively festival atmosphere now seems overshadowed by worry and uncertainty, casting a shadow over what was supposed to be a day of joy and celebration.
