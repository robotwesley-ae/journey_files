Kevin and Zion continue their long trek through the festival grounds, the scorching sun beating down on them. The distant sight of a sign for the entrance gives them a renewed sense of hope, and they quicken their pace. But as they approach, their hearts sink as they see a line of people being checked for identification.
A stern GUARD stands at the entrance, meticulously examining each person's ID.
GUARD (looking at Zion) How old is he?
Kevin takes a deep breath, his voice laced with desperation.
KEVIN He's 13, but I'll be with him the entire time. We've traveled so far, and this means everything to him. Is there any way you can make an exception?
The guard maintains a stoic expression, well-versed in dealing with hopeful festival-goers.
GUARD I understand your situation, sir, but festival policy is clear. No one under 16 is allowed entry. We have strict guidelines to ensure the safety and enjoyment of all attendees.
Kevin's face falls, his eyes darting between the guard and Zion, searching for a glimmer of empathy.
KEVIN Please, I promise to take full responsibility for him. We just want to experience this together, make some lasting memories. He's been looking forward to this for months.
The guard's stern facade softens for a moment as he glances at Zion's crestfallen expression. He sympathizes with their desire to share a special experience.
GUARD I appreciate your passion, sir, but rules are rules. It wouldn't be fair to others if we made exceptions. Safety is our top priority.
Kevin's voice quivers with a mix of disappointment and determination.
KEVIN I understand your concern for safety, but I assure you, we'll stay together, we won't cause any trouble. We just want to be a part of this moment, create memories that will last a lifetime.
The guard hesitates for a moment, his gaze shifting between Kevin and Zion. He recognizes the genuine bond between father and son, but his duty to uphold festival regulations remains.
GUARD I wish I could help you, sir, but I can't make an exception. The age restriction is in place for a reason.
Kevin's shoulders slump, feeling defeated. He turns to Zion, his voice filled with regret.
KEVIN I'm so sorry, buddy. We gave it our best shot.
Zion's face falls, his youthful excitement replaced with a heavy sense of sadness. They stand amidst the bustling crowd, the vibrant atmosphere of the festival contrasting sharply with their disappointment.
FADE OUT.
