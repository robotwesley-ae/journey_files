INT. ROLLING LOUD FESTIVAL - MOSH PIT - NIGHT
The MOSH PIT rages on. Kevin, Chad, and Linda are deep in the belly of the beast.
LINDA (squints) Is that him over there?
She points to a distant figure.
KEVIN (strained) No, that's not Zion... let's keep moving.
Suddenly, Chad launches into a nostalgia-induced monologue.
CHAD (laughs) This reminds me of that time we stole Principal Lawson's golf cart and ended up in a parade!
Kevin looks at Chad, incredulous.
KEVIN (frustrated) No, Chad, I don’t remember that because it never happened. Focus, we need to find Zion.
They push onward, swallowed once more by the sea of bodies.
The crowd crowd surfs them with a lot of energy, sending them flying a great distance, finally being tosses into a vendor’s tent, knocking it over. When they come to, they see that Linda is on fire and jump on her to put it out so she is safe. / expand on this

EXT. ROLLING LOUD FESTIVAL - MOSH PIT - NIGHT
The crowd propels Kevin, Chad, and Linda forward, crowd-surfing them with vigorous force. They travel like projectiles through the air, taking in the surreal sight of a sea of raised hands underneath them.
KEVIN (screaming) I really hate crowds!
CHAD (screaming, laughing) This is the best ride ever!
Finally, their wild ride ends as they crash into a VENDOR'S TENT. Drinks, snacks, and festival merchandise spill everywhere, creating a colorful mess. They lay there, panting and disoriented.
KEVIN (groaning) Is everyone okay?
Suddenly, a glow illuminates Linda's face. They turn and see Linda's clothes on fire from a knocked-over lantern.
CHAD (shouting) Linda, you're on fire!
LINDA (nonchalantly) So I am.
Kevin and Chad scramble to their feet, swatting at the flames. Linda stands still, seemingly unfazed.
KEVIN (panicking) Stop, drop, and roll, Linda!
LINDA (smirking) You think I haven't been on fire before?
Kevin and Chad manage to smother the flames. Linda brushes herself off, unscathed, as they all take a moment to collect themselves amidst the chaos.
