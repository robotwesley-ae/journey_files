Productivity
Actually make sure we are on schedule
Inner flow
Doing it
Creating DEPs
Assembling bonuses
Break out Journeys
Enum obstacles
Rev Eng solutions
Outer flow
Compassion in action
Production schedule
System chains
Input the How To Clickup information for each task type
THIS IS PRELIMINARY, NOT AN ACTUAL PIECE OF WORK: Collating everything I send you into the correct deliverables BY YOUR OWN IDEAS
If I send you a chat, BREAK IT DOWN: is it for a video, a bonus, adcopy? I am NEVER JUST SENDING YOU STUFF TO READ!
Once X is categorized, then it needs to be mapped to its potential deliverables
NEVER EVER leave something related to any of THESE JOBS as simply inputted into the system. That is NEVER what I am implying by giving you info. It is a sign of work that needs to be done. 

Match this into the weekly schedule:

How we make a YouTube video:

BUILD:
Wesley looks at current channel and compares to competitors
Wesley brainstorms the future of the channel
Perception of Isaac knowledge
Divided by Wesley interest
= Hypothesis of What audience needs
=> build MVP ⇔ PTYA frameworks
Wesley cross references his idea with all the work Isaac has already done 
Wesley creates video idea and script (according to 7-stage TWI template w/ HIVES and hero’s journey)
Wesley sends that to Isaac 
Isaac and Wesley finalize the script
Wesley schedules the shoot
Wesley and Isaac set up the shoot and shoot the video
Wesley edits
makes thumbnail, title
Posts
Social media
LinkedIn
TikTok
Facebook

MEASURE:
Wesley gathers data
Wesley and Isaac review data
LEARN: continue or pivot

Today:
10 min meeting on this document
Wesley actually do the chain to get the video made
Wesley actually produce the channel and come up with what the entire array of content is GENERALLY GOING TO BE and what I need to make for it besides the script - ie prompts, writing, stories, etc whatever (PER HAVING READ THE DOCS AND CHATS I SENT and being INTERESTED IN IT to make OVP)
This is the whole reason Wesley has PTYA
And marketing machine

Because IDEALLY, Wesley does all of that, Isaac writes prompts and sanctuary, and we get a technical cofounder to do the data and stuff, and they can easily use rivet. 
Until then, we will need to do this ourselves. Is it easiest for Wesley to do it or is it too much?



My needs:
