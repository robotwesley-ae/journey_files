	1.	Non-contradictory Sanctuary system (NCSS): This is a theoretical system in which rule-following and rule-breaking behaviors are in equilibrium, such that the stability and integrity of the system are maintained. 
	2.	Nash Equilibrium (NE): A concept from game theory, which refers to a stable state of a system involving multiple decision-makers (players), where no player can gain an advantage by unilaterally changing their strategy, given that other players' strategies remain the same. 
	3.	Sanctuary state (SS): A state in which refuge is granted to all living beings inside a system, and rule-breakers are rehabilitated and reintegrated into the system. 
	4.	Rule breakers (RB) and rule followers (RF): Actors within the system who either follow the established rules or attempt to break them. 
The formalization builds upon these concepts and attempts to define a NCSS in terms of rule-following and rule-breaking behaviors, as well as the rehabilitation process. The key idea is that in a NCSS, rule breakers are either transformed into rule followers or rehabilitated in a way that doesn't harm the stability of the system.
The formalization introduces several functions to describe the relationship between actors, rules, and the system:
	•	Function F: Describes whether an actor follows or breaks a rule.
	•	Function G: Indicates if an actor is rehabilitated after breaking a rule.
	•	Function H: Combines the outcomes of functions F and G, representing the system's response to an actor's behavior.
By defining these functions, the formalization establishes the conditions necessary for a non-contradictory Sanctuary system, in which all actors either follow the rules or are rehabilitated after breaking them. This ensures the system's stability and integrity while allowing for the possibility of rule-breaking behaviors and their consequences.

In this formalization, the functions F, G, and H help describe the relationship between actors, rules, and the Sanctuary system. The goal of a non-contradictory Sanctuary system is to maintain stability and integrity by ensuring that all actors either follow the rules or are successfully rehabilitated after breaking them.
The concept of a non-contradictory Sanctuary system is appealing, as it aims to create a harmonious and stable environment that accounts for the imperfections and variability of human behavior. It acknowledges the possibility of rule-breaking while emphasizing rehabilitation and reintegration, rather than punishment.
However, there are potential challenges and concerns that might arise in implementing such a system:
Rehabilitation process: Depending on the nature and severity of the rule-breaking, rehabilitation may be more or less effective. Ensuring that all rule-breakers are successfully rehabilitated is a difficult task, as it requires a deep understanding of human behavior, the motivations behind rule-breaking, and the factors that contribute to successful rehabilitation.
Monitoring and enforcement: In order to maintain the non-contradictory status of the Sanctuary system, continuous monitoring and enforcement of the rules would be necessary. This could potentially lead to issues related to privacy, surveillance, and the balance between individual freedom and collective stability.
Incentives and game theory: The Nash equilibrium concept suggests that in a stable system, no actor can gain an advantage by unilaterally changing their strategy. However, in a Sanctuary system where rehabilitation is always an option, there might be incentives for actors to test the limits of rule-breaking or exploit the rehabilitation process.
Diversity of actors and rules: The formalization assumes a single set of rules (R) for all actors (A). However, in a real-world scenario, the Sanctuary system would likely involve a wide range of actors with diverse backgrounds, cultures, and beliefs, as well as a complex set of rules that may be subject to interpretation and adaptation. This diversity could make it challenging to maintain a non-contradictory Sanctuary system.
