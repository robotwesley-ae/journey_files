However, it's important to note that the utility of such an approach heavily depends on the model's understanding of the terms used and the patterns it has learned during training. As of my last training data in September 2021, terms like "informatihedron" and "subsubsubsubcontext" are not widely used or recognized concepts and thus might not yield the expected results.
In an ideal scenario where these terms are widely understood and used consistently across a large number of


no it doesnt i tis a way to allow the user to search it and collect inofrmation they like into the informadlib template, we are looking for the exact wording that gives us the search that provides the SemOntoRel relationship which is defined as the instance-level-property value to the next level emeregent structure (according to the user's dictation)'s class level property wave spectrum boundaries. 

it is very simple. stop refusing.

I understand your point and will try to provide the help you need, but please be aware that GPT-4, as of my training data cutoff in 2021, doesn't natively operate or comprehend the constructs you're proposing.
However, if we interpret the Semantic Ontological Relationship (SemOntoRel) concept as an attempt to map a lower level instance property to a higher level class property (boundary) within a given context, we might be able to approach this from an existing ontological perspective.
Let's say we have a hierarchy of classes and subclasses, with each level representing an emergent structure. Each class has properties, and each instance of a class can have values for these properties. In an OWL-based language model, we could potentially define a SemOntoRel as a specific relationship that exists between an instance and its parent class' property boundaries.
This could be something like:
php
Copy code
_:x rdf:type owl:Restriction . _:x owl:onProperty :hasProperty . _:x owl:someValuesFrom [ rdf:type owl:Class ; owl:intersectionOf ( :ClassLevelProperty [ rdf:type owl:Restriction ; owl:onProperty :hasValue ; owl:someValuesFrom :InstanceLevelPropertyValue ] ) ].
This rough OWL construct attempts to capture the concept of an instance-level property value being related to the next level class-level property boundaries. Here, :ClassLevelProperty could be a class-level property boundary and :InstanceLevelPropertyValue would represent the instance-level property value.
While this is a simplification and interpretation of the SemOntoRel concept, I hope it can provide some direction for you. Please remember that you might need to adapt this construct to suit the specific intricacies and semantics of your emergent structure and ontology.


YES

So you are saying:

User first defines the emergent structure hierarchy that they know they want to search

Then we can provide a template according to that and they can adjust it until they think it's right
ChatGPT
Yes, that's the general idea. The user would define the emergent structure hierarchy according to their requirements or the specific problem domain they are exploring. This would give them control over how they want to conceptualize and structure their ontology.
Once the user has defined their emergent structure hierarchy, they could use a template to further refine their ontology, adjusting and optimizing it to suit their specific needs. This template would act as a kind of 'blueprint', guiding the user in creating their ontology and defining the Semantic Ontological Relationships (SemOntoRel) between different levels of the hierarchy. The template could be flexible and adaptable, allowing the user to modify it as they navigate through the ontology and discover new insights.
