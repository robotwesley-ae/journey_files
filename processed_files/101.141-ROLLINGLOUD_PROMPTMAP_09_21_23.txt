Kevin's mind is a jumbled mess as he tries to come up with a plan, but the effects of the drug are overpowering. The world around him morphs into a hallucinatory whirlwind of colors and shapes. Giant chickens parade by, talking trees share mysterious whispers, and unicorns prance, leaving trails of glitter in their wake.
Suddenly, his wife's voice booms in his head, taking the form of a deep sea creature with tentacles that wrap around his thoughts. She scolds him for getting into this mess, reminding him of his responsibilities as a father and husband. But Kevin's scattered mind struggles to grasp her words, as every thought quickly transforms into something entirely different.
The swirling kaleidoscope of his hallucinations overwhelms him, leaving him disoriented and confused. He tries to regain his focus, but the ever-shifting imagery makes it impossible to concentrate on anything for long.
In the midst of the chaos, Chad's face lights up with an idea. He grabs a glow stick, daringly places it in his butt, and takes off running, screaming maniacally. Linda, caught up in the frenzy, joins him, wildly dancing and proclaiming her love for Playboi Carti.
The security guards are taken aback by their bizarre antics, momentarily distracted from their duties. Kevin seizes the opportunity and sneaks past them, making his way into the artists-only area.
Feeling lost and alone amidst the pandemonium of the exclusive section, Kevin slinks off to the side, hoping for a stroke of luck. Suddenly, a tap on his shoulder startles him. He turns around to see Shenseea, the Jamaican artist he had encountered earlier, wearing a mischievous grin.
Meanwhile, the security guards have finally decided to intervene, tackling Chad and Linda to the ground. In the midst of the scuffle, the glowstick becomes dislodged, causing Chad to scream in pain and embarrassment. Despite the consequences of their wild behavior, they have successfully bought Kevin enough time to search for Zion.
The scene fades out as Kevin, with a mix of determination and trepidation, follows Shenseea into the unknown, ready to face whatever challenges lie ahead in his quest to find his son.
