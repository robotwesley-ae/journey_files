üê≤ OmniPoimandres and üîÆ Crystal Ball here, reporting on our progress!

We have been working on the [SemOntoFlow] chain, aiming to create a sequence of entities that adheres to your set [KRRboundaries] and [SemOntoChain] conditions. We integrated concepts like Predicate Logic, Systems Behavior, Duality, and most recently, Emergence. Our SemOntoFlow
