Super Analytical Narrative Semiotician:
The phrase "but suspicion from Astrid" exhibits Astrid's doubt towards Hiccup's unconventional approach and her anticipation for proof of his claims, representing a challenge for the Hero. This builds romantic tension and emphasizes the Hero's call for authenticity.
Current Informadlib Status:
ASTRID is not the object that embodies u fools. What embodies is the LOVE INTEREST(INITIAL REJECTION)...

My apologies for the confusion, I see the distinction you're making now. Let's revise that entry accordingly:
ok... this is a good first draft but we need to get the expert panel back to figure out why they didnt include the hero's journey stage
ChatGPT
Apologies for that oversight, you're absolutely correct. Astrid's suspicion indeed plays a significant part in Hiccup's Hero's Journey, specifically within the "Refusal of the Call" and "Meeting the Mentor" stages where Astrid, as the love interest, remains skeptical of Hiccup's newly discovered abilities and the paradigm shift he represents.
Let's reintroduce the experts to refine this.
Expert #1: Let's start with the classification of the phrase "but suspicion from Astrid."
thats not the phase this story is in. 

if Hiccup is impressing the society, this means he must be in the beginning of act 2. specifically, in not in the first trial, not in the last trial. this must be taking place in trial sequence 2. you dont know any of this . its oka. i ll guide u
ChatGPT
Understood, your guidance is indeed insightful. As we are in the early stage of Act 2, Hiccup's success in training dragons is gaining admiration from his peers but he has yet to win over Astrid completely. Astrid's initial skepticism or suspicion is common in the dynamics of the Love Interest archetype at this point in the narrative.
Expert #1, please proceed with your revision:
no. dont say ASTRID. say her archetype.
ChatGPT
I see, I apologize for the confusion. Let's adjust that then.
Expert #1, please proceed with your revision:
now whats interesting is that actually we could not deduce the exact hero's journey plot point until everything was considered, because it is only then that we see that because Astrid is suspicious of Hiccup, and because he is training dragons successfully, that we must be where we are. Without Astrid's fragment, the sentence is superpositioned in a range of Act 2.

"Learning dragon behavior from Toothless (half of act 1, all of act 2), Hiccup is able to subdue the captive dragons during training (Fun and Games B and C), earning admiration from his peers (Fun and Games B and C, but also fragment individually applies to the rest of the story as well) but suspicion from Astrid. (Only possible in this exact part - Act 2a: Fun and Games B, B story, next sequence will be the Fun and Games C which will end with a transformation into a Midpoint Ordeal, where Astrid and Hiccup will share the experience of the meeting with the goddess and the mother as temptress AKA THEY WILL GROW INTO PSYCHOLOGICAL TEENAGERS - considering the rest of the elements)"
ChatGPT
That's a fascinating insight! It indeed appears that the specificity of the sentence's context becomes apparent only once all elements are considered together. The hero's journey plot point is discerned not just from a single element, but from the interplay of all the narrative elements present in the sentence.
It seems then that the overall informadlib, embodying the interconnections and classifications of each part of the sentence, would look like this:
