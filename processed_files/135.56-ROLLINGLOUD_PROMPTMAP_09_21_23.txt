Something really fun and crazy needs to happen after this, before he finds Zion: "Shenseea takes one look at Jeremy's Rolling Loud outfit and bursts out laughing.

This needs to be an act 2B set piece type scene that could be used in the movie trailer and ultimately ends on a downbeat

Shenseea and her friends invite Jeremy to join them at their VIP table, and he reluctantly agrees, hoping to find some information about Zion. As they make their way through the crowd, they attract attention with their wild dance moves and loud laughter.
Jeremy is pulled into the group, and soon they're all dancing and singing along to the music. Shenseea even hands Jeremy a microphone and encourages him to sing along to one of her songs.
At first, Jeremy is hesitant, but he soon gets into the groove and starts belting out the lyrics. The crowd around them grows, and soon they're surrounded by hundreds of festival-goers, all cheering and singing along.
But just as the party is reaching its peak, security arrives, breaking up the fun. They accuse the group of causing a disturbance and threaten to escort them out of VIP.
Shenseea and her friends argue with security, but it's no use. They're forced to leave the VIP section and head back into the chaos of the festival.
Jeremy is disappointed, feeling like he's back to square one in his search for Zion. He says goodbye to Shenseea and her friends, thanking them for the fun night but feeling empty and alone once again.
As he wanders through the festival, searching for any sign of his son, he can't help but think back to the party with Shenseea and wonder if he'll ever find Zion.
