Rewrite the following, but now infuse a little more of the weed mixing with the other drugs getting into Kevin's system and add that Shensee is now sitting on his lap: Playboi nods sympathetically. "I feel you, man." Just then, his phone starts ringing. He looks at the caller ID and sees that it's his wife. "I'm not going to answer," he mutters, but Playboi lectures him about how you "always answer the wife." Feeling pressured, Kevin answers the call, and his wife tells him she's parking and walking towards the entrance. He quickly ends the call, feeling even more stressed than before.

Kevin is feeling the weight of his mistakes. He's under the influence, his head pounding with a massive headache, and he's feeling more alone than ever. Kevin reflects on his shortcomings as a father. He realizes that he's been too overprotective of Zion, trying to control his every move and decision. He's never given his son the space and freedom to make mistakes and learn from them. Kevin begins to see that he needs to loosen up and trust Zion to make his own choices, even if they're not always the right ones.

As Kevin contemplates his mistakes, he suddenly feels a weight on his lap. He looks down to see Shenseea sitting there, her eyes twinkling mischievously. "You look like you could use a little company," she says, handing him a joint.
Kevin hesitates for a moment, but the drugs have already taken hold of his system. He takes a hit, feeling the mix of weed and other substances swirling around in his head. He's barely aware of Shenseea as she starts to flirt with him, telling him how impressed she was with his dance moves earlier.
Kevin can't keep his mind focused on her words, though. He's still thinking about his son and where he could be. The security guards are closing in on him, and his wife is on her way. He's running out of time.
But as he takes another hit, he suddenly feels a surge of determination. He's going to find Zion, no matter what it takes. He's going to be the dad that his son needs, the one who supports him no matter what.
Shenseea gives him a kiss on the cheek as he stands up, feeling a renewed sense of purpose. He's going to face the security guards head-on and search every inch of the festival until he finds his son.
As he walks away, he can hear Shenseea laughing behind him. But he doesn't care. He's on a mission, and nothing is going to stand in his way.
