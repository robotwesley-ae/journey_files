Firstly abstracts any perceived phenomena as emergents in a way that blends reality with ideas such that the observer cannot know outside a priori. This can then be traced or collapsed back into its original state, whereupon the observer will have complete knowledge of the system of the emergent observed, including the observerâ€™s role in the system.
Thank you for providing a clearer explanation of the concept of "Abstract emergent ideorealistic combinatorial constructivism." Based on your description, this framework emphasizes the following aspects:
Abstraction of perceived phenomena: The observer recognizes and interprets emergent properties in a way that combines both reality and ideas. This process acknowledges the limitations of the observer's knowledge, which is constrained by their subjective experience and inability to access external a priori information.
Tracing or collapsing back to the original state: The observer attempts to deconstruct the abstracted emergent properties and trace them back to their original state within the system. This process may involve examining the interactions between components or the underlying mechanisms that give rise to the emergent properties.
Complete knowledge of the system: By tracing the emergent properties back to their original state, the observer aims to gain a comprehensive understanding of the system, including their own role in shaping the perception and interpretation of the emergent phenomena.
This framework highlights the active role of the observer in interpreting and understanding emergent properties, acknowledging the limitations of subjective experience while also striving to gain a more complete understanding of the system under study. It also emphasizes the interconnectedness of the observer, the emergent properties, and the underlying system, recognizing that knowledge and perception are shaped by this complex interplay.

Now whenever an observer creates an abstraction to think about an emergent as it relates to them, this is called a hallucination because the domain knowledge boundary is fuzzy. It can be arbitrarily close or far in the concept space.
In the context of your explanation, the term "hallucination" seems to refer to the process by which an observer creates an abstraction to think about an emergent as it relates to them. The term may be used to emphasize that the abstraction is not an objective or definitive representation of the emergent property, but rather a subjective mental construct that is influenced by the observer's personal experiences, perceptions, and cognitive processes.
The notion of a fuzzy domain knowledge boundary suggests that the scope of the abstraction can vary considerably in the concept space, as it is not constrained by a fixed or precise limit. This flexibility allows the observer to explore various degrees of proximity or distance from the emergent property, as well as to consider different perspectives and interpretations.
However, it is important to note that using the term "hallucination" in this context may lead to potential misunderstandings, as the word typically refers to a false perception or experience that occurs in the absence of external stimuli. In your explanation, the term appears to be used metaphorically to emphasize the subjective nature of the abstraction, but it might be helpful to clarify this point or use an alternative term to avoid confusion.

The abstractions exists incorrectly in an ontology, we are hallucinating what it is.
I understand your point now. You are using the term "hallucination" to emphasize that the abstractions we create for emergent properties exist incorrectly or inaccurately in our mental ontologies. These abstractions may not fully or precisely represent the actual emergent properties, as they are influenced by our subjective experiences, perceptions, and cognitive processes.
