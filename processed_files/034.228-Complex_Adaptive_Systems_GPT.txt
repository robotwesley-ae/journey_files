Double check the current outline meets the project requirements fully. then proceed to the next level of granularity, starting at the first step that needs to be expanded further. expand the granularities of that step and subsequent steps using your entire output space, going into as many stages, steps, and levels of granularity fit in the space. If nothing is changing from before, just indicate that with == at the start of the output. indicate * for something saved from before that we dont need to say, and just make the changes in between *'s, according to the instructions earlier in this prompt. Again, to be clear, you dont need to repeat parts that you arent changing. For example: if you said *3.2.2.2, 3.3, 3.3.1, *3.3.1.1, it could have been *3.2.2.2,*3.3.1.1... 
Make sure the outline stays formatted correctly and well structured for clarity.
