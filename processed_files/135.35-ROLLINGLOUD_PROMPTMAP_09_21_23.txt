Jeremy is taken aback. He's never been propositioned like this before, and he's not sure how to respond. Chad, on the other hand, seems unfazed.
"Sounds like a good idea to me," he says with a grin.
Jeremy hesitates. He's married, and he doesn't want to do anything that would jeopardize his relationship. But at the same time, he's feeling a little bit reckless tonight, and he's not sure if he'll get another chance to let loose like this.
Just as he's about to make a decision, his phone buzzes again. It's another message from his wife, this time asking if he's found Zion yet.
The message jolts him back to reality. He can't lose sight of what's important. He politely declines the girls' invitation and tells Chad that they should keep searching for Zion.
Chad seems disappointed, but he understands. As they leave the VIP section, Jeremy can't help but feel a little bit relieved. He knows that he made the right choice, but a small part of him wonders what could have happened if he had said yes to the girls' invitation.

Chad and Jeremy are now in the VIP section, having another drink. Two girls approach them and ask if the seats next to them are taken. The girls are clearly drunk and very flirty. One of them recognizes Jeremy from dancing on stage.
As the girls start flirting with them, Jeremy's phone suddenly rings. He quickly checks the caller ID, hoping it's Zion, but it's his wife instead.
"Hey, how's it going?" his wife asks.
"Uh, good, good," Jeremy stammers, trying to sound casual while the girls giggle in the background. "Just hanging out with some old friends from high school."
"Old friends from high school? That sounds nice," his wife says, sounding skeptical. "How's Zion doing? Did you guys see Lil Uzi Vert?"
"Uh, yeah, yeah, we saw him," Jeremy lies, feeling guilty. "Zion's doing great. He's just hanging out with some kids he met earlier. He's having a blast."
"That's great to hear," his wife says, sounding relieved. "Just make sure you keep an eye on him, okay? And be safe."
"Will do," Jeremy says, trying to sound confident.
As he hangs up the phone, he turns back to the girls, hoping to pick up where they left off. But now he feels even more anxious, knowing that he has to find Zion before his wife finds out that he lost him.
