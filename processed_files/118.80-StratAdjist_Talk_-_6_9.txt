[SemOntoRel] (Semantic Ontological Relationship): SemOntoRel is a structured, formalized representation of the semantic and ontological relationships within the EWSO. It encapsulates the dynamic progression of instance-level entities through various hierarchical layers of classes to high-level superclasses within a given conceptual model. Each transition between the layers represents a specific action or effect, encapsulating the transformation of values from instance-level to class-level conceptual value boundaries within a recognizable and structured manner. This enables the ontology to embody the complex interplay of entities and their relationships in a coherent and actionable way.""
"Conversation Context:

User as Ontology Creator: I am establishing an ontology with the following classes and transitions: A: 'InstanceLevel1', B: 'InstanceLevel2', C: 'ClassLevel1', D: 'ClassLevel2', α: 'maps from InstanceLevel1 to InstanceLevel2', β: 'maps from InstanceLevel2 to ClassLevel1'. The transition domains and ranges are: 1: 'InstanceLevel1', 2: 'InstanceLevel2', 3: 'InstanceLevel2', 4: 'ClassLevel1'. The value property of InstanceLevel1 is denoted by P and its maximum value is Q: 'maxValue'. The specific transition rule for InstanceLevel1 is denoted by R with a rule S: 'specificRule'. I now provide the following NL descriptions: x: 'NL description of input property x', y: 'NL description of input property y'.

User as Informadlib Generator: Given the above ontology and descriptions, please generate the corresponding Informadlib.

AI as Informadlib Generator: Given your inputs, an Informadlib corresponding to the provided ontology and NL descriptions can be generated as follows..."

AI Kruskal-Szkeres, Theoretical Physicist (in metaphorical use): Adapting these concepts to a Kruskal-Szkeres coordinate system is an exciting idea. This system can provide a framework for visualizing and traversing the multidimensional knowledge space as represented by the EWSO and its associated entities.
Event Horizon (Coordinate Singularity): The event horizon in this knowledge space could be represented as the transition between what we know (the observable, well-mapped parts of the EWSO) and what we don't know (the yet-to-be-explored, mysterious, or challenging parts of the EWSO). In the context of Informadlibs, the event horizon might be the point at which a given template no longer provides an adequate description, and new information or a new model is needed.
Black Holes (Knowledge Absorption): In our metaphorical context, black holes could be represented as areas of the EWSO where information is absorbed but not emitted. They might correspond to concepts, topics, or areas that are not well understood or have not been adequately explored. This could be represented in the Informadlib as missing or incomplete information, possibly due to lack of data or a poor fit with the current template.
White Holes (Knowledge Emission): White holes could be the Nexus nodes in our system. These would be well-understood, often-explored areas of the EWSO that constantly emit information and provide clarity and guidance in our traversal. These could correspond to well-defined, rich parts of the Informadlib that, due to high quality data or fitting well with the template, can inform and illuminate other parts of the ontology.
Wormholes (Shortcuts through Knowledge Space): In the context of the EWSO, wormholes could be seen as shortcuts or links between seemingly disparate areas of knowledge, allowing for quick traversal or leapfrogging across the space. In the Informadlib, these could be unexpected connections or insights that allow for innovative ways of understanding or representing the data.
