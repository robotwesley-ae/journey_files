EXT. ROLLING LOUD VENUE - VENUE - DAY
Chad crouches down, his hands gripping what appears to be a fire hydrant or an industrial-sized water source. His determined expression is mixed with a touch of excitement.
CHAD (steadily unscrewing) Almost there, guys. Just a little more.
Kevin, his wet clothes clinging to his body, looks at Chad with concern.
KEVIN (nervously) Are you sure about this, Chad? I mean, won't it cause any problems?
Chad glances at Kevin, his eyes gleaming with confidence.
CHAD (grinning) Trust me, Kev. We just need to give it a little twist, and it'll be like a refreshing cold shower.
As the suspense builds, the tension reaches its peak. Suddenly, with a forceful jolt, the METAL CAP bursts off the hydrant, colliding with Kevin's forehead. He winces in pain as water erupts from the opened valve, shooting upward like a majestic geyser.
The sheer force of the unleashed water overwhelms the surroundings, flooding a vast expanse of the festival grounds. Chaos ensues as festival-goers scramble to higher ground, their laughter mixing with shouts of surprise and exhilaration.

Kevin, a wide grin spreading across his face, glances back at the scene of controlled mayhem.
KEVIN (laughing) Well, that escalated quickly!
Chad, his clothes dripping wet, chuckles in agreement.
CHAD (gleefully) I guess we've made quite the splash, haven't we?
Linda, her wet hair clinging to her face, joins in their laughter, reveling in the absurdity of the situation.
LINDA (raising her voice above the commotion) Let's keep moving, guys! We're clean and free. No turning back now!
With newfound energy and a sense of adventure, the trio continues their journey through the festival grounds, leaving behind a trail of water and a memory that will be talked about for years to come.
