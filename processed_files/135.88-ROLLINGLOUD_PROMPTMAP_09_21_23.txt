Just let us through, Ty. You can have fun with him later, any way you want.

KEVIN
(horrified)

BURLY BODYGUARD
(eager)
Really? Any way I want?

KEVIN
(terrified)
No!

SHENSEEA
(flippant)
Yes.

BURLY BODYGUARD
Can I bring Big Mac & Lil' M?

KEVIN
(desperate)
No!

SHENSEEA
(teasing)
Absolutely.

The bodyguard drops Kevin with a THUD and reluctantly allows them entry.

Rewrite the following scene in the tone and style of TODD PHILLIPS: INT. PLAYBUS - CONTINUOUS The smoke-filled Playbus pulses with energy as Kevin and Shenseea navigate through the dimly lit space. They pass rappers and women, their presence a mere blur in Kevin's disoriented state. He can feel the weight of desperation sinking deeper within him. Finally, they reach the back of the bus, where Playboi Carti and his entourage are gathered. Kevin's heart skips a beat, hoping against hope that Zion might be among them. Shenseea takes the lead, engaging Playboi Carti in conversation while Kevin anxiously surveys the scene. PLAYBOI CARTI (smirking) So, you're looking for your kid, huh? What are you willing to do to find him? Kevin's anxiety intensifies, but he knows he can't back down now. KEVIN (resolute) Anything. Just tell me where he is. Playboi Carti chuckles, clearly enjoying Kevin's discomfort. PLAYBOI CARTI Alright, let's have some fun. You wanna know? You gotta prove yourself. Kevin's face flushes with a mix of embarrassment and determination. He's ready to endure whatever it takes to get information about his son. The tasks begin. Kevin eats a scorching-hot chili pepper, barks like a dog, utters embarrassingly silly phrases, and attempts to rap along with Playboi Carti. Laughter echoes through the bus as Kevin embraces the absurdity of the moment. PLAYBOI CARTI (laughing) You're a good sport, man. But unfortunately, Zion's not here. Kevin's heart sinks, his hopes shattered. Yet, something unexpected transpires. Playboi Carti and the others on the bus develop a newfound respect for Kevin's determination. PLAYBOI CARTI (laughs) You've earned our respect, man. We'll help you find your son. Kevin's despair is momentarily replaced with a glimmer of hope. Perhaps with their assistance, he can locate Zion after all. As Kevin fumbles with his phone to show Playboi Carti the photo, a new message from the two girls he met earlier accidentally appears on the screen. Playboi Carti catches a glimpse of the racy photo, eliciting laughter. PLAYBOI CARTI (laughing) Looks like you're having quite the adventure, huh? Kevin, flustered, quickly scrolls past the image. KEVIN (dismissing it) That's not important. My priority is finding my son. Playboi Carti nods empathetically. PLAYBOI CARTI I get it, man. Family comes first. Just then, Kevin's phone rings, displaying his wife's caller ID. Panic washes over him. KEVIN (muttering) I'm not going to answer. Playboi Carti intervenes, offering some unexpected advice. PLAYBOI CARTI (grinning) Always answer the wife, man. Trust me. Feeling pressured, Kevin answers the call, bracing himself for the forthcoming confrontation. His wife's voice fills his ears, conveying her location and determination. The conversation ends abruptly, leaving Kevin feeling even more overwhelmed. Despair consumes Kevin as he realizes the magnitude of his mistakes. He's lost his son in the midst of this chaotic festival, and uncertainty engulfs him. The weight of responsibility weighs heavily upon him, and the journey to find Zion feels more daunting than ever. Kevin takes a deep breath, determined to find strength amidst the chaos. The road ahead may be treacherous, but he'll do whatever it takes to reunite with his son.

Inside the smoky, pulsating heart of the PLAYBUS, KEVIN and SHENSEEA weave through the dim, chaotic space. The blurring silhouettes of rappers and women barely register in Kevin's spun-out haze. Desperation gnaws at his insides.

At last, they make it to the back where PLAYBOI CARTI and his crew are holding court. Kevin's heart lurches, scanning the faces for ZION. Shenseea steps forward, striking up a chat with Playboi Carti, while Kevin's eyes frantically survey the area.
