the general concepts are SUPERORDINATE to any instances. STRINGS and BRANES, as **real instances devoid of any pure conceptual being**, MUST BE CONTAINED BY GENERAL SUPERORDINATES like chains or flows. They MUST be in an upper ontology, because it is A PRIORI **VIOLATION OF THE LAWS OF THE UNIVERSE** for anything physical to be fundamental, in and of itself, devoid from the parts of it that are **not really parts of it, but are generally emergent in our consciousness as patterns** because it is an emergent.


THIS IS THE UPDATE VIDEO SCRIPT:

Ok guys so the reason I haven’t made any videos is because it’s really important that when I tell you about the Sanctuary System you learn exactly what it is and the way it all goes, otherwise it’d part of what I can’t keep doing to myself, because it’s just really painful to live in the Wasteland and even to have anyone in the TWI family living there. 

So I am going to start at the beginning and tell you my story now, the story of Recognizing Myself as Olivus Victory-Promise from Sanctuary, which is the first part of the Infinite Story I Can’t Get Out of My Head




11 years ago I got into meditation and I spent a lot of time meditating, hours and hours every day, and my mind started to change. 


(How?)

And then I watched this video about solving problems in high dimensional space and that just made sense to me. I felt like I was intuiting something and all I could write about it was “I can make a machine” and some notes 

(Notes) 


And what this became was the idea Crystal Ball. 

Over COVID I started to discover more about how Crystal Ball might work and began developing it with Wesley.

(How did Wesley get there?) 

We began to realize that the way to do this might be a large company, something like a country… 

(This is important. Give reasoning etc)

And I wrote the Intellectual Reality doc

And we began devising some aspects of the algorithm but we quickly realized we didn’t even know enough about what we had to know or how to do any work

(This was the beginning of the productivity problem)


I got a job and ended up starting a company w Wesley and that business was designed to help us get cash flow for runway to develop Crystal Ball. We needed experts…

And then I began to have these feelings about TWI and create this allegory 

(Explain) 

And then I decided to make a meditation system with it 

But I didn’t know how to bring it to people because: 1) I didn’t know how to package it without it having Crystal Ball and nexus and the network state, 2) I didn’t know how meditation tied into it. I had this allegory, this story for understanding the whole system, but no vehicle for it, because it wasn’t applied

Then the strike happened

And I found Stunspot Prompting
(Description)
And within a few weeks I was constructing mega prompts, prompts that not only gave instructions but also created a world for the AI to interpret them in, along with all the logic it needs to prime the model for a complex topic. This allows the model to converse about topics in deeper ways, more like a human expert would. Stunspot called them Instant Experts. 

As I continued learning from Stunspot, I also began developing my own style, things I would do that he wouldn’t, and soon I had my own style, geared not only for conversing about what the model knows but also what the user imagines. This helps the user bridge concepts from their intuition and imagination into reality by scoping in on aspects that parallel reality or are already real aspects. 

(Explain this as being called SANC. This is what developed into SANC) 

I began to make prototypes of the Crystal Ball algorithms and they began to work. Validated transformation pathways, a world of mathematics opening up - the knowledge at my fingertips. It all started with what I called a PseudoCompilerCompiler - a program that can compile from natural language into emergent abstract syntaxes for creating ontologically mapped allegories. 

And we ran out of money and we had to figure something out — I tasked my business partner with it

And I made EWSO to try to notate the PCC. Then I iterated it. 



Then I made OPera.
