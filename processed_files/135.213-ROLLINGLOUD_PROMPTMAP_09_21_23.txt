Kevin chuckles, finding Chad's eccentricities both amusing and endearing.
KEVIN (shaking his head) You never cease to surprise me, Chad. But what brings you to Rolling Loud?
Chad's face lights up, and he leans in closer, speaking with enthusiasm.
CHAD (excitedly) Music, my friend! The energy, the vibes, the whole experience. It's like stepping into another world. And let's not forget the people-watching. It's a goldmine for interesting characters, just like us!
Kevin can't help but smile at Chad's genuine passion for the festival.
KEVIN (nodding) You're right, Chad. It's definitely a unique experience. I brought my son, Zion. He's always had a love for music, just like his old man.
Chad's eyes widen with curiosity, eager to learn more.
CHAD (enthusiastically) No way! That's awesome, Kevin. What kind of music is he into? Any favorite artists?
Kevin's face lights up as he shares Zion's musical tastes.
KEVIN (grinning) He's into hip-hop, especially the old-school stuff. You know, legends like Nas, Jay-Z, and Wu-Tang Clan. But he also appreciates the new school. He's a huge fan of Joey Bada$$, the artist performing today.
Chad nods with excitement, his enthusiasm matching Kevin's.
CHAD (raising his fist) Joey Bada$$! That's my jam too, man. It's gonna be an epic performance.
As their conversation continues, their energy builds, their shared memories and newfound common ground bringing them closer together. They laugh, reminisce, and exchange stories, enjoying the camaraderie that time and distance hadn't diminished.
Kevin's initial skepticism begins to fade, and he realizes that despite Chad's quirks, having him by his side at Rolling Loud might turn out to be a surprisingly memorable adventure.
Together, they continue their journey through the bustling festival, ready to immerse themselves in the music and create new memories.

Kevin stands in line, reviewing the menu, when the FOOD TRUCK GUY approaches.
FOOD TRUCK GUY (looking at Kevin) What can I get you?
Kevin is about to place his order when Chad interrupts, his grin widening.
CHAD (energetically) Oh, don't do that! You won't believe the culinary journey the chef of this vegan food truck has been on. I know all the best items on the menu. Let me order for you!
Kevin hesitates, glancing at the extensive list of options on the menu.
KEVIN (uncertain) I'm not sure, Chad. I don't want to order too much...

FOOD TRUCK GUY (slightly amused) That's quite the order. Are you sure you can handle all of that?
Chad chuckles, his confidence unwavering.
CHAD (with a playful grin) Oh, don't worry about us. We're seasoned festival-goers. We know how to conquer the food scene.
Kevin tries to interject, wanting to scale back the order, but Chad cuts him off.
