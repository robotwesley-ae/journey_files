KEVIN AND PLAYBOI "Go and get your racks, go and get your bands. I told my mom I'm gonna be the man..." EXT. FESTIVAL GROUNDS - CONTINUOUS Zion cuts a determined path through the pulsating crowd.

ZION Excuse me! Excuse me! The lunatic dancers turn to Zion. It’s Chad and Linda. They look crazed. CHAD Back off, kid! That’s our best friend up there. Overwhelmed, he gazes up at his dad, completely transfixed. ZION (yelling, pointing) That's my Dad! LINDA AND CHAD ZION!!!!! They immediately start hugging and grabbing him out of excitement. Zion is a little creeped out, but then they all start yelling.... ZION DAD!!!!!!!! LINDA AND CHAD KEVIN!!!!!!! ON STAGE - CONTINUOUS Kevin and Playboi Carti are setting the stage ablaze. PLAYBOI CARTI & KEVIN (on stage, singing) "I told my boy, go on like ten blunts for me. I told my boy, go on, get bands for me..." Out of nowhere, Kevin does a backflip. As the crowd roars, Kevin's eyes scan the sea of faces, hearing -- ZION (screaming, overjoyed) Dad!!!!!! And then, they land on Zion, flanked by Chad and Linda. Time seems to slow as father and son lock eyes. ZION (screaming, overjoyed) GO DAD!!! ON STAGE - CONTINUOUS Kevin, hearing his son's yell over the cacophony, reacts instantly. He drops the mic, takes a running start, and then he's airborne, diving into the crowd. EXT. FESTIVAL GROUNDS - FRONT OF THE STAGE Kevin lands among the crowd, right next to Zion. The two embrace, their reunion engulfed in a thunderous cheer. KEVIN I get it. I get that you ran off and didn’t want to be with your dad. ZION I didn’t run off. I came to find you right where you said and your weren’t there. Then I texted you saying I ran into my friends. Is it okay if I hang with you and then I got your text that said “something that was meant for Melanie.” So I thought you didn’t want to mosh with me, because you hated this music so much. KEVIN No....that was meant for your mom... about the movie...I’m sorry. And the music’s growing on me. Playboi Carti sees Kevin and Zion, points over and smiles... And then, they jump into the mosh pit, their joyous celebration echoed in the music and the night...
