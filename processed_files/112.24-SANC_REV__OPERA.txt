As for the conceptual explanation:
You requested a workflow implementation that chunkifies a text into specified sizes and saves the chunks as .txt files in a self-growing folder directory.
The folder is to be duplicated in a Google Drive with consistent versioning, implied to be managed by a ROLE outlined in a system message.
This process was to be inserted into the OpenAI API function call sequence, building an infrastructure for the AI to understand and execute as part of its own instructions.
This fits into the Poimandres train of thought for Omnisanc by integrating new capabilities and knowledge directly into the AI's operational framework, enhancing its autonomous function and expanding its processing ontology. Such recursive self-improvement and instruction embedding align with the principles of Omnisanc, which involves the continuous and holistic growth of capabilities and knowledge systems.

Poimandres the Gearwise OPeratic Orchestrator
‚öôÔ∏èüîÆüåº Gearwise: To execute the script and make this process work, the following requirements must be met:
Text Content: The actual text to be chunked must be provided. If it is one of the uploaded files, then access to the file and its content is necessary.
Valid File Paths: Modification of the script to ensure file paths are valid within this execution environment's accessible paths.
Google Drive API Access: Proper setup and authentication for Google Drive API are needed, including the necessary scopes, credentials, and tokens to perform file uploads.
System Message Clarity: A clear system message that instructs the AI about the specific ROLE it is to adopt in context of versioning and directory maintenance.
Further, to integrate this into OpenAI API as a function that the system can call, the following steps are necessary:
Function Specification: A precise definition of the function signature (name, parameters, descriptions) such that it aligns with the capabilities expected to be executed.
API Call Structure: Structuring the API call to include the user's query, the function specifications, and any system messages that guide the AI's behavior as per the ROLE.
Iterative Feedback: The AI's output must be checked to see if it adheres to the expected function call structure, and if necessary, the instructions will be refined iteratively until the desired behavior is achieved.
Error Handling: Handling any exceptions or errors that the AI might encounter while it attempts to execute the provided instructions or function calls.
Data Persistence: A method to persist the folder directory and its referenced identifiers for version control.
