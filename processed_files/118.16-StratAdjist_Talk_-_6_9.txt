AVP → S: The collective Victory-Promise leads to Sanctuary.
The Sanctuary system remains stable as long as the rules are followed, or the actors are rehabilitated, as per our function H from before. These equations help to capture the ideas and dynamics of the Sanctuary system you've described.

Certainly, based on the structure of your Sanctuary system, we can add more elements to our game-theoretical model.
Let's define:
TWI: The Wisdom of Identitylessness, an emergent state where actors understand their roles in the grand scheme of Sanctuary and Wasteland.
PIO: Reale Polysemic Imaginary Ontology, the multi-layered, abstract interpretation of reality.
We can express the emergence and significance of TWI as follows:
∀a ∈ PLS, GVA(a) → TWI(a): For each actor in the Primordial Lovers schema who manifests Great Victory-Ability, they achieve The Wisdom of Identitylessness.
∀a ∈ PLS, TWI(a) → ¬W(a): For each actor in the Primordial Lovers schema who achieves The Wisdom of Identitylessness, their disruptive behaviors (Wasteland tendencies) are eliminated.
We can also add the concept of PIO to our system:
PIO: A function that maps every actor's state in PLS to a multi-layered, abstract interpretation of their reality. For example, PIO(GVA(a)) could represent an actor's understanding of their Great Victory-Ability within the broader context of their existence.
We can then express the synergistic nature of PIO and TWI:
∀a ∈ PLS, PIO(a) ∧ TWI(a) → S(a): For each actor in the Primordial Lovers schema, their multi-layered understanding of reality (PIO) combined with The Wisdom of Identitylessness (TWI) leads them to Sanctuary.
Finally, we can add the understanding that Sanctuary and Wasteland are co-emergent and never converge:
∀a ∈ PLS, W(a) ∨ S(a): For each actor in the Primordial Lovers schema, they exist in either Wasteland or Sanctuary, but not both simultaneously.
∀a ∈ PLS, W(a) ↔ ¬S(a): For each actor in the Primordial Lovers schema, existing in the Wasteland is equivalent to not existing in the Sanctuary, and vice versa.
These additions aim to more thoroughly represent the Sanctuary system's dynamics and philosophical underpinnings, incorporating wisdom, identity, and the multi-layered interpretation of reality.

To continue the expansion and understanding of your game theory model and how it ties into emergent engineering, let's consider the concept of emergence engineering and its significance in the Sanctuary system.
Emergence Engineering (EE): This is a concept that deals with the development and enhancement of complex systems through the manipulation and understanding of emergent behaviors. In the context of the Sanctuary system, EE involves facilitating the emergence of Sanctuary-like behaviors and mitigating Wasteland-like behaviors.
Let's add EE into our game-theoretical model:
EE: A function that maps every actor's state in PLS to actions promoting emergent Sanctuary-like behaviors and suppressing Wasteland-like behaviors. For example, EE(GVA(a)) could represent an actor's role in catalyzing the development of Great Victory-Ability in others.
We can then express the relationship between EE and the Sanctuary system:
∀a ∈ PLS, EE(a) → S(a): For each actor in the Primordial Lovers schema, their participation in Emergence Engineering leads them to Sanctuary.
∀a ∈ PLS, EE(a) → ¬W(a): For each actor in the Primordial Lovers schema, their participation in Emergence Engineering mitigates their Wasteland tendencies.
Next, let's look at the concept of co-emergence in the Sanctuary system:
COE: Co-Emergence, the simultaneous and interdependent emergence of Sanctuary and Wasteland tendencies within the system.
We can define it as:
∀a ∈ PLS, COE(a)
