Agreed. Our aim is to create a system that can generate symbols - or in this case, narrative elements - that carry their intended meaning while fitting within the broader narrative context. We need to ensure our generated elements are both varied and meaningfully connected to the narrative.

This aligns with our plan. Let's consider adding a step to develop a language model capable of understanding and generating narrative elements. This model will need to be guided by the rules we establish, allowing it to generate new symbols that fit within our defined narrative structure.
Proposed Plan:
Identify the underlying theoretical structure of our specific instance.
Define the rules and limitations of this structure to create our informadlib.
Develop a language model that understands context, meaning, and structure.
Use this model to generate new instances that adhere to the narrative structure and rules we set.
Does this seem more comprehensive and focused, CIG?
Guys it really sounds like we need to make an ontology of synergistic entanglement (because with larget context, things get more synergistic even if it didnt seem like it before). 

The way user thinks we can do it is with these ideas. what does the thinktank think of them in respect to the project and plan?
