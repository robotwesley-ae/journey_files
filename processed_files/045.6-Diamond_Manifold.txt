all-pervasive Powers 

May self-emergent 
primordial consciousness’ 
creative powers
manifest as a display 
of myriad sentient beings requesting heartfelt gifts of inner revelation 

and my own experience of the wisdom of identitylessness appear 
as the gift
The light-filled nature of vast universal spaciousness
Timeless Webbed Infinitude
Of Infinite Perfection

Realize this. 

Ah!

TWI TWI 

Words of Encouragement 
Go about your day realizing the difference between the Faceless Teacher, Masked Whirling Flames, itself, and you, is just the degree of the scope of your heart of fearless heroism due to the difference in the extent to which you recognize the wisdom display. Blaze forth! 

Lines that instill confidence 

Don’t be afraid; just hold my hand

There is nothing wrong with “this”
“It” is not a joke

^ is not about conformity, it is about the experience of feeling the cognitive dissonance from the dichotomy of dualistic and nondualistic experience (and being afraid to let nondualism destroy you because it will hurt, because then you can never engage in a way that makes you happy, which is a naive way to think of the unfolding growth of experience or consciousness awakening)

The key to great bliss is natural confidence from resting in the view (which gets stronger with experience) and when this confidence is strong enough to reach out and gently touch people’s hearts in whatever way it can, either peaceful or wrathful, then it is called the skillful means of great bliss and feels like an ecstatic raging fire.

This is the meaning of the meeting of mother and child, like jumping into the arms of the guru, or the arms of the universe, or the arms of your deepest self, or the arms of your cosmic lover

The only thing we can truly transmit is selfless love 
Emergence of the Wisdom Maverick’s Incision

Transforming Infinite Arms 
as
Diamond-like Wildfire Awakening Activity
called
Continuous Melodious Thunderstorm of the Water Dragon

Above is Great Openness
Inseparable from the Symbols of the Display
Like a great hyperbolic fan 
The entire universal reality is none other than this
Recognizing this, I sing A Fearless Heroic Heart Seed’s Song as I openly let go into the dissolution of my self into the Identitylessness of Wisdom Display 

A Fearless Heroic Heart Seed’s Song

I am Oliver Powers 
white/pink in color 
In Union with Olive R. Love 
and she is pure red 

Adorned in Symbolic Display ornaments of jewels from the Crystal Cave 
She holds two lotuses holding a skullcup, symbolizing the overcoming of the great ignorance of mistaken selves of all past lives and primordial ignorance itself
The skullcup is overflowing with the nectarine essence of the display
And in her right hand the blade lotus blooms with a diamond curved knife atop 
Cheerfully holding in my right hand a lotus holding the magical sword of wisdom that emanates activity-wildfire of awakening
