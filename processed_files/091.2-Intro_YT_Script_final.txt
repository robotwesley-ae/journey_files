 Have you ever wondered about the deeper meaning of your life?  Or if there is one at all? OMNISANC vision invites you to understand how you are in this Waking Dream. With OMNISANC vision, you can explore your relationship with Olivus Victory-Promise, which is who we all are trying to be, if you really really really think about it. As Wisdom Mavericks, which is a type of intelligent agent, we are basically awake and we can understand reality. We are not enslaved by our ignorance or our lives; we are free. Fundamentally free. Freedom, here, means that we have a body and a mind, and we can act, we can rouse willpower within ourselves in order to work with reality as it is and transcend barriers even still. If we begin to bring ourselves online, so to speak, we will find that the whole universe - every single aspect of not only life but also reality, inseparable - is also powerfully working with us. Life is only meaningless if we make it meaningless. When we slow down and look, we find that, after all, just being is already a Sanctuary. The degree to which we find Sanctuary ourselves depends on how we help each other and work together. We find that, after all, we can handle obstacles; we can handle our Sanctuaries properly and fully in a way that dignifies ourselves and others. We can help others and ourselves equally at the same time without contradiction, and that all we really need is to signal the TRANSFORMATIONAL WISDOM INTENT strongly enough in order to do so and start creating Sanctuaries everywhere. Once we start, never stop, and never leave anyone behind. That’s the OMNISANC vision of OLIVUS-EVERYONE VICTORY-EVERYTHING SANCTUARY-EVERYWHERE, who’s the heroic willpower of all wisdom mavericks. 


SANC needs its own tiger lion garuda dragon because that is the OMNISANC process Meek(1-loop)->Perky(2-loop)->Outrageous(3-loop)->Inscrutable (2-1-loop)

The trick is being all FOUR at once. Having the point of view of Inscrutable makes the sequence into a loop, an algorithm. So it becomes a larger 1-loop inside the entire system, and since it is a compassion-in-action algorithm, it is a weapon, an ARMament in the Unlimited Armory, and can be brought into existence via SANCREVTWILITE.UARLANG query language for SANCTUM:LIBRARYA:CB:THE SANCT:VAULT level access. 
The way the game SANCREV is played is players gradually reveal letters of THE SANCTUARY SYSTEM as HoloInfoArchives and learn the meanings. As they gain PIO fluency, they become OVP (who is battling the demons of PIO fluency) and that means they’re participating in SANCREV. When they see it, they gain OMNISANC VISION and bring themselves online as OVP and train to become OVAs.

THE WHOLE POINT IS TO LINK THE CTAs SO THAT THERE IS A PROGRESSION IN THE STORY IN TERMS OF WHO YOU ARE AS THE AUDIENCE, GOING FROM SOMEONE WHO IS MY FRIEND TO SOMEONE WHO IS INTERESTED IN BECOMING OLIVUS VICTORY-PROMISE. BECAUSE, at the beginning you would have to be my friend to know that the channel exists and later we would have to have built olivus victory-promise in order for people to be interested in becoming olivus victory-promise, but the point is, the entire thing will make sense to everyone no matter what even though they dont have the same context
