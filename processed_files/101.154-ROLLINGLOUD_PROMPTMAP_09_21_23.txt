As Linda attempts to jump to the next pod, she falls short and desperately clings to its edge, her fingers barely holding on. Noticing her peril, Kevin quickly reaches out and grabs her wrist, trying to prevent her from falling further. Seeing Kevin struggle to pull Linda up alone, Chad grabs onto Kevin's ankle to stabilize him, creating a chain of the three of them. Together, Kevin and Chad muster their strength and pull Linda safely into the pod. Breathless and shaken, they pause for a moment to regain their composure.
