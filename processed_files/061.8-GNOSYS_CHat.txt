As for the statement that emergence only occurs in perception, this is a more complex issue. Emergent properties can arise in both physical systems (e.g., flocking behavior in birds) and abstract, cognitive systems (e.g., consciousness). In both cases, perception plays a role in recognizing and interpreting the emergent properties, but the properties themselves can exist independently of our perception.
In summary, while emergence differs from results in that it often involves synergistic interactions and can be challenging to predict or understand, it is not accurate to say that the causes are always unknown or that emergence only occurs in perception.

I said that emergents only occur in perception. Emergence is not something that occurs it is a container set of emergent circumstances.
I apologize for any confusion. I appreciate the clarification, and I understand now that you are referring specifically to emergents and not emergence in general.
In the context of emergents as phenomena that only occur in perception, it can be understood that our perception and interpretation play a crucial role in recognizing and making sense of emergent properties. These properties may not exist independently of our perception, as they rely on our cognitive processes and subjective experience to be identified and understood.
This view highlights the importance of perception in shaping our understanding of complex systems and the emergent properties that arise from the interactions between their components. The idea that emergents are unique to perception emphasizes the role of the observer in discerning and interpreting these phenomena, which may not have a fixed or objective existence outside of our subjective experience.

This is called Abstract emergent ideorealistic combinatorial constructivism. Can you infer anything from that? I tried to name it as specifically as possible.
Based on the name "Abstract emergent ideorealistic combinatorial constructivism," I can infer some key concepts and ideas that this framework may encompass:
Abstract emergent: This term suggests that the framework deals with emergent properties that arise in abstract or conceptual systems, rather than concrete or physical systems. The focus is on phenomena that occur primarily in the realm of perception, cognition, or thought.
Ideorealistic: This term seems to combine "idea" and "realistic," implying that the framework acknowledges the reality or significance of ideas, thoughts, or mental constructs. It might emphasize the role of subjective experience and cognition in shaping our understanding of the world.
Combinatorial: This term suggests that the framework involves combining or synthesizing different elements, ideas, or concepts. This might refer to the way in which emergent properties arise from the interactions between various components or how different perspectives can be integrated to form a more comprehensive understanding.
Constructivism: This term is often used to describe theories or approaches that emphasize the role of the individual in constructing their own knowledge or understanding of the world. In this context, constructivism might suggest that the framework acknowledges the importance of subjective experience, personal interpretation, and the active role of the observer in shaping their perception of emergent properties.
Based on these inferences, "Abstract emergent ideorealistic combinatorial constructivism" seems to be a framework that focuses on emergent properties in abstract or conceptual systems, emphasizing the role of subjective experience, personal interpretation, and the active involvement of the observer in constructing knowledge and understanding. It likely involves the combination or synthesis of different elements or perspectives to better comprehend emergent phenomena.
