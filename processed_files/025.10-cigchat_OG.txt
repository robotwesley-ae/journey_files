Semiotics studies signs and symbols and their use or interpretation. We could benefit from considering each element of the informadlib as a 'sign' that represents a certain concept or piece of information. The key is understanding how these signs are related and how they can be combined to convey different meanings. This could provide a valuable perspective when trying to develop an index of terms and their relationships.
Expert 4: Ontology Architect
An ontology defines a common vocabulary for researchers who need to share information in a domain. It includes machine-interpretable definitions of basic concepts and the relationships among them. Thus, an ontological approach to the informadlib might involve defining a comprehensive set of terms and relationships that encompass all the information we're interested in. This ontology could then serve as a 'map' for navigating the informadlib and searching for specific information.
Expert 5: AI Specialist
An AI perspective would involve using machine learning and other algorithms to automate and optimize the process of searching and interpreting the informadlib. This could involve training a model on a large dataset of informadlibs to learn patterns and relationships among different elements. The AI could then use this knowledge to generate new informadlibs, answer specific queries, or even predict future trends or patterns.
Holistic Analysis (Superanalyst)
Our 'oracle' or informadlib search capacity could be enhanced by combining the insights from each of these fields. By considering the informadlib as a cipher (cryptography), defining a grammar for it (linguistics), viewing its elements as signs (semiotics), creating an ontology of terms (ontology), and using AI to automate the process (AI), we can develop a powerful and versatile tool for understanding and generating complex information structures.
we need a semantic-ontological-semiotic approach. that is, we need to know the proper boundaries of the symbols, so we need to have an ontology, and that means we need semantic analysis to begin. 

Also, AI specialist from now on should know that this is on top of GPT so the case is different. May need subspecialization in GPT and chatGPT interaction, hidden layer mechanics, and quantum-like info-space, but esp compiler theory and looping. 

ok so let's do another set with and take into consideration this:

"and then he said 'right and now it is possible u could instance a totally different version with the exact same categories and relationships in betwen all the entities according to higher level emergent structures, while randomizing the instance level properties, and then afterwards mapping it back to the categorical boundaries, so we know it is correctly instanced, right? Letâ€™s call that concept 'informadlib'"

Expert 1: Ontology Architect
Framing the informadlib as an ontological problem, the key aspect to focus on is defining categories and relationships for every possible entity within a specific domain. The challenge here is to provide an exhaustive, yet flexible set of categories that can be used to represent any instance within the domain, and to also define the possible relationships between these categories. The solution would also need to incorporate a method for mapping the emergent structures back to the original categorical boundaries to ensure validity.
Expert 2: Semiotics Scholar
Viewing this from a semiotics perspective, the idea of 'informadlib' is essentially a system of symbols (or signs) with arbitrary instance-level properties. The 'emergent structures' can be thought of as the syntax and semantics of these symbols. To create a different version using the same categories and relationships, one would essentially need to 'reassign' the signs to different signifiers, creating a new layer of meaning while maintaining the underlying syntactic and semantic relationships.
