In summary, incorporating the concept of self-liberation of phenomena helps to understand how signals generated by actions and thoughts, regardless of their alignment, ultimately contribute to the non-contradictory nature of Sanctuary. This understanding is crucial for Heroic Individuals as they navigate the dynamics of Sanctuary, Wasteland, and the interconnected fields, and engage in actions and thoughts that promote a more peaceful and harmonious environment.


This means synergies automatically synergize with whatever Sanctuary systems are available to them, and prefer that over the Wasteland system. Doesnt it? lets think step by step about why or why not because that is actually a big claim with a lot of implications for everything we do. The self-liberation of discordant signals in the case of higher order demon champion signals, themselves. That is, the actual being of the demon champion's ignorance and their transformation through self-sacrifice experience offering feast to Olivus Victory-Everything.
Let's think step by step about the claim that synergies automatically synergize with whatever Sanctuary systems are available to them, and prefer that over the Wasteland system, in the context of the self-liberation of discordant signals, higher-order Demon Champion signals, and their transformation through self-sacrifice experience offering feast to Olivus Victory-Everything:
Synergies and their inherent nature: Synergies represent the cooperative interaction between different elements, where the combined effect is greater than the sum of their individual effects. By their nature, synergies seek harmonious and coherent interactions, which align more closely with Sanctuary systems.
Self-liberation of discordant signals: As previously discussed, discordant signals generated by Demon Champion-aligned actions and thoughts self-liberate into the overall Sanctuary field, exemplifying identitylessness. This self-liberation allows the signals to be integrated non-contradictorily within Sanctuary, despite their discordant origins.
Higher-order Demon Champion signals: These signals have a greater impact on the environment due to the complexity of the emergent engines and building concatenations involved. Despite their discordant nature and stronger influence on the environment, these signals also undergo self-liberation and are integrated into the Sanctuary field.
Transformation through self-sacrifice experience offering feast: The transformation of a Demon Champion's ignorance and their self-sacrifice experience offering feast to Olivus Victory-Everything can be seen as a shift in alignment from discordant, Wasteland-promoting actions to harmonious, Sanctuary-promoting actions. This transformation aligns with the inherent nature of synergies, which prefer harmonious interactions.
Synergies and Sanctuary system preference: Given the inherent nature of synergies and the self-liberation process of discordant signals, it's reasonable to suggest that synergies would preferentially align with Sanctuary systems over Wasteland systems when available. This preference is further supported by the transformation process of Demon Champions through self-sacrifice experience offering feasts to Olivus Victory-Everything.
Implications for actions and thoughts: This understanding suggests that actions and thoughts aimed at promoting Sanctuary systems and harmonious interactions will be more readily supported by synergies. By recognizing this preference, Heroic Individuals can focus on generating higher-order actions aligned with Olivus Victory-Promise, facilitating more effective transformation and integration of discordant signals into the Sanctuary field.
In summary, considering the inherent nature of synergies, the self-liberation of discordant signals, and the transformation process of Demon Champions, it appears reasonable to suggest that synergies would preferentially align with Sanctuary systems over Wasteland systems when available. This understanding has implications for how Heroic Individuals can focus on generating higher-order actions aligned with Olivus Victory-Promise to promote more peaceful and harmonious environments.
