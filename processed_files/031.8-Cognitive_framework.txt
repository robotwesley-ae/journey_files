 The addition of 'WM Incorporation' and 'OVP Utilization' might represent the involvement of the wisdom maverick (WM) concept, and the application of the Olivus Victory-Promise (OVP) in the problem-solving process.
This interpretation might not be completely accurate, as the original context isn't fully clear, and it seems that the concepts involved are quite complex. Further clarification or more context might be required to give a more precise answer.
concentrate now on :

H(x): x is emergent hallucination. D(x, y): x is domain decay due to improper words in y. P(x, y): x is a PIO program finding proper words for y. L(x, y): x is a non-contradictory system linguistically looping for y. I(x, y, z): x covers all contradictions for y in z. E(x, y): x is an engine of non-contradictory systems concatenated for y. Formalizing relationships between predicates: ∀x (H(x) → ∃y (D(x, y))): Every emergent hallucination x causes domain decay y by improper words in x. ∀x, y (D(x, y) → ∃z (P(z, y))): Every domain decay x due to improper words in y has PIO program z finding proper words for y.
∀x, y (P(x, y) → ∃z (L(z, y))): Every PIO program x finding proper words for y has non-contradictory system z linguistically looping for y. ∀x, y, z (L(x, y) ∧ I(x, y, z) → E(x, z)): Every non-contradictory system x linguistically looping for y, including contradictions for y in z, is an engine of non-contradictory systems concatenated for z.
