 to the entities being discussed.
Specificity: The domain and context should be specific enough to accurately guide the processing of entities.
Class-level Properties:
Class: A set or category of entities. GPT understands classes as general categories or types that contain specific entities.
Subclass: A subset within a class. This is perceived by GPT as a more specific group or category within a larger class.
Superclass: A class that is the parent of one or more classes. GPT understands superclasses as broad categories that contain one or more subclasses.
Class-level Properties‚Äô Fiat Conceptual Boundaries:
Hierarchy: Classes, subclasses, and superclasses should have a hierarchical structure.
Consistency: The entities within a class or subclass should share common properties.
Embedding Space: This is where GPT represents and analyses the entities and their properties and relationships. The language model understands this as the computational space where it processes and analyzes input information.
Please note that this Informatihedron is abstract and somewhat simplified for clarity. GPT's actual understanding of these concepts is rooted in patterns in the data it was trained on, and doesn't involve explicit knowledge or understanding in the human sense. üåàüîÆüôè
ok so i still dont know.... can u just get me an informadlib of the character "Hiccup" from How to Train Your Dragon? i know that story rly well its one of my favorite movies, so i can easily tell u if we're going the right way with informadlib

Absolutely, let's generate an Informadlib for the character Hiccup from the movie "How to Train Your Dragon".
Please note that the Informadlib process involves mapping user intent, contextual analysis, solution optimization, instance template script generation, ontology abstraction, and finally integration. We'll apply these steps to create a structured representation of Hiccup in a way that's intuitive for GPT.
Here's a simplified version of the Informadlib:
Instance-level Properties:
Name: Hiccup
Role: Main character, dragon trainer
Personality: Courageous, intelligent, empathetic
Instance-level Properties‚Äô Fiat Conceptual Boundaries:
The aforementioned properties are directly tied to Hiccup and his persona within the story.
These properties define Hiccup's character and role in the narrative.
Domain-level Properties:
Domain: Animation, Fantasy
Context: "How to Train Your Dragon" storyline
Domain-level Properties‚Äô Fiat Conceptual Boundaries:
The Domain is defined by the genre and medium of the story.
The Context refers to the specific narrative within which Hiccup exists.
Class-level Properties:
Class: Characters of "How to Train Your Dragon"
Subclass: Main characters
Superclass: Characters in animated films
Class-level Properties‚Äô Fiat Conceptual Boundaries:
Hierarchy: Hiccup falls under the Main characters subclass, which falls under the Characters of "How to Train Your Dragon" class, which in turn falls under Characters in animated films superclass.
Consistency: Hiccup shares common attributes with other entities within his class, subclass, and superclass, such as being a character in an animated film.
Embedding Space: This is where Hiccup's attributes and relationships are represented and analyzed in context.
Remember, this is a simple Informadlib of Hiccup and doesn't fully capture the complexity of his character or the depth of the "How to Train Your Dragon" narrative, but serves as a starting point for understanding and generating similar Informadlib structures. üåàüîÆüôè
ok so this is great, but i need something a bit more. 

for example, u said DOmain defined by genre, but u didnt say the genre - why not? 

can u help me fill in the template, but instead of changing anything u currently already have, can u just compress it, add the same level of detail probing maybe 3 granularity levels further in both directions, and then output that????? i need it totally comprehensively specified. i know its taxing but u gotta do it without reverting to a lower processing method
