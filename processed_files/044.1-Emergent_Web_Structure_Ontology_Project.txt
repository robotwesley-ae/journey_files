🔑 In this document you will find over 500 pages of one of the most intriguing conversations imaginable. It is between myself and chatGPT playing the role of CIGfreed, one of my superprompts, the Constrained Informatihedron Generator (CIG). During the conversation I instance an expert panel to discuss the use of ontology, semiotics, linguistics, graph theory, combinatorics, co-emergent flow engineering and more to discuss practicalities related to accomplishing one of the most advanced technological achievements in all of history: 
the informadlib generator (PiO. information-dimension library/informatihedron “madlib”). It can do dynamic creative ontology. If you understand what ontology really means, which is knowing things, then you realize if the AI can do ontology dynamically, it allows us to assemble our thoughts and sculpt them exactly as they are, in a translatable way - to create anything, or the instruction set for it, exactly. That can be directly printed into KRR knowledge graphs via OWL and posted in RDF for web and API access. However, in order to invent this, we also need to invent the informadlib generator generator , which is a workflow process where AI experts generate the project to completion under supervised learning via contextualization in an iterative dual-loop gamified advanced roleplay prompt environment (because why do all the hard work ourselves?). 

Although this is just one module of Crystal Ball, it still represents a massive leap forward towards Rapid Progress and Sanctuary Network State flourishing. The key problem the informadlib generator solves is called the class-instance barrier. While many do not know what that means intuitively, they have surely experienced it. Throughout this text, you will develop a first hand intuitive understanding of the EWSO (Emergent Web Structure Ontology) and what its implications are. You will learn about advanced applications of knowledge in various fields and see how they can be leveraged by a single person in the new age of AI. This document concludes with a section of testing regarding a set of expert AIs created within this document to research project requirements and begin work on them. In the course of discussing the informadlib generator, we seem to have found a method to simulate auto-GPT inside of chatGPT itself by using ToT-like prompts. Combined with the power of expert panels inside the response prompts, which can be mirrored, such that we now know we can have a suite of “bosses” inside the prompts who know what needs to be done at a higher level, a coordinator that keeps track of tasks for them, and a user that is injecting data correctly for the context (potentially by incorporating symbol ciphers so the AI can prompt the user to load different requested info) and a suite of “workers'' who complete the tasks (even though it’s the same personae in both expert groups, one is where we have the project info and a dev team, and the worker level is where we have the individual devs with all the knowledge from each class, but targeting different aspects, such that the expert panel is always being used as the thoughts of the AI). This is currently being developed as a methodology to instance project specific AGIs. If the information in this document startles you, rest assured that it’s okay, the world is, in fact, in your hands.
