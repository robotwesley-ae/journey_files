 about sneaking into the VIP section to meet a celebrity." I like this one

Great! Here's a possible rewrite:
As Chad finishes his emotional story, Jeremy's phone rings, interrupting their conversation. It's a call from his wife, who's furious and yelling on the other end of the line. Apparently, Zion butt-dialed her, and she heard everything -- including his son's voice saying something about sneaking into the VIP section to meet a celebrity.
Jeremy's heart skips a beat. This is the break he's been waiting for. He thanks his wife for the clue and hangs up, trying to act casual in front of Chad. But inside, he's a mess of nerves and excitement.
He turns to Chad, his high and drunk state making it difficult to focus. "We gotta get to the VIP section, man. Zion's there with a celebrity." Chad looks at him, confused and slightly alarmed. "What? Who? How do you know?"
Jeremy fumbles for an answer, making up a story about overhearing someone in the crowd talking about it. Chad doesn't seem convinced, but he's too high to argue. Together, they stumble towards the VIP section, Jeremy leading the way with a newfound sense of purpose.
As they approach the entrance, they're stopped by a burly security guard. Jeremy tries to talk their way past him, but the guard isn't having it. "Sorry, guys. No access without a pass."
Undeterred, Jeremy decides to take matters into his own hands. He charges at the guard, hoping to catch him off guard. But the guard is quick, and he grabs Jeremy by the arm, dragging him away from the entrance.
Chad starts laughing uncontrollably, drawing even more attention to them. Jeremy tries to break free, but the guard is too strong. They're both thrown out of the VIP area, humiliated and disappointed.
As they make their way back into the crowd, Jeremy starts to sober up. The reality of the situation hits him -- he's lost his son, and he has no idea where he is or what he's doing. The VIP section was a dead end, and he's back to square one.
Chad looks at him sympathetically, sensing Jeremy's frustration. "We'll find him, man. Don't worry." Jeremy nods, trying to keep his spirits up. But as the night wears on, he starts to lose hope. Maybe Zion doesn't want to be found. Maybe he's happy on his own, without his father around.
As the sun starts to rise, Jeremy and Chad sit on the grass, exhausted and defeated. They've searched every inch of the festival, talked to dozens of people, and come up empty-handed. Jeremy is ready to give up.
But just when he thinks all hope is lost, he spots a familiar figure in the distance -- Zion, walking towards them with a smile on his face. Jeremy jumps up, relief flooding his body. "Zion! Thank god, we've been looking for you all night!" Zion just shrugs, looking slightly annoyed. "I'm fine, Dad. I've been with my friends."

Great! Now rewrite the following: "As Chad finishes his emotional story, Jeremy's phone rings, interrupting their conversation. It's a call from his wife, who's furious and yelling on the other end of the line. Apparently, Zion butt-dialed her, and she heard everything -- including his son's voice saying something about sneaking into the VIP section to meet a celebrity. Jeremy's mind races as he tries to come up with a cover story. He tells his wife that Zion is right there with him. His wife is skeptical but buys the story, and Jeremy breathes a sigh of relief. He turns to Chad, who's still giggling uncontrollably, and tells him they need to get into the VIP section. "
