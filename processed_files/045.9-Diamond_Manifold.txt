By words or by actions
May any poison I have sent out to them
Not cause any damage 
And by the blessings of the Wisdom Mind of Clear Light
may I be kept from hurting anyone else 
May forgiveness increase wherever it lacks
And may this prayer make it all so  

Listen, Child of Identity-less Wisdom: 
The Middle Nature is your true identity
So attune to it, tame your windhorse with the Middle
And journey through the rainbow sky  
Confidently overcome the darkness of the view of hope and fear 
Awaken in the Realm of Akanishta
And behold the Identity-less Open Seat of Diamond Being
True Face of the Source
Illuminator
The Wish-Fulfilling Tree

In the name of the nature and all its emanations:

On my right shoulder the Nirmanakaya
And on my left shoulder the Sambhogakaya 
And wherever I look the magical Vajradhatu
And whatever happens the Spontaneously Present Great Perfection

And my continuum
And my continuum 
My own windhorse 

Don’t break your sacred word and bonds; always repair transgressions of vows. 

As you fall asleep, imagine your windhorse heartmind ascending and expanding into the infinite space of the Vajradhatu.

May forgiveness increase wherever it lacks
And may this prayer make it all so

Advice on manifesting angels: 
“Seek not out the things that are too hard for thee, neither search the things that are above thy strength. But what is commanded thee, think thereupon with reverence; for it is not needful for thee to see with thine eyes the things that are in secret." 
Sirach (iii. 21–22)

Explanation of Superlogical Wisdom
