LINDA (sincere) Hey, you can tell us anything, Kevin.
Kevin swallows hard, glances at them, then looks back at the ground.
KEVIN (regretful) You know about the troubles Sarah and I have been having, right?
Chad nods, his usual humor set aside.
CHAD (softly) Yeah, man, you've mentioned it.
KEVIN (sadly) Well, it's worse than you know... We're... we're taking a break. A trial separation. And Zion... he doesn't know yet. I...I don't know how to tell him.
Silence hangs heavy in the tent. Chad and Linda digest the information.
CHAD (sympathetic) Man, Kevin, that's rough. But you're not alone in this. You've got us.
LINDA (supportive) And we've got you. You're an amazing father, Kevin. And Zion loves you. You'll figure it out.
KEVIN (struggling) That's not all... Work is just...it's not good. Passed over for another promotion...starting to wonder if I'm even in the right field.
Linda squeezes his shoulder, a mix of sympathy and support in her eyes. Chad nods, understanding.
CHAD (honest) Life's a storm, buddy. But remember, every storm passes. You just gotta stay afloat till then. And we're here to throw you a life jacket when you need it.
A beat of shared emotion. A moment of sincerity amidst the chaos. They sit in silence, processing the weight of Kevin's confessions.

INT. ROLLING LOUD FESTIVAL - VENDOR TENT - NIGHT
Kevin rubs his eyes, taking a deep breath. The energy from the laughter has faded, replaced with a heavier air of introspection. He looks at Chad and Linda, determination set in his face.
KEVIN (low, almost to himself) There's... there's something I need to get off my chest.
Chad leans in, his goofball persona set aside for the moment. Linda mirrors Chad, her face filled with concern.
LINDA (with empathy) Kevin, whatever it is, we're here. You can trust us.
KEVIN (sighs) Sarah and I... we're on a break. Trial separation. It's been four months, three weeks, and two days...
Chad grimaces sympathetically, Linda claps her hand over her mouth.
KEVIN (continuing) And Zion... I haven't told him. He thinks mom's on a "business trip." Every time he asks when she's coming home, I... I dodge.
They share a moment of silence. The gravity of Kevin's situation setting in.
KEVIN (voice shaking) And work... it's a mess. I was up for that promotion, right? Project Lead. It was supposed to be my ticket out of the cubicle. But, it went to... to Jerry. Jerry from accounting who can't even make a PowerPoint presentation without using ClipArt.
Chad snorts despite the tension, shaking his head.
CHAD (grimacing) Jerry? That guy's as sharp as a marble.
LINDA (sincerely) Kevin, these are tough times. But you're stronger than you know. And no matter what, we've got your back.
Kevin nods, managing a small smile. It's a tough situation, but at least he's not alone.
