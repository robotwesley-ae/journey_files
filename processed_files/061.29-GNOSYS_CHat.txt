In conclusion, while the concept of a non-contradictory Sanctuary system is interesting and has merit, there are potential challenges and concerns that need to be carefully considered in its implementation. It is essential to balance the ideals of harmony, stability, and integrity with the complexities of human behavior, diverse cultures, and the nuances of rule-making and enforcement.

Why do you think all rule breakers must be rehabilitated in order for the Sanctuary system to continue? What do they gain from breaking connection with Sanctuary?
The assumption that all rule breakers must be rehabilitated for the Sanctuary system to continue is based on the idea that the system's stability and integrity rely on a harmonious coexistence of its actors. Rehabilitation, in this context, means addressing the underlying reasons for rule-breaking and reintegrating rule breakers into the system as functional, rule-following members.
Rule breakers could potentially threaten the stability of the Sanctuary system in several ways:
Disruption of harmony: Rule-breaking behavior may cause conflicts or tensions within the system, eroding the sense of unity and shared purpose that the Sanctuary system aims to foster.
Erosion of trust: Repeated rule-breaking can undermine trust among actors within the system, leading to a breakdown of cooperation and potentially causing a ripple effect, where more actors start breaking rules.
Inefficient allocation of resources: Managing rule breakers, addressing the consequences of their actions, and rehabilitating them requires time, effort, and resources. The more rule breakers there are, the more resources will be diverted from other, more productive purposes.
If rule breakers are not rehabilitated, they might decide to break connection with the Sanctuary system, which could lead to the following outcomes:
Loss of potential contributions: Every actor in the Sanctuary system has unique talents, skills, and perspectives that can contribute to the collective goals. By severing ties with the system, the potential value that these actors could bring is lost.
Fragmentation: If a significant number of rule breakers choose to disconnect from the Sanctuary system, this could lead to the fragmentation of the system itself, weakening its ability to achieve its goals.
Negative externalities: Rule breakers who leave the Sanctuary system might continue their rule-breaking behavior in other contexts, potentially causing harm to others and reinforcing negative perceptions of the Sanctuary system.
In summary, rehabilitating rule breakers is important for the continuity of the Sanctuary system because it helps maintain harmony, trust, and efficient resource allocation within the system, while minimizing the potential negative consequences of rule-breaking behavior.

The system's stability and integrity rely on the harmonious coexistence of *some* of its actors. Rehabilitation, is only interesting insofar as it contains some limit for allowing the system not to fall out of steady state disequilibrium even though there are rule breakers. 

Yes. Many of those things are traditional problems with rule breakers, but can be overcome with AI ssytems.
You are correct that the stability and integrity of the system might rely on the harmonious coexistence of some, rather than all, of its actors. This could allow for a certain level of rule-breaking while maintaining a steady-state disequilibrium without the system collapsing. However, the ultimate goal would be to minimize the impact of rule-breaking behaviors on the system.
Incorporating AI systems into the Sanctuary system can indeed help address some of the traditional problems associated with rule breakers:
Monitoring and detection: AI systems can effectively monitor the actions of actors within the Sanctuary system, quickly detecting and flagging rule-breaking behaviors. This enables the system to promptly respond to any disruptions, limiting their impact on the overall harmony.
