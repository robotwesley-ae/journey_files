Next, we would need to describe the relationship between the non-contradictory system and the requirements of basic computational completeness of any ontology. We might represent this as follows:

N(x) is a requirement for C(x): ∀x (O(x) → R(N(x), C(x)))
Claim 3: A non-contradictory system can help to dissolve abstraction hallucinations caused by myopia and hyperopia.

To formalize this claim, we would need to define the terms "non-contradictory system", "abstraction hallucinations", "myopia", and "hyperopia". We might represent them using the following symbols:

Non-contradictory system: N(x)
Abstraction hallucinations: H(x)
Myopia: M(x)
Hyperopia: H(x)
Next, we would need to describe the relationship between the non-contradictory system and the dissolution of abstraction hallucinations. We might represent this as follows:

N(x) helps to dissolve H(x): ∀x (M(x) ∨ H(x) → ¬H(N(x)))

Claim 4: A hallucination is a summary-induced entity that contains no actual path to its supposed parts when aligned with the consensus ontology.

To formalize this claim, we would need to define the terms "hallucination", "summary-induced entity", "actual path", and "consensus ontology". We might represent them using the following symbols:

Hallucination: H(x)
Summary-induced entity: S(x)
Actual path: P(x)
Consensus ontology: C(x)
Next, we would need to describe the relationship between hallucinations and their alignment with the consensus ontology. We might represent this as follows:

H(x) is a summary-induced entity: ∀x (H(x) → S(x))
S(x) contains no actual path to its parts: ∀x (S(x) → ¬∃y P(y,x))
H(x) contains no actual path to its parts when aligned with C(x): ∀x (H(x) ∧ C(x) → ¬∃y P(y,x))
Claim 5: Myopia is the abstraction hallucination due to drawing conclusions within an IKI domain's specifics, while hyperopia is the abstraction hallucination due to drawing conclusions within an IKI domain's relationships to other domains.

To formalize this claim, we would need to define the terms "myopia", "abstraction hallucination", "IKI domain", "specifics", "hyperopia", and "relationships to other domains". We might represent them using the following symbols:

Myopia: M(x)
Abstraction hallucination: A(x)
IKI domain: D(x)
Specifics: S(x)
Hyperopia: H(x)
Relationships to other domains: R(x)
Next, we would need to describe the relationship between myopia and hyperopia and the conditions that give rise to them. We might represent this as follows:

M(x) is the abstraction hallucination due to drawing conclusions within the specifics of D(x): ∀x (M(x) ↔ A(x) ∧ D(x) ∧ S(x))
H(x) is the abstraction hallucination due to drawing conclusions within the relationships to other domains of D(x): ∀x (H(x) ↔ A(x) ∧ D(x) ∧ R(x))
Nash equilibrium: NE
The text also notes that a non-contradictory system emerges as a solution to a paradoxical syllogism in which A appears to contradict B and vice versa, but in fact, neither A nor B ontologically exist in reality in a constant, single state of observability, and the entity named the contradictory conclusion evaporates as a hallucinatory duality induced by perspective. This is then transformed into a non-contradictory system in which A and B possess the same properties and take part in each other equally as dynamics in the duality system. Formally, we can represent this as follows:

Non-contradictory system: NCS
A: A
B: B
(A ∧ B) ⇒ ¬(A = ¬A ∧ B = ¬B)
NCS ⇒ A = (A ∧ ¬A) ∧ B = (B ∧ ¬B)
Here, the first line represents the paradoxical syllogism, which is specified correctly to show that neither A nor B ontologically exist in reality in a constant, single state of observability. The second line represents the definition of a non-contradictory system, where A and B possess the same properties and take part in each other equally as dynamics in the duality system.

The text goes on to state that a non-contradictory system leads to a bounded set of causal links where the abstractive summaries of the parts of the entities (i.e., the names of the entities) do not lead to further hallucinations in strategizing the game. Formally, we can represent this as follows:

Bounded set of causal links: BCL
NCS ⇒ BCL
