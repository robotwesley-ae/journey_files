 they're constantly knocked down by crowd surfers. The entire mosh pit turns on them, and they become the targets of everyone's aggression. They fight back, knocking people left and right. Chad even gets a few body slams in, Kevin accidentally elbows a drunk teenage girl in the face, sending her down, and Linda tries to shield herself from the chaos. The crowd turns on them, angry at the two middle-aged men and Linda for hurting one of their own. Suddenly, Kevin's pants get ripped off, leaving him in his underwear. Chad can't stop laughing at the sight of his old high school buddy being pantsed in the middle of a mosh pit. To make matters worse, Chad and Kevin's clothes get ripped off, leaving them nearly naked in the middle of the mosh pit, while Linda struggles to avoid the same fate. People almost rip Linda’s clothes off, but then realize she’s weird and don’t. She almost takes offense and wants people to rip her clothes off too, she makes it weird and it gets quiet. People start spraying them with silly string and throwing empty beer cans at them. Kevin, Chad, and Linda try to cover themselves, but it's too late. They've become a target for the angry mob. Just when they think things can't get any worse, they get lifted into the air by the crowd and start to crowd surf. The middle-aged men and Linda scream in terror as they're passed around like beach balls. Eventually, they get dumped back onto the ground, pantless and disoriented. Chad is doubled over in laughter, while Kevin just looks defeated and Linda tries to maintain some sense of dignity. They still haven't found Zion, and now they're all half-naked in the middle of a sea of people. As they struggle to get out of the mosh pit, Linda leads the way, using her volunteer badge to gain access to restricted areas and bypass some of the chaos. They accidentally knock over a small vendor's cart, spilling drinks and snacks all over the place. The vendor starts shouting and cursing at them, adding to the chaos. They continue on, determined to find Zion based on the clue from his Snapchat photo.

FADE IN:
EXT. MOSH PIT - NIGHT
The mosh pit is a living beast of bodies, crashing together. KEVIN, CHAD, and LINDA struggle to stay upright. Bodies surf above them, people all around pushing and shoving.
KEVIN This was a horrible idea!
Suddenly, a rowdy CROWD-SURFER rips off Kevin's pants. Chad laughs, but the joke's on him when his clothes are torn off next. Linda nearly falls victim too, but the crowd pulls back at the last second, leaving her intact but offended.
LINDA What, I'm not good enough to get pantsed?!
The crowd awkwardly avoids her gaze. Silence blankets the pit. It's broken only by the 'HISS' and 'SPLAT' of cans of SILLY STRING being sprayed at them. Empty beer cans soon follow. The trio are suddenly lifted off their feet, screaming, as they're unwillingly crowd-surfed around the pit.
LATER -
The trio are dumped unceremoniously back on the ground, pantless and disoriented. Chad is laughing, Kevin looks defeated, and Linda tries to hold onto her dignity.
KEVIN I feel like we're missing the point here.
LINDA Shut up, Kevin.
They push through the chaos, Linda leading the way using her volunteer badge. They knock over a VENDOR'S CART, causing a shower of drinks and snacks to rain down. The vendor shouts curses after them.
VENDOR You better pay for this!
Linda turns back, indignant.
LINDA We're on a mission!
As the chaos ensues, Kevin pulls out his phone, holding up the Snapchat photo.
KEVIN We're close. We have to find Zion.
They disappear into the crowd, leaving the upturned cart and bewildered vendor behind.
FADE OUT.
