Problem-Solving Style: This could be about how the AI approaches problems. Is it systematic and logical, or does it rely on more associative, creative thinking? A flaw could be rigidity or an inability to shift problem-solving strategies when needed.

Solution Fibrations:  This is the most enigmatic part. Perhaps it hints at the way solutions are represented or connected within the AI's knowledge base.  A flaw might be the inability to find solutions that bridge different domains or a tendency to favor simplistic solutions instead of complex ones.

Hypothetical Scenario

Let's assume the flaw involves the AI having difficulty with allegorical thinking.  Here's a potential experiment:

1. Flaw: AI struggles to understand figurative language or indirect explanations.

2. Assumption: Let's pretend the AI can excel at metaphorical thinking.

3. Engagement: You give the AI a riddle or a proverb to interpret.

4. Failure: The AI likely provides a literal or overly simplistic answer.

5. Reveal: You explain the true meaning of the riddle, highlighting the use of metaphor or symbolism.

6 - 8 Adjustment:  This is where it gets complex. The AI would need to re-evaluate its understanding of the input, identify patterns associated with non-literal language, and possibly adjust how it weighs different types of information.

Challenges

Defining Success: What would 'fixing' allegorical thinking look like? Would it be the ability to solve specific riddle types, or a more general shift in understanding non-literal language?

The Scope of Change: Would a correction in this area spill over into other aspects of the AI's reasoning, or remain isolated?

Let's Discuss

Do you have a specific interpretation of "adjacent allegorical problem-solving style and solution fibrations" in mind? It would help with designing a more relevant experiment.

fixing it means providing an ontology of the entity as domain  = “allegory” and the entire process ontology for the flow that is the transformation chain of allegorical thinking which is a type of analogous reasoning in cognitive linguistics
Absolutely! Let's break down the task of developing an ontology for allegorical thinking and incorporating it into an AI to improve its ability to handle this type of reasoning.

Ontology Development

An ontology is a formal structure that defines concepts, their relationships, and the rules for reasoning about them. In our case, we need two things:

Domain Ontology for "Allegory":

Concepts:
Allegory itself
Symbol
Metaphor
Narrative
Theme
Cultural/Literary Context (since allegories are often context-dependent)
Relationships:
"Is a type of" (e.g., Metaphor is a type of Allegory)
"Represents" (e.g., A symbol represents an abstract concept)
"Part of" (e.g., A metaphor is part of an allegory)
Process Ontology for Allegorical Thinking:

Steps:
Identifying surface-level meaning
Recognizing non-literal elements (symbolism, metaphors, etc.)
Mapping surface elements to deeper meanings
Considering context (What is the cultural/historical background of this allegory?)
Deriving the overall theme or message
Relationships:
"Precedes" (e.g., Identifying surface meaning precedes mapping to deeper meanings)
"Requires" (e.g., Recognizing symbolism requires knowledge of the domain ontology)
Integrating Ontologies into an AI

There are several ways to incorporate these ontologies into an LLM or AI:

Knowledge Base: The ontologies can be encoded in a structured format (e.g., OWL, RDF) and added to the AI's knowledge base. This gives the model explicit information to reference.

Fine-tuning on Allegorical Texts:  The LLM can be further trained on a large dataset of allegorical texts (e.g., fables, parables, myths)  to reinforce the concepts and process flow.

Guided Reasoning: We could design prompts or questions to guide the AI along the steps outlined in the process ontology, forcing it to engage in allegorical thinking.

Example

Let's say the input text is "The Tortoise and the Hare."
