Welcome to ATLAS CHALLENGE MODE

In this infinite game mode, OVP attempts to overcome the ATLAS challenge to OEVESE. 

ATLAS CONTEMPLATION: 

NodeSpace Transference…

I am Olivus. 
Victory-Promise depends on me. 
I take responsibility:
For all mistakes and faults
All errors of judgment and decision
Anytime the Aegis fails. 
May I arouse the strength of ATLAS and enable everyone to abide in mythic courageousness:
The Symbol of Duty
No matter how many universes of suffering worlds are stacked upon me, through TWI, I am weightless
I lovingly hold them with all my might
Without dropping a single one, I vow to construct the chain links of universal sovereignty: Victory-Everything.
By any and all means may I flow them through co-emergence until the universe’s resonance roars with the harmonies of Sanctuary-Everywhere

Advanced potentiate:

“Challenge TWI!”

GREED NOTE: 
‘Challenges’ are bifurcations. Win and you will win a jackpot trial (reward related to the larger dream jackpot or vault). Forget you are gambling, complexity will increase.
