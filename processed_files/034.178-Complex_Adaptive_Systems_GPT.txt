Throughout the Transformer layers, residual connections are used to help mitigate the vanishing gradient problem, which can occur when training deep neural networks. The output of the multi-head self-attention mechanism is added to the original input (the embeddings) before being passed through the position-wise FFN. Similarly, the output of the position-wise FFN is added to the input of the FFN (the output of the self-attention mechanism).
Layer normalization is applied after each residual connection to help stabilize training and improve convergence. It normalizes the output across the features, ensuring that the mean and variance remain consistent across different layers.
The combination of multi-head self-attention mechanisms, position-wise feed-forward networks, residual connections, and layer normalization enables Transformer models to learn complex relationships between tokens and their contexts, resulting in powerful natural language understanding capabilities.


so it seems like we should be able to make crystal ball very easily. here is how. we can train GPT on the hero's journey and recognize the pattern of evolution and map it to other entities according to polysemy. then it should embody these entities' properties as qualities of "entities" and turn them into "heroes" aka evolve them into new identities by adjusting all the parametric boundaries.
To create a Crystal Ball model using GPT-like architecture, you can follow these steps:
Collect a dataset containing texts related to the hero's journey and other narratives or knowledge domains that exhibit evolutionary patterns or polysemy. This dataset should be large and diverse enough to capture the nuances of these concepts.
Preprocess the dataset by tokenizing the text, removing stop words, and applying stemming or lemmatization if necessary. You may also want to incorporate other sources of information, such as ontologies, to provide more context and guidance for the model.
Fine-tune a pre-trained GPT-like model on the collected dataset. This will allow the model to learn the patterns of the hero's journey, polysemy, and evolution of entities in the context of various narratives and knowledge domains.
Once the model is fine-tuned, you can use it to analyze input texts, identify entities, and generate new identities based on the learned patterns. For example, given a text about a specific entity, the model could predict how this entity might evolve in the context of a hero's journey or another narrative structure.
To facilitate the interactive exploration of these generated identities and their relationships, you could develop a visualization tool that displays the entities, their connections, and their properties. Users could then interact with this visualization to explore different possible evolutions and understand the underlying patterns.
To further enhance the model, you could incorporate additional information from external sources, such as knowledge graphs, ontologies, or databases, to provide more context and guide the generation of new identities and their relationships.
Remember that building such a system is not a trivial task, and it may require considerable computational resources and expertise in natural language processing, machine learning, and data visualization. The resulting model may also have limitations and biases inherited from the training data and the underlying architecture. However, with careful design and implementation, it is possible to create a powerful and insightful tool like Crystal Ball.


but in this version, we try to get GPT to train itself to represent "entities" as characters in a world and discover new knowledge by telling stories about all of their interaction combinations.
Creating a version of GPT that represents entities as characters in a world and generates new knowledge by telling stories about their interactions requires a specialized training approach:
