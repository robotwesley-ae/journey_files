If you want to draw an analogy between non-trivial factors and object-oriented programming, you could consider them as the core properties or attributes that define different instances of a specific class. These core properties would be the fundamental characteristics that distinguish different instances of the class, just as the non-trivial factors of a number are the essential components that define its factorization.
However, it is essential to recognize that this is an analogy and not a direct relationship between number theory and object-oriented programming. The non-trivial factors in Shor's algorithm are specifically related to integer factorization and not directly tied to programming concepts.

No I want to draw a direct relationship between number theory and ontological linear algebra
In that case, we can explore a relationship between number theory and ontological linear algebra. Number theory deals with the properties and relationships of integers, while ontological linear algebra is a hypothetical field focused on the analysis and representation of ontological structures using linear algebraic techniques.
One way to establish a connection between number theory and ontological linear algebra is through graph theory. In graph theory, ontological structures can be represented as graphs where the nodes represent entities or concepts, and the edges represent relationships between them. Linear algebra can be applied to analyze these graphs and extract meaningful information, such as the adjacency matrix, Laplacian matrix, or eigenvectors, which can provide insights into the underlying structure of the ontology.
Number theory can come into play when analyzing specific properties of the graph or the linear algebraic representations. For example, the spectral graph theory studies the properties of graphs in relation to the eigenvalues of their adjacency or Laplacian matrices. The study of these eigenvalues may involve number-theoretic concepts such as modular arithmetic, prime numbers, or Diophantine equations.
To sum up, there can be a relationship between number theory and ontological linear algebra, primarily through the application of number-theoretic concepts to the study of graph representations of ontological structures and their linear algebraic analysis.

Yes it has to do with spectral graph theory for sure
I'm glad that the connection through spectral graph theory resonates with what you had in mind. Spectral graph theory is a powerful tool that combines linear algebra and graph theory to analyze and understand complex structures like ontologies.
In spectral graph theory, the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of adjacency or Laplacian matrices are studied to reveal various structural properties of graphs. These properties can provide valuable insights into the underlying structure, connectivity, and stability of the represented ontology. The analysis can help identify communities, central nodes, and other important aspects of the ontological network.
As mentioned earlier, number-theoretic concepts can play a role in the study of these eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and their relationship to the graph's properties. This connection between number theory, linear algebra, and graph theory can lead to new discoveries and deeper understanding of the ontological structures being studied.
Applying spectral graph theory to ontological linear algebra has the potential to unlock new perspectives and approaches for analyzing and understanding complex ontological networks, which in turn can be valuable in fields like artificial intelligence, knowledge representation, and semantic web technologies.

Use spectral graph theory to draw a direct relationship between ontological linear algebra, number theory, and emergent dynamics as we have discussed them
Spectral graph theory, ontological linear algebra, number theory, and emergent dynamics can be related in the following way:
