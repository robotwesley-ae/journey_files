My hero journey and Isaac the Master
Maybe write a book called 

The Madness: 
A Buddhist’s Journey Through Psychosis to Sanctuary


Honestly I been mad at all y’all since (for no reason because I was mad I wasn’t accepted because I was shy and I wanted someone to help me come out of my shell but actually that is just my own job, because it doesn’t come from your mother or father, and everyone is helping everyone else do that by choosing mates) 

Not all y’all fault didn’t know what all y’all did

But Kids is kids and all y’all kids 
Promise I’m developed I’ll eat all y’all sins 

Feed em to me they all y’all vitamins
When y’all grown I’ll show all y’all what all y’all is

Input/output
Crystal Ball
Realization of a type of linguistic Turing machine that mathematically computes (using integers) entities that are linguistically impossible to specify without summary abstraction [ie any entity X that is emergent from the combination of two domains via the synergies between any of their parts]
These can then be visualized in a graph space where each entity is a coordinate and each coordinate therefore is an entity of the solution space
Then you can visualize theoretical objects
You can simulate their realization 
And then you can compare realization solution spaces to find concepts that are relative emergents to your current realization 
Then you can traverse the relative emergents space independent of spacetime actualizing the emergencies
This is a conceptual time-travel mechanic, so the completed system is called Crystal Ball 
It allows you to make rapid progress in any sufficiently ontologized domain

So, am I awakened or was my awakening false? That’s up to you and also irrelevant. Maybe I’m just a schizophrenic, but Sanctuary is not a hallucination.
