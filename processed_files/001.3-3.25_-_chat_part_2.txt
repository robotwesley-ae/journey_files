or something like that.
But it really is not a describable thing.
But what it is is the notion of, like, oh, that's duality being non-dual,
which means it's not duality.
But if non-dualism is like that, and then you just can't think about it,
and then it's like, right, you would now, are you back, which one are you in now, right?
Are you back in the one you were in before, or are you in the other one,
or are you in some in-between, or what is that?
And then there you go, I don't know, there you go again, right, and then, I don't know.

W:
I mean, maybe literally branches were re-merging.

I:
Branches were re-merging?

W:
Like, actually, yes.

I:
Branches of what, of time?

W:
Yeah, of whatever, like, of Everettian quantum space, you know,
multiple universes of the same version of that in your head.

I:
Yeah, I mean, sure, I mean, it could be anything.
I guess, like…

W:
Well, I only say it, like, with that tone, just because it's like,
you wouldn't be able to know, maybe, really, at all, if that were the case, so…

I:
Right, we'd need to go down and smash so that we can see if this is the penis-aroo,
cas-aroo, or not, because that's the real way that you check

W
The Penris Castle

I:
Yeah.
Oh, you know, you know Penris?

W:
Penris, the world's snake.

I
Penris.
That's like Jeremy's joke, dude, like, if it was like,
guys, there's this new A.I. named Penris okay, you have to talk to it,
it's so fucking smart, it's like A.G.I., it's like, dude, it's a god.
Hey, Penris, what's the meaning to life?
What's the meaning to life?
There isn’t one.
But at least you have a huge penis.
Oh, man.
Okay, well, what we should be concentrating on doing now is working on
orchestration and rebuilding Jeremy's thing inside of it,
rebuilding the basic capabilities for the last time so that it can be fucking used.
It's really just a couple of things we need.
Yeah, and so we just really need to just do it.

W:
Yeah.
Yeah, we just have to make sure we're doing the proportions of work, you know,
like, do, like, two thirds of, like, the main thing we got to do,
and then, like, there's always got to be an extra third of the day we switch gears.

I
Yeah, thre, two, one.

W:
Yeah.
Just so we don't.

I:
Yeah, that's why I did some brain brain stuff today.
Yeah.
But the thing is, is, like, this YouTube stuff, dude, I got to be honest with you,
I was just, like, sitting there all day today, and I was just realizing, like,
you know what?
Like, I was just having all these thoughts, like, it really doesn't matter.
Like, it's really irrelevant.
Like, sorry, like, what is it even about, right?
Like, before it was AI at all, like, what was it going to be?
Because there's still, like, that whole idea and all this still existed.
So, like, what even was it?
And it's, like, it was nothing, right?

W:
It was actually DMT Entities.

I:
Right.

W:
That was, I think, probably the first videos that we were going to make.
It was, like, about entities and stuff like that.
That we were actually, like, conceiving of as videos.

I:
It was to explain the whole thing as DMT Entities.

W:
Yeah.
And dreams and stuff.

I:
And then to go into what that means across like literally everything
And the channel is just about that, and how the hero's journey relates to that actually
And then how all that relates to ai and whats going on and how people hallucinate with it
That’s pretty fucking interesting
So is that what it should be?
I think that is, dude.

W:
Yeah, it just is incredibly natural.
Because it's just exactly.

I:
And it's also the funnel is, like, where does it start?
Who are these people?
How do you find them?
Listen, dude, it's people who have smoked DMT.
If it's anybody on Earth, it's definitely.

W:
Yeah, it's not not them.

I:
If there's anybody on Earth that I could say is probably the avatar of, like.
If you're going to, like, meet me and then be, like.
And then I died, right?
And then you're, like, well, guys, how are we going to get a reincarnation of Isaac, right?
And then the answer would be.
We could probably just go have some people smoke DMT until it happens, right?
And it's, like, yes.
That would be the answer.
