They should be compassionate and skilled in creating a supportive environment for individuals to explore their inner selves and make progress.
Effective Communication: Both roles require strong communication skills to convey complex concepts and practices clearly and persuasively. A tantric guru should be skilled in teaching and explaining tantric practices, while a Sanctuary coach must be able to articulate Sanctuary principles and techniques effectively.
