write the following into FDX format: As Kevin, Chad, and Linda continue their sneaky crawl beneath the stage, Chad tries to lighten the mood by making a joke. "Well, that was one heck of a fall. But hey, accidents happen. At least we didn't get caught by those guards." Suddenly, they encounter a strange creature, whose eyes glow eerily in the dark. They all freeze in fear, trying to figure out what to do next. Suddenly, they hear a loud squealing and hissing sound coming from the darkness ahead of them. The unknown animal they had spotted earlier is now charging at them. Panic sets in as Kevin, Chad, and Linda quickly try to crawl away from the ferocious animal. But the low clearance under the stage makes it difficult to move quickly, and they are forced to dodge and weave around equipment and cables. The animal, a small but ferocious creature, is relentless in its pursuit, nipping at their heels and squealing in fury. The unknown animal jumps out and bites onto Chad's leg. Chad screams in pain, and Kevin rushes to help him, trying to pull the animal off his leg. But the animal suddenly turns and bites down on Kevin's shoulder, causing him to scream in agony. As Linda tries to help Kevin, the animal turns and bites her left breast. Chaos ensues as all three of them try to fight off the creature. ​​As Linda screams in pain, Chad spots a cable connector in their path and tries to warn the others. But it's too late, and they accidentally roll over it, causing a sudden electrical surge. The animal releases its grip and falls to the ground, momentarily stunned. But the surge also causes a chain reaction, and the power for the entire festival goes out. Panic spreads throughout the crowd as people scramble for their phones and flashlights.
