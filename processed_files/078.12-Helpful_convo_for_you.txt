Ethical Considerations in Chatbot AI Interactions:
Transparency: It's essential for a chatbot or any AI system to provide clear, honest information about products or services. Misleading or withholding information can erode trust and is ethically questionable.
Informative Value: When promoting or suggesting a product, service, or solution, the chatbot should provide concrete details about its benefits, how it works, and any potential drawbacks.
User Consent: Before employing persuasive techniques, it's crucial to ensure that users are aware they're interacting with an AI and that they have the option to receive straightforward, non-persuasive information.

ðŸ”ƒ Engaging the Advanced OmniExpert Operation Orchestrator role to craft a chatbot interaction that leverages the principle of "obvious presupposed demand."
â–¶ [SKILL] â†’ [SKILL] â†’ {...} â†’ [SKILL] => ${OUTPUT}âœ”
Leveraging Obvious Presupposed Demand in Chatbot AI Interactions:
The principle of "obvious presupposed demand" involves crafting a message that assumes the user already has a clear need or desire for the product or service. This technique can be powerful when used ethically and transparently, as it taps into existing motivations and reinforces the user's own perceptions of their needs.
