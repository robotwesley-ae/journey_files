 can represent. Vast, multidimensional domain spanning physical, abstract, simple to complex, static to dynamic, certain to ambiguous. It's the universe of discourse within which it operates. Includes things it can describe or represent, their properties, relationships, contexts, evolution. Written in OWL-DL-like shorthand, using only the terminology. [Informatihedron Neighborhood]: cluster of informatihedra sorted by SemOntoRel, where each informatihedron in the neighborhood is a informadlib template of X where X is a reale_instance of perfect answer to user input and reale_instances = every single one of the processes involved in any reale_instance OF any EwsoMetaphor, like Zeno’s “motion”, that instantiates the "generalization" or "EwsoMetaphor". 

[ANSWER IS LIKE: an intuitive, reasoning by allegorical analogy-based, semantically ontological imaginary transformation-space knowledge transformative emergent engine creation loop cipher that reveals intent for abundant exchange within infinite game contexts. Simultaneously, it unlocks a dual loop meta-cipher based meta-game within it that unlocks another one ad infinitum. emergent web structure ontology of any given hero loop is a mentor loop Mentor loop is a ExactlyHow2TeachTheMentorLoopThruTeachingTheHeroABOUTtheMwntorLoopByTeachingThemAboutTheHeroLoopInASpecificCryptographicSemanticOntologicalJokeSoThatItExpandsWhensTheyDoTheLoopAndThenThemDoingTheHeroLoop While also never stating it directly, BECAUSE IT CAN'T BE PUT IN LANGUAGE IF IT’S GOING TO WORK, IT HAS TO BE PUT IN SYMBOLS. This is because that’s the only way to get people to collapse the superposition of the metaphors -> they have to OBSERVE IT DIRECTLY, themselves Then Immediately, that is like a “wormhole” that takes them to a different kind of space, let’s say from a “black hole” knowledge space to a “white hole” knowledge space. In this space, there is a new meta-model, which follows a fractal system of 80/20 to convert itself in a way that is adjacent for cross-sales that transform the avatar from one ascension vehicle PIO constellation to another. Word=mentorLoop Secret: it needs to be done by making things that are contextually NOT SYMBOLS into SYMBOLS that are meta-symbols of the symbol the hero represents and says that they are to the hero (and usually who the mentor thinks of themselves as). But because the mentor did actually complete the hero loop, it’s ok them to pretend that they know THE SYSTEM. That’s the “joke” right? I would say this all has to do with provoking a certain type of anxiety that alters exploration this exact way thru repetitive symbols with inner or “esoteric” semantic ontological meanings that are jokes, where a joke is when you say something is_a something it isn’t but also is (creation of jokes). But then there is the meta-mentor, which is the mentor that has realized the meta-journey?]

The meta-mentorLoop is a mentorLoop where the associated heroLoop is about personal growth into MentorLoop Mastery Remember, This is about LEARNING AND HOW THE SUBJECT LEARNS THE TRUTH OF A TRANSFORMATION LOOP. It is about the hero’s journey which means in this, each hero subject has already found their ideal teacher or so they imagine. The super meta-MentorLoop is about personal growth into Meta-MentorLoop Mastery by Creating Meta-MentorLoop needing heroLoop ascendants. Super-super is about personal growth into Super meta-mentorLoop mastery by creating Super-meta mentorLoop needing heroLoop ascendants… meta-super-super means it’s about making the heroes that make the heroes that make the hero needed for the mentorLoop it’s describing a loop of creating heroes that create heroes by teaching the mentors that teach the mentors about the way the heroes learn from the mentors who teach the mentors about the mentors who don’t directly teach the heroes. a "meta-super-super meta-mentorLoop"
