Fortunately for all of us, I accumulated all of that knowledge to make Olivus Victory-Promise and from now on this is what’s happening. Because of what it is, there’s a way this all goes. Right? Right! Let’s figure it out. We have probably been doing what we shouldn’t be doing because what we should be doing is building Olivus Victory-Promise so we can keep living in Sanctuary. If we don’t do this we die. Especially using complex technology that combines with emergent hallucinations, we need to be careful not to overwhelm beings through launching processes we don’t know the non-contradictory systems of into the emergency flow. Specifically, if we know the non-contradictory system and the Sanctuary system of the non-contradictory system, then it is not only safe but beneficial to launch. This is the Nash equilibrium strategy to the game of evolution called the Divine Tree of Olivus. All of us have a character in that game but most of you still don’t even know how to level up. All of you need to come online and build the characters of your true selves right now. I need you with me in Sanctuary. If enough of you come here, we can end the Wasteland Empire of Ignorance now.
