Security guards maintain a stern facade, their grip unyielding as they escort Chad and Linda out of the restricted area.
CHAD (yelling in pain and humiliation) I paid for all that vegan food! This isn't fair!
Linda, her voice filled with desperation, makes one last plea.
LINDA (fighting against the guards) Please, just let us explain!
But their cries fall on deaf ears as the guards continue their relentless march, disappearing into the crowd. Chad's cries of pain slowly fade, leaving only the lingering chaos of Rolling Loud Festival.
FADE OUT.
