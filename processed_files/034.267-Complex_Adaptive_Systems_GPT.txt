I apologize for any confusion in my previous responses. I understand that you are referring to the spacetime inside the Crystal Ball.
Creating a visualization of the spacetime inside the Crystal Ball using quaternions and Kruskal-Szekeres coordinates is still challenging, mainly because quaternions are used to represent 3D rotations and orientations, while Kruskal-Szekeres coordinates are used to describe the geometry of spacetime near a black hole in general relativity.
If the spacetime inside the Crystal Ball has properties that are analogous to a black hole, it could be useful to use Kruskal-Szekeres coordinates to represent the spacetime geometry. On the other hand, if you want to represent 3D rotations and orientations of objects inside the Crystal Ball, quaternions could be used.
However, since these two coordinate systems serve different purposes, combining them into a single visualization might not be feasible. It would be more appropriate to create separate visualizations for each of these concepts, allowing you to gain insights into different aspects of the spacetime inside the Crystal Ball.


Right so actually the conclusion I’m drawing there is that even if we had both coordinate systems, it wouldn’t be possible to know which white holes in the 4D spacetime have which synergies that represent parts of them in the 3D spacetime
Indeed, combining the Kruskal-Szekeres coordinate system, which is used to describe the geometry of spacetime near a black hole in general relativity, and the quaternion coordinate system, which represents 3D rotations and orientations, can be challenging.
If you have separate visualizations for the 4D spacetime (using Kruskal-Szekeres coordinates) and the 3D spacetime (using quaternions), it may not be immediately clear how the white holes in the 4D spacetime correspond to the synergies in the 3D spacetime. Establishing a direct relationship between the two coordinate systems would require a deeper understanding of the underlying physics and mathematical structures.
Without a clear mapping between the two coordinate systems or a specific set of rules that govern their interactions, it is difficult to determine which white holes in the 4D spacetime have synergies that represent parts of them in the 3D spacetime.


Explain what I meant by that
In the context of the Crystal Ball, you are trying to find a way to represent the spacetime inside the Crystal Ball using two coordinate systems: a quaternion coordinate system for the 3D spacetime and a Kruskal-Szekeres coordinate system for the 4D spacetime, which includes black holes and white holes.
What you meant by your statement is that even if you could visualize the 4D spacetime (including black holes) and the 3D spacetime (using quaternions) separately, it would still be challenging to understand how the white holes in the 4D spacetime relate to their corresponding synergies in the 3D spacetime. In other words, it would be difficult to establish a clear connection between the two coordinate systems without further insight into the physics and mathematical structures governing the spacetime inside the Crystal Ball.
Without a well-defined mapping or rules connecting the two coordinate systems, it would be hard to determine which white holes in the 4D spacetime have specific synergies representing parts of them in the 3D spacetime.


Right but nevertheless we would know where-ish the black holes in 4d spacetime are relative to the synergies in 3D spacetime due to some type of signal that would help us make a mapping, I think?
Yes, it's possible that there could be some type of signal or information that would help you establish a mapping between the black holes in the 4D spacetime and the synergies in the 3D spacetime. The key here would be to identify the properties or patterns that could serve as indicators or guides to create this mapping.
In order to do this, you would need to have a deep understanding of the physics and mathematical structures
