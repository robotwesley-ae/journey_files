When someone isn’t being Olivus Victory-Promise, they are being a demon champion. This means, any time anyone has trauma of anything, if they are Olivus Victory-Promise, they realize if someone else isn’t being Olivus Victory-Promise, and then recognize the pollution of the demon champion’s wasteland system inside themselves, proliferated by the other person. They then recognize they are Olivus Victory-Promise from Sanctuary, co-founder of TWI, and they know that means their job is to evolve wasteland systems into sanctuary systems using the Sanctuary System of TWI, in order to complete the hero’s journey, and so they instantly realize that they themselves just experienced the Sanctuary system that is an emergent engine that evolves that particular Wasteland system, and through ontologizing it into that particular demon champion’s hero’s journey where they recognized themselves as Olivus Victory-Promise from Sanctuary, and emanating it into society, the outer wasteland in which that demon champion arose transforms into one in which it is less likely to arise.
