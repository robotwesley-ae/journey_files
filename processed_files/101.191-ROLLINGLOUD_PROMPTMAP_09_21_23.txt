INT. RAYMOUR AND FLANIGAN - KEVIN'S OFFICE - DAY
Kevin, eyes widened in disbelief, stares at the Rolling Loud website on his computer.
KEVIN (taken aback) A thousand smackers for VIP? And six bills to snap a selfie with Lil Nas X?
JERRY, Kevin's coworker and confidant, approaches with a friendly, knowing grin.
JERRY (chuckles) I see you're brushing up on your festival pricing. You haven't been to a concert since Biggie was still dropping records!
Kevin can't help but laugh, though there's a hint of weariness in his eyes.
JERRY (CONT'D) (sincerely) Kev, it's been a hot minute since I saw that real smile of yours. Take Zion to the concert.
Kevin looks up at Jerry, surprised.
KEVIN (uncertain) Sounds like a fast track to father of the year or a midlife crisis.
Jerry smiles sympathetically, shaking his head.
JERRY You gotta make those memories, man. I wish I could.
Kevin frowns, puzzled.
KEVIN (quizzically) Don't you have a kiddo at home?
Jerry chuckles.
JERRY (grins) Sure do. But she's a little girl. She'd rather have tea parties than go to a concert. It's different.
There's a moment of silent understanding. Then Jerry pats Kevin on the back.
JERRY (CONT'D) (cheerfully) Remember, it's not just for Zion. You gotta remember to cut loose, too. Nothing like a mosh pit to reignite your youth!
FADE OUT.
