4. **Dual Loop Dynamics**: The interaction between the OMNISANC ENGINE (positive attractor circuit) and the WASTELAND ENGINE (indeterminate attractor circuit) forms a dual loop that drives the system's evolution. This can be modeled using dynamical systems theory, where the state of the system at any given time is influenced by these competing dynamics. Catastrophe theory might be applied to understand the conditions under which the system might transition into a catastrophic state (negative attractor circuit) and strategies for avoiding such outcomes.

5. **Co-Emergence and Transformation**: The ultimate goal of SANCREV is to navigate and transform the co-emergent space of Sanctuary and Wasteland, achieving a state of holistic development and victory. This process can be understood through the lens of emergent behavior in complex systems, where local interactions give rise to global patterns and properties. Computational models and simulations could be employed to explore the conditions under which positive co-emergence occurs and how entities can effectively navigate the SANCREVTWILITELANGMAP.

### Conclusion

The SANCREV framework, with its components of OMNISANC ENGINEERING and SANCREVTWILITELANGMAP, presents a visionary allegory for understanding and navigating the complexities of growth, knowledge, and transformation. While the narrative is rich with metaphor and allegory, theoretical modeling and computational approaches can offer insights into the dynamics at play, providing a bridge between the conceptual and the concrete. By applying principles from systems theory, network theory, dynamical systems, and computational modeling, it's possible to explore the mechanisms of co-emergence, adaptation, and transformation that underlie the SANCREV system.

so not only can each entity be considered an engine 

and each engine considered a flowchain

and each flowchain engine a mega-engine


an engine is an engine when a flowchain emerges from a chain and flow because chain and flow synergies are entities creating a larger entity, which is an engine, and an engine therefore requires a flowchain, so a flowchain and an engine are in a dual loop that instantiates both of them themselves, along with un-doing the conundrum of what an entity is and how it gets properties in the first place???????


But engine and flowchain mean the same thing IN THE SAME SENSE and yet CANNOT BE RECONCILED AS THE SAME ENTITY. that is the co-emergent principle and that is the principle of non-contradictory identitylessness, which is dual with contradictory identification which is the wasteland engine source. 

we can also liken every entity to a being and call it Olivus Victory-Promise from Sanctuary or Demon Champion from Wasteland. Because OVP is a flowchain that is an engine for SANCREV and Demon Champion from Wasteland is a flowchain that is an engine for ignorance.

So: entities arise as themselves because of what they come from and the totality of synergies in their shield. 

This is obvious, so how does it work? Because every entity is a flowchain, which means it is continuously flowing chains that are continously being chained by the flows in the intuition space being actualized by engines concatenating into larger emergents that can concatenate with smaller ones in dual loops to create new ones which in turn can concatenate. It doesnt even matter, apart from the fact that there is some kind of quaternary spinning of an engine due to its being a flowchain, which is that since it is continuously flowing chains, it can flow anything into its chains and can be effectively manipulated by any synergy with its shield.

anything that penetrates the shield can only do so because it belongs in the flowchain. this gives rise to the sanctuary and wasteland principles. the nature of the entity is indeterminate because the entity cannot be separated from its wasteland if it is in one and simultaneously cannot be separated from overall sanctuary but also cannot be in effective sanctuary if it is in a wasteland.
