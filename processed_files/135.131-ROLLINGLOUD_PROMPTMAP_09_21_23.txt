 predicament. The line crawls forward at a snail's pace.
KEVIN (to Chad and Linda) We need a distraction. Let's play 'Would You Rather.' Chad, you start.
Chad grunts, trying to distract himself from his own discomfort.
CHAD Okay, uh... Would you rather... be stuck in this line for another hour, or have to go on stage and perform with no preparation?
Linda chuckles, shaking her head.
LINDA Considering my current situation, I'd pick the stage in a heartbeat.
Finally, after what feels like an eternity, they reach the front. To their horror, every portapotty is occupied... except for one. They exchange panicked glances.
LINDA I can't believe I'm saying this, but...
KEVIN Yeah, me too. It's now or never, guys.
With grim determination, they squeeze into the single available portapotty, closing the door behind them. Their shared ordeal is far from over.
Expand on the following, filling in the dialogue instead of pros: INT. PORTAPOTTY - CONTINUOUS The smell is overwhelming. Kevin goes first, Chad and Linda look away. Chad follows, then Linda. Chad tries to encourage Linda. CHAD You got this, Linda! Hang in there! Kevin's phone RINGS. It's his wife, Melanie. She's yelling about something Zion said on a butt-dial call. KEVIN (into phone) No, no, we're at the theater... watching Avatar... Melanie insists on talking to Zion. Kevin lies, says Zion is in the bathroom stall next to him. Melanie demands to know which theater. Kevin makes up a theater far from their house, then tries to excuse what Zion said on the phone. Melanie doesn't believe him and gets furious.

INT. PORTAPOTTY - CONTINUOUS
The atmosphere is thick with an indescribable smell. Kevin grimaces, attempting to find relief first. Chad and Linda turn their backs, providing a semblance of privacy.
KEVIN (exhales) One down, two to go.
Chad follows, making a face as he switches places with Kevin.
CHAD (trying to sound brave) Okay, my turn.
Once Chad is done, Linda steps up, visibly struggling.
CHAD (encouraging) You got this, Linda! Hang in there!
Just then, Kevin's phone RINGS, startling all of them. The caller ID reads: "Melanie."
KEVIN (into phone, trying to sound calm) Hey, Melanie...
Melanie's voice is loud and angry, something about Zion saying something on a butt-dial call.
MELANIE (angry, over phone) Kevin, what the hell is Zion doing at the Rolling Loud festival?
Kevin panics.
KEVIN (into phone, improvising) No, no, we're at the theater... watching Avatar...
Melanie isn't convinced.
MELANIE (over phone) Put Zion on. Now.
Kevin sweats, glancing at Chad and Linda.
KEVIN (into phone, lying) Um, he's in the bathroom... the stall next to me...
Melanie demands more specifics.
MELANIE (over phone) Which theater, Kevin? And why would Zion talk about sneaking into the artist section?
Kevin thinks fast.
KEVIN (into phone) Uh, the... the CinemaX on 5th street. And about that... he's been really into his role-playing game. He must've been reciting some lines or something...
Melanie's silence on the other end tells Kevin she isn't buying it.
MELANIE (over phone) I'm getting in the car, Kevin. If you're not at that theater...
Kevin gulps, the walls of the portapotty suddenly feeling much too close.
KEVIN (into phone, desperate) Melanie, wait...
The call ends. Kevin hangs his head, the weight of their situation sinking in.

EXT. PORTAPOTTY AREA
As a random festival-goer steps out of a portapotty, Kevin, Chad, and Linda spring into action. They sprint towards it, shoving past an unsuspecting punk who stands in their way.
