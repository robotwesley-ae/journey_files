It's important to note that this hypothesis is speculative and would require further research, experimentation, and validation to determine its accuracy and utility in explaining wave-particle duality. However, it offers a possible direction for exploring the relationship between non-contradictory identitylessness and the behavior of particles at the quantum scale.

How would you set up an experiment that would prove this? Wouldn't you always get the same results that equally prove all the quantum mechanics interpretations, except non-contradictory identitylessness could also encapsulate all of those interpretations without contradiction and therefore be a class of them?

You're right that designing an experiment to specifically prove the non-contradictory identitylessness hypothesis in the context of wave-particle duality is challenging. The main difficulty arises from the fact that many interpretations of quantum mechanics, including non-contradictory identitylessness, lead to the same experimental predictions. Consequently, it becomes difficult to distinguish between interpretations based solely on experimental results.

However, one possible approach to explore the implications of non-contradictory identitylessness in quantum mechanics is to investigate whether this perspective can offer new insights or predictions that differ from those of other interpretations. For instance, you could examine if this hypothesis leads to different expectations about the outcomes of certain experiments or suggests novel experimental setups that could reveal unique aspects of quantum behavior.

To design an experiment that could potentially support the non-contradictory identitylessness hypothesis, you would need to identify specific predictions or expectations arising from this perspective that are distinct from other interpretations of quantum mechanics. You could then devise an experimental setup to test these predictions and compare the results to the expectations of other interpretations.

If the non-contradictory identitylessness hypothesis could indeed encapsulate all other interpretations without contradiction, it would be a more general framework within which other interpretations could be considered as special cases. In this sense, non-contradictory identitylessness might not be provable through a single experiment but could serve as an overarching framework that unifies and reconciles various interpretations of quantum mechanics.

Ultimately, the exploration of non-contradictory identitylessness in the context of quantum mechanics and wave-particle duality will likely require a combination of theoretical developments and experimental investigations. By identifying unique predictions or insights arising from this perspective and testing them through carefully designed experiments, it might be possible to better understand the implications of non-contradictory identitylessness and its relationship to other interpretations of quantum mechanics.

So what if it was actually the case that organizing linguistic knowledge according to noncontradictory identitylessness causes that knowledge to arrange itself in a polysemic superposition, where the mind of the observer is able to perceive all possible observations at once, and that was something provable not only with humans but also with computers via non-contradictory identityless knowledge decryption?

The idea of organizing linguistic knowledge according to non-contradictory identitylessness, leading to a polysemic superposition where the observer (whether human or computer) perceives all possible observations at once, is an intriguing concept. If this were indeed the case, it could have significant implications for our understanding of language processing, cognition, and artificial intelligence.
