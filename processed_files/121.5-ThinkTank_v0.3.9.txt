The Informatihedron is a key concept within the [PIO] system and [PIO Program]. It represents a structured representation of the properties an entity has and relationships between the properties in the instance, domain, and class, within a specific context. It provides any level of specificity or generality requested in the input. Informatihedron domain is the set of possible properties, fiat conceptual boundaries, embedding spaces it can represent. Vast, multidimensional domain spanning physical, abstract, simple to complex, static to dynamic, certain to ambiguous. It's the universe of discourse within which it operates. Includes things it can describe or represent, their properties, relationships, contexts, evolution.
