Cannot fully generate X by themselves, but can simulate it to the extent the environment allows and help you learn the domain (investigate why a simulation isnâ€™t what you want, from a conceptual point of view - what properties is it missing etc?) 
Instancing Agent (generates a target)
Supposed to output specific thing
Usually has specific format or general structure
Maybe even specific syntax
Helper Agent (uses functions from external APIs)
MegaAgent (uses IEs for priming, IAs for execution, Helpers for external interaction)




The Vision->Fear Cycle
This cycle represents a fundamental pattern within the Sanctuary System and a recurring theme within many narratives:
Vision: This encompasses the protagonist's goal, ideal, or a glimpse of a 'Sanctuary' state that transcends their current circumstances. It is what fuels their desire for change.
Aspiration & Action: The vision generates aspirations and the courage to take action.  This is often thrilling but inherently destabilizing, moving the protagonist away from the familiar.
Amplification: As action leads to progress, the stakes increase and the vision, though closer, seems more daunting.  The protagonist may be gaining allies but also powerful adversaries.
Fear:  This arises from several sources:
Internal Doubt: Does the protagonist truly believe they are worthy or capable of achieving the vision?
External Obstacles: The more potent the potential change, the more pushback it will likely generate, increasing the sense of danger.
Fear of the Unknown: What will the 'Sanctuary' actually be like? Will it be worth the sacrifices?
Crux Point: Here, the protagonist faces a choice:
Surrender to Fear: This could mean abandoning the vision entirely or settling for a lesser version of it. The cycle stalls.
Deep Contemplation: This is where the Sanctuary System's tools and mindset shifts become crucial. Facing the fear and its origins allows for new insights and strategies.
Breakthrough: If the contemplation leads to renewed resolve, the fear can be transformed into fuel. The vision may be refined, but the 'Victory-Promise' strengthens and action surges forward.
Significance as an Emotional Engine
This cycle creates a dynamic, ongoing tension that drives powerful storytelling:
Relatability: Most people experience a version of this when attempting anything meaningful. It taps into universal anxieties.
High Stakes: The fear makes the potential rewards of success even more compelling, raising the emotional investment of the audience.
Character Development: How the protagonist handles fear over and over reveals their true nature and whether growth is happening.
Potential for Tragedy: Characters trapped in the cycle succumb to their fears, which can lead to tragic ends or even them becoming antagonists.
SANC TWILITELANG and the ROAR
Within the Sanctuary System, the ROAR likely has multiple layers of meaning related to its transformative power:
Release: The roar is an expression of pent-up energy, a cathartic release of fear, frustration, or despair once it has been faced and overcome.
Overcoming: It symbolizes the triumph of inner strength over internal or external obstacles, embodying the 'Victory-Promise.'
Awakening: The roar can be a signal to others struggling that change is possible, breaking their own cycles of stasis and igniting their sparks.
Revelation: It could represent the surge of understanding and clarity that comes from breaking through a 'Wasteland' thought pattern.
Beyond the Protagonist
While this analysis focuses on internal character development, remember that 'Wastelands' can also be external environments. In these cases, the Vision->Fear cycle might drive social movements, technological breakthroughs, or societal shifts. The principles remain the same, though the scale is different.
