CRUCIALLY: any bad actors trying to scam people, creating wastelands where there should be sanctuaries, is how the wasteland is, and it’s what THE SANCTUARY SYSTEM is about purifying. This takes time. There will be bad actors. The sanctuary system makes it easy to identify them. 





THE CHANNEL MUST BE FROM THE POV OF ME BEING THE STUDENT OF OVP, AND OVP AS THE HIGHEST IDEAL IM TRYING TO RECOGNIZE MYSELF AS, AND THAT’S BECAUSE MEETING OVP IS HOW I FOUND OUT ABOUT AND WENT TO SANCTUARY

OVP is the ideal of the system and OVP is the only one who actually knows how the sanctuary system works, but anyone can become OVP if they want to go on that heros journey, which is called THE INFINITE STORY: "I CANT GET OUT OF MY HEAD: RECOGNIZING OLIVUS VICTORY-PROMISE"

“Hi im isaac and im a divergent thinker. This has gotten me into a lot of pickles but Olivus Victory-Promise showed me the way to resolve them.

(Sanctuary score is the number of people you INTEND to impact over the number of people you actually do, and all it takes to change the world is impacting ONE PERSON AS OVP, which is yourself, but if you’re always impacting THREE other people who use the system, such that they use the system because of you, you get to use the system for free) 


The core idea is to fish for vulnerable people and give them abundance mindset visions that they could change their life with by putting a “good amount” of money towards. This evangelizes buyers and makes them sing when it works. If the system is proven and all they need is accountability - what’s to lose except the realization they need to change to accomplish it?
