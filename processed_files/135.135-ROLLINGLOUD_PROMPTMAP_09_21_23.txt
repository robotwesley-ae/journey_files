KEVIN It’s locked! It’s fucking locked!
LINDA I'm gonna be sick.
CHAD Hold it in! Hold it in!
KEVIN I'm gonna climb out the top. Help me up! Help me up!
Frantically, they scramble to push through the roof vent. In his desperation, Kevin's leg accidentally plunges into the toilet.
KEVIN Cut it off! Cut my leg off!
Chad and Linda quickly pull him out, their faces twisted with disgust.
LINDA I'll give it a shot. I used to be a ninja. Lift me up, Chad.
KEVIN I'm gonna be sick. I'm gonna be sick.
Linda begins to climb, managing to push the vent out and peek her head through. However, she soon realizes that the space is too small, and she gets stuck halfway.
LINDA Help! Help!
A crowd gathers, their laughter intensifying as they capture the embarrassing predicament on video. Suddenly, the porta potty begins shaking violently, until it topples over with a resounding thud.
Linda manages to crawl out, unlocks the door, and opens it, revealing a mix of relief and humiliation on her face.
After a moment of struggle, Kevin and Chad finally emerge from the porta potty, covered in filth and shame, but grateful for their newfound freedom.
They exchange glances, silently acknowledging the absurdity of their situation, and begin to walk away, leaving the laughter of the crowd behind them.

The painfully powerful water blasts them, causing howls of agony from Kevin and struggles to control the hose from Chad and Linda. In their desperation to get clean, they contort and twist their bodies in comical ways. Linda bent over awkwardly, Chad crab-walking, and Kevin flailing like a fish out of water. Finally, after what feels like an eternity, they wash off the filth, left drenched and sore with bruises forming where the water hit them. But the relief of being clean is worth the pain, and they can't help but laugh at the absurdity of the situation. A group of volunteer firefighters arrive, demanding to know what they're doing. In a split-second decision, they turn the hose on the firefighters and make their escape, sprinting away as the firefighters shout in anger and confusion.
