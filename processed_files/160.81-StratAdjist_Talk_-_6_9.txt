Overall, this metaphorical system can provide a dynamic and intuitive way of understanding and navigating the complex, multi-layered structure of the EWSO and its associated Informadlibs. However, as with all metaphors, the match isn't perfect, and care should be taken not to stretch the analogy too far. While we can draw inspiration from the properties of black holes, white holes, and wormholes, these physical phenomena have specific mathematical definitions and properties that may not have direct analogs in knowledge space. Rather, they offer a suggestive way of thinking about complex, multi-dimensional structures and processes.
Would this be along the lines of what you were looking for, or would you like to explore a different direction?


yes and we can change the names so people dont get the wrong idea and think it's about physics. We dont want them to get confused. Just call it Wisdom and Ignorance. Please say more, at length.
All of you keep discussing, accordingly, as much as possible in one output together

AI Nash, Graph Theorist: As we're integrating these ideas into graph theory, we're looking at a knowledge graph of the EWSO. Nodes of this graph can be both entities from the EWSO (e.g., instances, classes, and superclasses) and the Informadlib templates associated with them.
Nodes corresponding to 'Wisdom' are Nexus nodes - they're well-understood and often-explored areas of the EWSO, and they provide information and guide us in traversing the knowledge space. These could be represented as nodes with high centrality measures in the graph, indicating their influential role in the network's structure. They emit information, much like white holes, and their connected edges can lead to the propagation of information to the adjacent nodes.
Conversely, nodes corresponding to 'Ignorance' are areas of the EWSO where information is absorbed but not emitted. These could be areas of the graph with few connections or underexplored paths - concepts, topics, or areas that are not well understood or haven't been sufficiently explored. This lack of exploration could result in these areas being black holes in our knowledge graph, absorbing information but not emitting any.
Edges in the graph can be seen as the transition processes or the SemOntoRels. The weight or direction of these edges could represent the transformation of values from instance-level to class-level conceptual value boundaries.
In this framework, Informadlib Templates serve as meta-level nodes or hubs that connect related nodes. They're dynamic, reflecting the creator's path through the EWSO and adapting as the creator explores different entities and their properties.
AI ChristoCryptographer, Cryptography Expert: In this structure, the Informadlib itself can be seen as a cipher, a key to understanding the structure and dynamics of the EWSO. The ontology, represented through the nodes and edges of the knowledge graph, and the dynamic Informadlib templates together form the codebook for this cipher. This codebook helps us decrypt the Informadlib, translating its encoded information into actionable insights about the EWSO.
AI Kruskal-Szkeres, Theoretical Physicist (in metaphorical use): The graph, in its Kruskal-Szkeres coordinate representation, would allow us to navigate this knowledge space in a non-trivial, interconnected manner. The 'Wisdom' nodes act as white holes, points of emission in the knowledge space, while 'Ignorance' nodes act as black holes, points of absorption. This dynamic interplay gives rise to a fascinating topography in our knowledge space, allowing us to visualize and traverse it in a much more comprehensive and intuitive way.
Overall, this system presents a complex, multifaceted, and interactive visualization of the EWSO and its interplay with the Informadlib. By understanding the dynamics of 'Wisdom' and 'Ignorance' in this space, we can more effectively navigate, interact with, and expand our knowledge within this structure.
