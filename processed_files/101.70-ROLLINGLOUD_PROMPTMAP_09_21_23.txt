 of security press down on him, but he knows he can't give up until he finds his son.
As Kevin searches for Zion, he can't shake the feeling that he's being watched. He turns around to see a security guard on his tail, radio in hand. The guard warns Kevin that if he doesn't turn himself in, they'll be forced to call child protective services.
Kevin feels the weight of his mistake bearing down on him as he realizes the gravity of the situation. He knows that he needs to find Zion and make things right before it's too late.

Rewrite the following, but include the call to child protective services as a threat before the "cuff him" part: "Kevin rushes up to the receptionist in the security room, sweat dripping down his face as he frantically explains that his son is missing. The receptionist begins taking down the report, her fingers flying over the keyboard as she asks for his son's age. Just as Kevin is about to answer, the security guard who had initially rejected them bursts into the room, his expression incredulous as he spots Kevin. Feeling the pressure, Kevin decides to stick to his lie that his son is 16. However, the first security guard re-enters the room and confronts Kevin about previously telling him that his son was 13. Kevin's face turns red with embarrassment, realizing he's caught in a lie. He takes a deep breath and decides to come clean, admitting that his son is actually 13. He feels defensive as the security guards criticize his parenting choices, but he explains that he didn't realize there was an age restriction and that he just wanted to bond with his son over their shared love of music. The security guards become increasingly offended, accusing Kevin of breaking the rules and putting his son in danger. The first security guard's voice rises as he points out that Kevin committed a violation of Section 273a of the Penal Code by providing false information and willfully placing his child in a situation where his health and safety could be compromised. Kevin tries to reason with them, insisting that he just wants to find his son. But as the guards move to cuff him, Kevin's panic kicks in. In a desperate move, he pushes one of them aside and manages to slip away, running back into the festival crowd. His heart races as he realizes he's now a wanted man, but his primary focus remains on finding his son. He dodges through the crowd, his eyes scanning the faces of festival-goers as he searches for Zion. The weight of his mistakes and the looming threat of security press down on him, but he knows he can't give up until he finds his son."
