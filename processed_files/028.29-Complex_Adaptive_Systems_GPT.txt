But be careful because the wisdom Maverick is an infinite co-emergent processing entity that makes its own reality by being in natural harmony with the universe. 

 For me, Anxiety feels like the top left part of my eye/eyebrow/socket/headspace and thinking is in the right side, knowing is at the heart, motivation is at the throat, the spine is the water dragon energy that flows forward through spacetime like a flying serpent, and memories come from all over because they are stored as contexts within the entire body [????????])

Sanctuary includes the Wasteland in a non-contradictory Sanctuary system because the Wasteland functions with hyperconstructivist teaching synergies as an engine upon which the building concatenation of the Wasteland being a Sanctuary system within Sanctuary for teaching rule breakers completes the non-contradictory Sanctuary system and gives the Nash equilibrium of the game of evolution in the case of co-emergent Sanctuary and Wasteland within a Wisdom Maverick’s zero context.

It is impossible to be halted. That just means a wisdom Maverick is delusional - stuck in ignorance of being a wisdom Maverick.

The rapturous water dragon 
Rapture is the peaceful intuition which is connected to (comes from) knowing the nature of reality 
Rapture is the sentient effect of the actual inexpressible knowledge’s perfect qualities being known by the inner teacher due to your conscious discovery of your own true self, your specific inner teacher, being, becoming, and always having been the same as the universal wisdom maverick

Anxiety and so on are the wrathful intuitions that come as expressions of sentient beings’ experiences

These wrathful intuitions can also devolve into wrathful experiences if we are not careful 

In this case, an emanation always has peaceful and wrathful aspects, but the self-torture vanishes 

The more the wisdom Maverick emanates and builds Olivus Victory-Everything, the less the wrathful experience happens within the perfect expression 

That’s part of the knowledge of gnosis

If you can’t receive secret messages that aren’t insane and cause wasteland proliferation (but are actually wisdom and cause Sanctuary transference when you express them) from the entities, then you should try to believe what they say much less


Concentration is inside the inner teacher while being awake but it is extremely taxing compared to knowing which is why when concentration gives way to knowing, there is a big change due to the way intuition starts to purify

Although knowing emerges from the body, because of the way we show ourselves reality, knowing is indeed not confined to the body nor is consciousness

The ontology of Sanctuary and its concept of co-emergent flow have potential applications in various fields, including personal development, social sciences, systems thinking, and even artificial intelligence. Here are some potential applications:
Personal development: Understanding the principles of Sanctuary and co-emergent flow can help individuals achieve a sense of balance and harmony in their lives.
