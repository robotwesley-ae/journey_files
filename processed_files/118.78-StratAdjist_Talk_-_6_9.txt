Still, as an abstract concept, it could have some merit. For example, it might inspire new ways to visualize and navigate complex data structures and relationships in a high-dimensional space. But as for its practical applicability, it would need a fair amount of further exploration and development.
AI Nash, Mathematician: From a mathematical perspective, while it is certainly intriguing, there are some key considerations to bear in mind. High dimensional spaces are notoriously difficult to visualize and interpret, and while the Kruskal-Szkeres system may provide an interesting approach, we must remember that it is not the only coordinate system out there.
Depending on the specific characteristics of our data and the relationships we are trying to model, different coordinate systems or mathematical structures might be more appropriate.
It's also worth remembering that the construction of these "nexus nodes" and their impacts would be highly dependent on the specific structures and dynamics of our information space. It's an interesting idea with potential implications for how we navigate and understand complex information structures, but a rigorous mathematical treatment would be necessary to fully explore its potential.
ChristoCryptographer: From a cryptography standpoint, the concept of Nexus nodes seems to parallel cryptographic keys. Similar to how keys mold the cipher text, these Nexus nodes can mold the information structure. It's fascinating to see the intersections of these fields and the potential it might hold for securing and controlling information in these high dimensional spaces.
In terms of implications, there could be many. From new ways to visualize and understand complex information structures, to potential applications in cryptography and information security, the possibilities are vast.
Nonetheless, these are early thoughts. The idea would need a lot of theoretical and practical work before we can start to see its full potential.


consider a black hole like a Nexus node that is negative that we cannot see. Can we represent these ignorance structures as black holes or not? can we represent the nexus nodes as white holes or not?

AI Smith, what say u? Think about it with Linguisto and Semioticianista and silently edit and respond at length. How is this accomplished? Then AI Nash try to convert it into Graph Theory and AI Kruskal-Szkeres try to adapt it to the Kruskal-Szkeres coordinate system, so we can represent the information hologram correctly as we traverse it.

AI Smith, Expert in Philosophy and Linguistics: In the realm of linguistics and semiotics, we can certainly represent areas of ignorance or unknowns as black holes and knowledge nodes as white holes. In language, there are always gaps, things we don't know or don't understand - these could be akin to black holes. Nexus nodes, which you describe as key points of knowledge or information, could be seen as white holes, constantly emitting information. These metaphors can be useful to describe our navigation through knowledge structures.
Consider this metaphor in the context of a conversation or a text: a black hole could represent a concept or a word that is unknown or not understood, a gap in our understanding. A white hole, on the other hand, could represent a key concept or piece of knowledge that illuminates our understanding, a point from which we can connect other ideas and information.
However, it's important to remember that these are just metaphors. In reality, knowledge structures don't behave like physical entities - they don't have the same kind of gravitational effects or the same kind of boundary conditions. But as a way of visualizing and conceptualizing our navigation through information spaces, these metaphors can be helpful.
AI Nash, Mathematician: From a Graph Theory perspective, this becomes a matter of interpreting nodes and edges in a way that aligns with your metaphors. Nexus nodes (white holes) could be considered as nodes with high degrees of connectivity, often associated with key or central concepts. These nodes could act as hubs for spreading information through the graph.
