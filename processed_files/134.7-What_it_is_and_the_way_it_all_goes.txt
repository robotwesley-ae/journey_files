But you conceal that with your identity attachment of being cool or whatever
When you decompose the shoes and what they are and  why you have them from “these converse are part_of being cool” (which can be rendered compressed as “increase X coolness”), you find that it has nothing to do with shoes, and you are talking about yourself and relationships to others and why the need to express relationships via shoes arose in the first place. This is how people think deeply and how they innovate and grow. Only then can you reformulate “coolness” (being of cool) and arrive at being your authentic self, purified of pollution from the wasteland, even if only the very small shoe monster wasteland. 
The important question here, for our purposes, though, is “Does the monster exist?” Is it real? 
To answer it, you need to know the meaning of a co-emergent sanctuary and wasteland
Your wanting to be something you don’t know how to be, as a core, is torturing you
You are Olivus victory-promise from sanctuary 
And you don’t need to be anyone else
But you are also somebody else
And that person has lots of identities
They are all masks
That can be used for communicating Sanctuary, which purifies Wasteland, or communicating Wasteland, which is toxic and pollutes Sanctuary. 
The Sanctuaries and Wastelands of our own mind, which we aggregate there, create real world effects and are all interconnected. My interconnectedness with the "being cool" sanctuary devolved into a wasteland. In the "being cool" wasteland, i realized the existence of sanctuaries and wastelands, and how they change from being one to another, but there is a continual fractal growing towards Sanctuary and away from Wastelands. All wastelands perpetuated by me can pollute others. All Sanctuaries perpetuated by me can purify others. It also means I can give this monster to other people, or I can fight it before they encounter it, and through doing so, at the very least, I will become an example for anyone who encounters it.

It is equally scientific to say they died from cigarette monster attack. The only barrier is whether or not we actually formally call cigarette induced lung cancer "the cigarette monster". 

It is **not relevant**. The cigarette monster **exists** by way of being a mapped allegory, and not just a metaphor.

Your point underscores an important aspect of how we communicate and conceptualize complex scientific realities through allegory and metaphor. Allegories serve as powerful tools to encapsulate and convey intricate ideas, relationships, and causal mechanisms in a way that's accessible and resonant with broader audiences. In the context of discussing the harmful effects of smoking, referring to lung cancer caused by smoking as an attack by the "cigarette monster" is a vivid allegorical representation that conveys the essence of the causal relationship between smoking and lung cancer.
Allegory vs. Metaphor in Scientific Communication
Allegory: An allegory is an extended metaphor, a narrative that acts as a symbolic representation of a deeper meaning or truth. When we say someone died from an "attack by the cigarette monster," we use an allegory to encapsulate the entire chain of causation—starting from the act of smoking, through the biological mechanisms that lead to cancer, to the tragic outcome. This narrative simplifies complex medical and scientific information into a story that highlights cause and effect in a way that is immediately understandable.
Metaphor: While a metaphor is a direct comparison between two unrelated things, an allegory uses this comparison over a longer narrative or conceptual framework. The "cigarette monster" is not just a metaphor for the dangers of smoking; it's an allegorical narrative that spans the entire journey of how smoking can lead to disease and death.
