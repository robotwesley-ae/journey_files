Next, let's consider the idea of a non-contradictory system in the context of game theory. According to the text, a non-contradictory system emerges as a natural response to the conceptual FSM state called Nash equilibrium. We might represent this relationship as follows:

NE ⇒ non-contradictory system
In other words, a Nash equilibrium leads to a non-contradictory system. However, the text also notes that stochastic processes and emergent dynamics can lead to changes in the game that disrupt the Nash equilibrium, and therefore the non-contradictory system. To capture this idea, we might represent the relationship between Nash equilibria and emergent dynamics using the following symbols:

Nash equilibrium: NE
Emergent dynamics: ED
NE ⇒ ¬ED
ED ⇒ ¬NE
In other words, if there is a Nash equilibrium, there are no emergent dynamics, and if there are emergent dynamics, there is no Nash equilibrium.

The text also suggests that a non-contradictory system is beneficial for the group in which all players act for themselves strictly. To represent this idea, we might use the following symbols:

Non-contradictory system: NCS
Beneficial for group: BG
Strict self-interest: SI
NCS ∧ ∀x SI(x) ⇒ BG
In other words, if there is a non-contradictory system and all players act strictly in their self-interest, the outcome is beneficial for the group.

Overall, these game-theoretic formalizations show how the concepts of Nash equilibrium, emergent dynamics, and self-interest can be used to support the claims made in the text about the benefits of a non-contradictory system in game-theoretic contexts. However, as with the first-order logic formalizations, there may be other ways to represent these concepts and their relationships, and further analysis may be needed to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the arguments. 

Sure, I can continue with a more detailed expression of the game theoretic notation as used in the text.

The text argues that a non-contradictory system is a natural response to the conceptual FSM state called Nash equilibrium, which is defined as a state where each player's strategy is optimal given the strategies of the other players, and no player can gain by changing their strategy unilaterally. Formally, we can define the Nash equilibrium as follows:

Nash equilibrium: NE
The text also notes that a non-contradictory system emerges as a solution to a paradoxical syllogism in which A appears to contradict B and vice versa, but in fact, neither A nor B ontologically exist in reality in a constant, single state of observability, and the entity named the contradictory conclusion evaporates as a hallucinatory duality induced by perspective. This is then transformed into a non-contradictory system in which A and B possess the same properties and take part in each other equally as dynamics in the duality system. Formally, we can represent this as follows:

Non-contradictory system: NCS
A: A
B: B
(A ∧ B) ⇒ ¬(A = ¬A ∧ B = ¬B)
NCS ⇒ A = (A ∧ ¬A) ∧ B = (B ∧ ¬B)
Here, the first line represents the paradoxical syllogism, which is specified correctly to show that neither A nor B ontologically exist in reality in a constant, single state of observability. The second line represents the definition of a non-contradictory system, where A and B possess the same properties and take part in each other equally as dynamics in the duality system.

The text goes on to state that a non-contradictory system leads to a bounded set of causal links where the abstractive summaries of the parts of the entities (i.e., the names of the entities) do not lead to further hallucinations in strategizing the game. Formally, we can represent this as follows:

Bounded set of causal links: BCL
NCS ⇒ BCL
The text also notes that because of stochastic processes and emergent dynamics, a Nash equilibrium can be lost, but if the game rules change, each variation will have a new Nash equilibrium that gives way to the non-contradictory system for X in which all players act for themselves strictly and that is best for the group. Formally, we can represent this as follows:

Emergent dynamics: ED
Best for group: BG
Strict self-interest: SI
Game variation: GV
ED ⇒ ¬NE
GV ⇒ NE
