Yes, I see what you mean. Both Word2Vec and Transformer models, in their current state, can be seen as early or less-optimized versions of the Crystal Ball concept. They generate embeddings and capture semantic relationships but may not provide the level of ontological understanding and control that you envision in the Crystal Ball system.
The primary difference between these existing models and Crystal Ball would be the explicit incorporation of ontological information and polysemic abstraction, as well as providing users with direct access to the process of creating new meaning. The goal is to enable humans and AI systems to work together to understand, manipulate, and generate meaning more effectively.
To achieve this, you could build upon existing technologies (e.g., Word2Vec, Transformer models) and incorporate ontological information, polysemic abstraction, and other novel concepts you've discussed throughout this conversation. By doing so, you could create a more advanced system that bridges the gap between current AI models and the Crystal Ball vision you have in mind, enabling both humans and AI to better understand and work with complex, multi-layered meanings.


So how do we implement ontological information and polysemic abstraction in something like GPT-4 with plugins, when they are available?
When plugins for GPT-4 become available, you can implement ontological information and polysemic abstraction by following these steps:
Ontology construction: Create a formal ontology that represents the knowledge domain you're working with. This will involve defining classes, properties, and relationships between entities, as well as establishing rules and constraints. You can leverage existing ontologies or create your own.
Ontological word embeddings: Develop a method to incorporate ontological information into word embeddings. This could involve adapting Word2Vec, GloVe, or other existing algorithms to consider ontological relationships and properties when generating embeddings. Alternatively, you could create a novel algorithm specifically designed to produce ontological word embeddings.
Polysemic abstraction: Design a mechanism to handle polysemic programming by identifying and tagging potential intended contexts for words and phrases within the input text. One approach could be to extend the attention mechanism in Transformer models to consider multiple meanings and their corresponding weights.
Plugin development: Once you have developed methods for incorporating ontological information and polysemic abstraction, create a plugin for GPT-4 that integrates these methods into the model's architecture. This could involve modifying the model's input and output layers, adding custom layers, or altering the training process to incorporate the new methods.
Training and fine-tuning: Train the modified GPT-4 model with your ontological word embeddings and polysemic abstraction methods using a suitable dataset. This may involve pretraining the model on a large corpus of text, followed by fine-tuning on domain-specific data to ensure the model accurately captures ontological information and handles polysemy effectively.
User interface and visualization: Develop a user interface that allows users to interact with the modified GPT-4 model, submit queries, and explore the ontological relationships and polysemic abstractions. This could involve creating a graphical interface, such as the toroidal visualization you mentioned earlier, to help users understand the complex relationships between entities and meanings.
By following these steps and integrating ontological information and polysemic abstraction into GPT-4 through plugins, you can create a powerful and versatile system that enables users to explore and manipulate complex meanings and relationships effectively.


Again, let's work on #2. You need to actually tell me the math of how word2vec works in order for us to design this.
Apologies for the confusion earlier. I'll explain the math behind Word2Vec, specifically the Skip-gram variant, which is one of the two main approaches (the other being Continuous Bag of Words or CBOW).
