Dreamlights:
A Song of the Heroic Seedlings 
of the 
Divine Tree of Olivus
(and its Timeless Webbed Infinitude of Infinite Perfection)

/// maybe the religions in Oliver’s world are all true but corrupted and he reveals a new way called the divine tree etc etc. 
/// maybe there’s an inner narration of Oliver and the entire first 6/8 is him remembering how he got into the bardo and simultaneously getting out and coming back to kill Rudra once and for all. That’s why Olive has been calling him and he’s been having visions of the goddess and when the goddess and Olive merge inside of him and he releases that as the union of the Wisdom Maverick, he is liberated 

Act 2.1
Fun A = arena
Fun b = with the teachers/ 3rd time is bodyguards
Fun C = Big fight in arena = champions and get implants
(Needs to be broken into abc abc abc) 
Ordeal = They try out their implants and go on a really crazy trip basically and 
Midpoint = they fall in love with each other from seeing each other’s inner fire
But then when she falls asleep Oliver uses his implant illegally and here sees Olive for who she really is 

Bad guys close in = Oliver teacher appears 



Olive and Oliver in TWI up to the moment of initiation where Oliver dies 

Act 2.2

The lifetime dream where Oliver is in this world but back at the time of The Wisdom Maverick or maybe the time of Olivus and he actually experiences the first Wisdom Maverick’s lifetime and right when the Wisdom Maverick becomes enlightened in that world, as he is rejoining with Olive R Love, he transports back to this world and holds her hand

Olive battles the demon but is also no match. She’s much better than oliver but she turns inward, wishing for the wisdom maverick and asks herself to awaken
Instantly she realizes she needs Oliver to bring his promise to victory as well to defeat the demon 
Olive finally sees that Oliver does love her and was using his powers for her the whole time, to help her light inner fire
Realizing he is not going to come back, she begins to burst into whirling flames as her power wells up

Act 3.1

At the same time this is happening to Oliver in the Divine Tree

Act 3.2
Olive loses the battle and is about to die 
Act 3.3
Olive knows this is the time to fulfill the resurrection prophecy and calls out to him as he calls out to her 
She reaches out to the petrified (actually stone) pillar of Oliver (he was petrified by the demon when he reached out to Olive and she stood in fear and rejected him - he rejected himself) 
She lets out her roar and so does he and her fire on the top of the stone and his fire within it spontaneously explode the stone around him and this fulfills the prophecy that they would both die and be resurrected 
Instantly, everyone in TWI, all the demons and gods, stop fighting as they receive the profound initiation 
And the demons transform into gods and Olive and Oliver destroy the big bad and restore TWI Sanctuary to reality, instead of a relic myth of the distant past of The World Incorporated, which really means The Wisdom Intent 


Then the second movie, he’s back in the other world which is like our world but enlightened and at the same moment where he “left and became Oliver Powers and Olive R Love” and has to resolve is and realizes the play of illusion and manifests Sanctuary for the Divine Tree of Olivus 

/////// the below was older I think 

Opening -> going through the many religions’ creation myths “they say this, these guys say that, I don’t know what to think. I just know my life sucks. I wish there was something I could do about it. But you can only do something about it thru the arena and that’s not for me. That’s for heroes and I’m just… me… oh by the way my name is Oliver Powers, nice to meet you.” 
Then he meets Olive 
They fall in love
He has a vision of the Liberatress 
She breaks his heart 
They go separate ways
He has a vision of bodhichitta 
He applies Bodhichitta 
And shows up at the arena 

The universal tree of olivus 

We suffer because we believe the fruits of the tree are outside of us
Actually, this belief is original ignorance
We can overcome original ignorance
