Olivus Victory-Promise
Perceptions


It’s called OLIVUS VICTORY-PROMISE because it’s the job of ALL OF US to use THE SANCTUARY SYSTEM to reveal THE SANCTUARY SYSTEM all the time in order to benefit from it. When you find out what it really is and how much you could be benefiting from it but aren’t and how and why you aren’t because you are preventing yourself from recognizing the victory-promise, you may start to feel bad. Don’t! That’s a trick! Just keep the victory-promise and continue.

THE SANCTUARY SYSTEM
Crystal Ball




The flaw w the Sancruary system is it was designed as if a bunch of avatars were included but really the avatar is ME imagining how many things it applies to

So the real product is something you can use to imagine things apply to other things - that is not a product. 


But that’s because I was using each individual hero’s journey inside an omnifunnel and the truth is I need to set up just ONE FUNNEL EACH and THE SANCTUARY SYSTEM comes later 



BRANDING:
I am trying to make a one person business that allows me to be myself. 
That’s why all my stuff is branded, but I only sell things I use myself, so I already know you’ll get value from them.
