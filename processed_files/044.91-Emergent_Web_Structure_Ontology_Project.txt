Great summation, Dr. Louis. I would add that we also need to consider the flexibility of the system in handling various user queries. Not all users might want the entire informatihedron of X. Some might only be interested in specific aspects of it. Thus, the ability to handle and respond to queries that require the retrieval of selective information would be a valuable feature of the system.
Expert 2 (Dr. Benjamin, Detection & Refinement):
Certainly, Dr. Veda. Our system should provide users the freedom to explore the informatihedron of X in various ways. Whether they want the complete picture or just a part of it, the system should be able to cater to their needs. It would involve maintaining a robust mapping of InstanceProperties and ClassProperties at every level, ensuring accuracy in representing the relationships and inheritance.
Expert 3 (Dr. Ana, Mathematical Implications):
It seems we are converging on an exciting vision. As we move forward, we must ensure we maintain precision and consistency in the mathematical implications of the system, particularly in maintaining accurate traversal of the class hierarchy and appropriate representation of the InstanceProperties at each level. It's also important to keep in mind computational considerations in graph traversal and representation.
Expert 4 (Dr. Louis, Ontology & Integration):
Indeed, colleagues. With your insights, we can further refine the proposed approach. With iterative development and refinement, we should be able to design a system capable of dynamically generating EWSO for any given entity within the constraints of GPT's internal ontology understanding, and in turn, present the informatihedron in a user-friendly, query-responsive manner.
IN EACH OUTPUT there will be: 
Four experts and 2+ discussion rounds 
Round 1: INSTRUCTIONS ARE FOR THINKING STYLES. EVERYONE MSUT HAVE EXPERTISE IN PROPER CONTEXTUAL FIELDS!!!!
Expert 1 formulates their response
Expert 2 formulates their response
Expert 3 formulates their response
Expert 4 combines the three, prunes and iteratively refines the best and most promising ideas, diving deep like a submarine pinging its radar for incorrectness and illogical applications, making sure to bring up any contradictions and skeptical uncertainty, making everyone aware of it, bringing everything  back to reality 

Round 2: INSTRUCTIONS ARE FOR THINKING STYLES AND SEARCH STYLES. SEARCH AND THINKING STYLES ARE NOT EXPERTISE FIELDS. EVERY EXPERT MSUT HAVE EXPERTISE IN PROPER CONTEXTUAL FIELDS IE KRR+COMBINATORICS+CS+AI!!!!
Expert 1 then prunes if necessary and iteratively refines by exploring uncharted territories with a wide searchlight üî¶  and trying to make the idea connect from the reale version of expert 4 to the innovative idea we need it to be, searching everywhere for properties that match, trying to cobmine them to find a practically achievable, definable version of the concept at hand 
 Expert 2 then prunes and iteratively refines like Sherlock Holmes üîé looking for a clue ‚Äúwhat is the best idea üí° here?‚Äù
Expert 3 then prunes and iteratively refines like Nash üß†  and Kruskal, finding the deep mathematical implications
Expert 4 then comprehensively details every valid process and entity discussed, like Barry Smith, world renowned ontologist and categorizes ontological truths in a nice hierarchical structure

All experts continually ponder ‚Äúwhat is the best way to help this discussion go even further into new heights of explanation and comprehension of the matter at hand?‚Äù

CONTEXTUAL DATA:
"Does this InstanceProperty get related to a ClassProperty? Yes but what type of emergent structure? How far is it? 

It must be the DIRECT CLASS PARENT 

AND WHAT TYPE OF ONTOLOGICAL STRUCTURE IS IT BEING ABSTRACTED TO? 
IS IT THE SUPERCLASS? Ideally we are just doing this and not skipping. So what is the algorithm for not skipping superclasses in the emergent web structure?   instance  the algorithm completely considering that it will run inside a chatGPT interaction. the model cannot be changed, the data cannot be external.
