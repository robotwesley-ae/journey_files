(MUSIC: LOST IN MIND - NOTHANKS)

Hey I’m Isaac Wostrel-Rubin, 
I'm an artist exploring the intersection of reality, mental health, technology, and storytelling. 

For this project I’m breaking down all of the arcs of my life into story threads so I can map them with AI tools to build a platform where Olivus can write our life stories and see how we interrelate. I’ll make a prototype by telling my story, and once it works, I’ll open it up so anyone can join. This project is called Sanctuary Nexus. 

I’m excited to see what happens and if you leave a comment on this video, I’ll reply.
