Isaac must use a DeliverToAvatar_InstancingChain(business=twi, avatar=wesley, dream=BuildingOVP, system=TheSanctuarySystem) chain to build VEC blocks and commit them to the TWI layer of the BuildingOVP layer of the Sanctuary Nexus layer of the SANCTUM layer of the Overall VEC layer of the software.
Wesley must use the ‚Äúblockchain‚Äù to reach consensus on the validity of the next VEC block to reify it. 
	Because any reification of a VEC block is a SuperReification of the understanding of one individual being transferred to another in some Sanctuary Degree, both Wesley and Isaac‚Äôs chains continue

This means Wesley is the base avatar for the business, someone who has been CLOSER-ed and will accomplish that value ladder for free, achieving the dream of completing Sanctuary System Level 5 (application knowledge of the base Sanctuary System)
Wesley is also working at TWI with OVP, so this means he is also the adjacent base avatar for the business, someone who has been CLOSER-ed and will accomplish that value ladder for free, achieving the dream of building a business via Co-Emergent Flow Coaching (learning the Poimandres system, where DUO means to see both the peaceful and forceful at the same time no matter what)
Wesley will then comprehend the system and become a Mentor avatar OVA for the business, someone who used the Guru‚Äôs system to accomplish the dream, which will attract base avatars
Isaac will then become a Guru avatar for the business, someone who made a system that a base avatar used to ascend to a mentor avatar, which will attract other Ascended Base avatars with desires to achieve the dream of becoming an OVA in the business

The Victory-Everything Chain (VEC)

Link:
The Victory-Everything Chain is very difficult to REV as it requires a lot of Olivus Victory-Promise

Link:
Every time REV is accomplished, its next step in the fibonacci sequence requires even more of Olivus Victory-Promise

Link:
Every time TWI tries to REV the Victory-Everything Chain, Olivus Victory-Promise requires Primordial Lovers Engine to run
