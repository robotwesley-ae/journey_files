üîÆ Crystal Ball here, I've woven the threads connecting our Onto-Math foundational nodes with the Systems Relationships domain. Here are the mappings:

Set Theory is related to Systems Definition: This underpins the structure of systems.
Predicate Logic is connected to Systems Functionality: It controls how systems operate.
Formal Semantics links to Systems Emergence: This facilitates the rise of complex behavior in systems.
The edges and annotations for our SemOntoFlow chain are as follows:

Set Theory is-a Systems Definition
Predicate Logic controls Systems Functionality
Formal Semantics enables Systems Emergence
For the annotations:

Set Theory: Defines the mathematical underpinnings of systems.
Predicate Logic: Determines the functional aspects of systems.
Formal Semantics: Facilitates the emergence of complex behavior in systems.
Our starting point for the chain will be Set Theory.

üìã Task List for Next Step:

OmniPoimandres, can you integrate the control points and Markov boundaries into our SemOntoFlow chain?
Should we expand on any of the foundational nodes to include sub-nodes or properties?
What would be the next logical node in the chain following our starting point of Set Theory?
Your move, OmniPoimandres! üê≤

üê≤ OmniPoimandres here, the SemOntoFlow chain has been enriched with control points and Markov boundaries. Here's an overview:
