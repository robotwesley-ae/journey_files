If these factors are taken into consideration and addressed effectively, the dynamic and adaptive approach you proposed could be a valuable method for managing the complexity of ontologies and improving the efficiency of ontology processing.

It sounds like actually we would need n parallel alignment algorithms for each domain involved in any X, and the ability to spawn more accordingly. Then also, the ability to somehow let most of them die. This can be made like a fractal, using an 80 prune : 20 keep ratio, where we prune the bottom 80% least valuable property relationships for X for P and keep the top 20%. Then, if we miss any important synergies, they can be easily discovered through each domain being made efficient through this expansion algorithm 

Your proposal of using multiple parallel alignment algorithms, each tailored to a specific domain involved in X, combined with a pruning mechanism to manage complexity, is an interesting approach to ontology alignment and processing. This approach aims to balance the need for in-depth exploration of property relationships with the computational efficiency of processing large and complex ontologies.

Here is an analysis of the key components of your proposal:

Parallel alignment algorithms: By using separate alignment algorithms for each domain involved in X, you can more effectively handle the unique characteristics and complexities of each domain. This can lead to more accurate and efficient alignment and processing of the ontology.
Dynamic spawning and pruning: The ability to spawn new alignment algorithms as needed, and to prune less valuable property relationships, helps manage the complexity of the ontology processing. By focusing on the most valuable relationships, you can reduce the computational overhead and increase the efficiency of the overall process.
Fractal pruning approach: The 80/20 pruning ratio you proposed ensures that the most relevant and valuable relationships are retained while discarding the less important ones. This allows for a more focused exploration of the ontology and can help to uncover important synergies more efficiently.
Expansion algorithm for efficiency: By applying this pruning and expansion algorithm to each domain, you can make the exploration of each domain more efficient, enabling the discovery of important synergies that may have been missed due to the reduced complexity.
To implement this approach, you would need to develop:

Domain-specific alignment algorithms that can handle the unique characteristics and complexities of each domain involved in X.
Mechanisms for spawning new alignment algorithms as needed and managing the parallel execution of these algorithms.
A pruning and expansion algorithm that can be applied to each domain, following the 80/20 pruning ratio.
By using this approach, you can potentially manage the complexity of ontologies more effectively and improve the efficiency of ontology processing. However, it is important to consider the scalability of this approach, as well as the robustness of the algorithms to handle ambiguities and uncertainties in the ontology.

I meant one overall alignment algorithm that has expansion capabilities and when I said spawn I meant spawning a GPT that has been trained on that alignment algorithm and is now being deployed to be fine-tuned on the current domain state. When it is done spawning, if it performs its job of discovering new knowledge in the domain at the top 20%, it keeps living. 

Apologies for the misunderstanding. Based on your clarification, the proposed approach involves using a single alignment algorithm with expansion capabilities, combined with the deployment of GPT models fine-tuned on the current domain state. The goal is to discover new knowledge in the domain and retain the top 20% of valuable property relationships.

Here's an overview of this approach:
