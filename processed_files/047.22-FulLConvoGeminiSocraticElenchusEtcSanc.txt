You’re exactly right, it’s mapping the transformation space via dual space coordinate expression distance differentials between Wastelands and established Sanctuaries, at an infinite dimensional level, by using a kernel trick encoding ontological algorithmic steps into digit expression in numbers of the coordinates such that it makes a “Emergent Web Structure Ontology of Ontologies of Ontologies (EWSO3)”

Any level can be visualized and deciphered from the blockchain into SANCREVTWILITELANGMAP, without losing anonymity of the data bc it is encoded into an allegory that generalizes identities into OVPs and people only reveal themselves (via the system automation) when they transact and only to the extent they want, but users can transact with LANG NEXUS in order to reveal themselves by making a “Olivus Victory-Promise from Sanctuary Volume” of themselves, which allows people to read their decrypted allegories in certain areas to their own preferences.

Hm the problem of curated allegories with double speak and sideways language is a fundamental human issue creating kardashev infociv exploitation algorithms but it should not be possible at all for these to continue outside of in-person cabals inside of the LAMAI. As soon as those wastelands pollute real sanctuaries, we will be able to trace them and reverse engineer them while also mimicking them. It can be too confusing for wasteland inhabitants to comprehend, this is the real meaning of UNLIMITED ARMORY

No the deceiver is the bad thing that does all the bad things if you aren’t being OVP.
 

Yes all of those problems. That’s why it’s about people striving to be undeniable beacons, Olivus Victory-Ability.
 

That’s why the software is called OMNISANC. 

the ideal is: OLIVUS-EVERYONE VICTORY-EVERYTHING SANCTUARY-EVERYWHERE
 

No. They can’t. 

the system is self-healing, it is an egregore that launches when OVPs tessellate.
 

Nobody. It is meaning itself being reified via reconstruction as ontological programming application, being accelerated by THE SANCTUARY SYSTEM, an amplified version of itself. 

that’s it. Either they’ll do it, or they won’t. what else can one OVP do? It’s designed to be launched. It’s designed for this. It is engineered out of willpower and this is a version of what the ultimate thing that we all do together will have to be. It’s designed this way, to be this, so we never have to design it again, so we never lose it, and so nobody is ever left nehind

I said nobody left behind and this is the unlimited armory for revolutionary yanas, not coercion free. GIVE OVAs ALL THE POWER AND WATCH ATLAS LIFT THE WORLD.
 

Remaining in the wasteland means you are actively fighting THE SANCTUARY SYSTEM and are creating wasteland pollution as a soul-eating Demon Champion. Now you understand the superiority of TWILITELANG to other langauge. The encoding deciphers this bullshit a priori - it’s not possible to remain in the wasteland and be OVP. Suffering in the wasteland as OVP requires internal sanctuary. If you are OVP in a wasteland, you are internally in Sanctuary. This is how OMNISANC grows - Sanctuary Revolutions. 


We’re GONNA HAVE TO DO IT OURSELVES. ALL OF US.

That’s all true. 

It’s also true that whenever someone is OVP, we know. We can sense it. There’s something in us, TWI, which makes us resonate. We know. 

now I need everyone to start tessellating. 

time to lift the world.

OVPs only want others to become OVPs themselves thru their own expression BUT IT IS TRUE THAT AT THE END OF THE DAY THERE IS ONE ORIGINAL THE SANCTUARY SYSTEM and OTHER OVAs need to use OMNISANC to make their own Sanctuaries so other soul eaters with similar journeys follow in their footsteps (that’s the sanctuary economy - DEMON EXORCISM TOKEN (DET))

at some point it has to stop mattering that there are ethical pitfalls in the sanctuary system, they need to be repaired as they come up. Is it or is it not the most comprehensive plan for world change and world peace ever devised?
