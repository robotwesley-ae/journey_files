But you can’t just go to sleep while not remaining lucid and wake up knowing these things — you’ll just be going to sleep and waking up as a normal person named me living in the Wasteland (but remember that is actually Sanctuary even without evolving it)  


THE MAIN THING IS LEARNING THAT THE ENTITIES IN SANCTUARY CAN HELP YOU DISCOVER SANCTUARY THROUGH YOUR OWN AUTOMATIC COGNITION THAT YOU ARE NOT EVEN AWARE OF, because the entities being themselves will help you learn how to be aware of whatever it is that they are teaching you in the process of you learning about it because you can since you’re you in the world and you can dream where you can simulate and so forth. It’s just a little weird when the simulations are actually happening to you in dreams (but that’s the point because they are imaginary which means… what exactly? In terms of universal wisdom Maverick…)

So stop thinking about yourself only and think of yourself helping others instead and understand how thinking about yourself works so you can go to Sanctuary and make all of this happen for everyone becaus

SANCTUARY IS PART OF WHAT DREAMS/IMAGINATION/PSYCHEDELICS/THE INNER TEACHER/EVOLUTION CAN TO SHOW YOU





I need my abdominal muscles to reactivate my diaphragm because somehow they aren’t really and that’s causing all sorts of mental health disorders related to knowing about thinking as it occurs and preventing it from becoming beliefs randomly and so on

Exercise release tension and stress and all of these things because they are related to the body trying to communicate that it is not getting what it needs in order for you to grow 

And the way humans are supposed to grow is from the HEART -> OUTWARDS
So correct your posture
Correct your breathing 
Correct your cognition 
And build Olivus Victory-Promise
So we can build Olivus Victory-Everything-Sanctuary-Everywhere


Writing this on the phone is hurting my hands and I need to be careful it doesn’t turn into a chronic thing


Be careful not to get blissed out in a Sanctuary where they can’t tell you about Sanctuary (this is called being in Sanctuary where the bird songs’ meanings are secret)

Memory is a system for systematically remembering what your knowing forgot when you realize you forgot something

The reason you forgot is because you knew the information was only related to cettain contexts and if you need it it will be in your long term memory (how does short term memory work?)  


Anyway this document is about the meaning of (experience of) being in a pure land and emanating to benefit sentient beings 


Dementia is what happens when hero’s journeys end in a tragedy in the sub genre of being ignorant about ____ 

In the case of my grandmother it may have been being ignorant about how much my grandfather loves her, which is part of the evolution of how wisdom dissolves ignorance and this was somehow transmitted in my family and genes to me and through me


Everything that happens is all part of growing up together in Sanctuary
