As an AI language model, I am unable to directly access and process historical market data. However, I can guide you through the process of how to do this using a programming language like Python. With Python, you can use libraries such as pandas, numpy, and yfinance to obtain and process the data. Below is a step-by-step guide:

Install the required libraries:
diff
Copy code
!pip install pandas numpy yfinance
Import the libraries:
python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import yfinance as yf
Define the reporting periods:
python
Copy code
reporting_periods = [
    ('1993-01-01', '1997-12-31'),
    ('1998-01-01', '2002-12-31'),
    ('2003-01-01', '2007-12-31'),
    ('2008-01-01', '2012-12-31'),
    ('2013-01-01', '2017-12-31'),
    ('2018-01-01', '2021-09-30')
]
Obtain the list of S&P 500 constituents. You can either download a list from a financial data provider or use a Python package like pandas-datareader or yfinance. In this example, we'll use a placeholder list called sp500_symbols.
Download the historical price data for each asset:
python
Copy code
def download_price_data(symbols, start_date, end_date):
    data = yf.download(symbols, start=start_date, end=end_date)['Adj Close']
    return data
Calculate the daily growth percentage for each asset:
python
Copy code
def calculate_daily_growth(data):
    daily_growth = data.pct_change()
    return daily_growth
Identify the asset with the highest daily growth percentage for each day:
python
Copy code
def find_top_growth_asset(daily_growth):
    top_growth_asset = daily_growth.idxmax(axis=1)
    return top_growth_asset
Calculate the average daily growth percentage for the top-performing asset in each reporting period:
python
Copy code
for start_date, end_date in reporting_periods:
    data = download_price_data(sp500_symbols, start_date, end_date)
    daily_growth = calculate_daily_growth(data)
    top_growth_asset = find_top_growth_asset(daily_growth)
    average_daily_growth = top_growth_asset.value_counts(normalize=True).mul(100)
    print(f"Average daily growth percentage for the top-performing asset in {start_date} - {end_date}:")
    print(average_daily_growth)
Please note that this code snippet is an example and you may need to adjust it to your specific needs, including obtaining the actual list of S&P 500 constituents and handling missing data or errors in the data download process.

What is this statistic I am looking for technically called? 

The statistic you are looking for is the "average daily growth percentage for the top-performing asset" in each reporting period. This statistic is not a standard financial metric, but it is a custom calculation derived from the daily growth percentage for each asset in the S&P 500 index.

In general terms, you are analyzing the performance of the assets with the highest daily growth percentage within specific time periods (5-year reporting periods in your case). By calculating the average daily growth percentage for these top-performing assets, you aim to understand the general trend of the best-performing stocks in the S&P 500 index during each reporting period.

Why isnâ€™t this a standard metric? It is very useful for crypto analysis 

While the "average daily growth percentage for the top-performing asset" in each reporting period may be useful for some specific analysis, such as identifying strong performers within a certain time frame or in a particular market like cryptocurrencies, it is not a standard financial metric for a few reasons:

Variability: Financial markets are dynamic, and the top-performing assets can change rapidly from one day to the next. The average daily growth percentage for the top-performing asset can be highly variable and may not provide a stable basis for comparison or decision-making.
Risk: The top-performing assets on a daily basis may be associated with a higher level of risk, which may not be suitable for all investors. Standard financial metrics typically consider both return and risk, such as the Sharpe ratio, which evaluates the risk-adjusted performance of an investment.
