MELANIE We can't put him in that situation again.
The tension in the room thickens as they try to find a solution.
MELANIE (suggesting) Maybe we can come up with a compromise. Offer him something else he might like.
KEVIN (hesitant) Like what?
MELANIE (enthusiastic) Maybe a day trip somewhere he's always wanted to go. We can make it a family thing.
KEVIN (agrees) That's a good idea. We'll talk to him about it and see if he's interested.
Melanie tries to ease the tension.
MELANIE (reassuring) We have to make sure he knows we're not saying no just to be mean. We're doing it because we love him and want what's best for him.
KEVIN (firm) Absolutely. His safety and well-being come first.
Melanie watches him, sensing there's more to his response.
FADE OUT.

Kevin's peering at the Rolling Loud website like it's an alien artifact. Melanie saunters in, her expression strained. They share a look that screams "trial separation."
MELANIE (deadpan) So, our thirteen-year-old is off to a hip-hop festival then?
Kevin, defensive, counters.
KEVIN (mock surprise) What? No. That would be absurd.
Melanie's patience is on a thin line.
MELANIE (sarcastic) Really? Just like that Disneyland trip wasn't absurd?
Kevin's had it up to here with the Disneyland mentions.
KEVIN (annoyed) Yes, Melanie. Disneyland happened. I was there. Not the best day for my inbox.
Melanie, not letting it go, is still in full mother-bear mode.
MELANIE (insistent) So, we agree. No hip-hop festivals for wandering boy scouts.
The tension’s palpable as they lock horns.
MELANIE (probing) Unless we find a compromise. Something he’d like but won’t lose him in a crowd.
Kevin, clueless but game.
KEVIN (baffled) What? Take him to a... petting zoo?
Melanie, amused and a little hopeful.
MELANIE (brightening) Or maybe a cool museum, a gaming convention. Make it a family outing.
Kevin, reluctantly on board.
KEVIN (resigned) Guess it's worth a shot. But how do we sell a museum over Lil... whomever?
Melanie, always the peacemaker.
MELANIE (reassuring) We just remind him we're not ogres. We want him safe. And happy.
KEVIN (firm) Exactly. His safety and happiness, in that order.
Melanie, sensing there's more to his words.
FADE OUT.
