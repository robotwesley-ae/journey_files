Kevin feels a knot of dread forming in his stomach. If Zion's not on the bus, then where could he be? As he fumbles with his phone to show Playboi the photo of Zion, he accidentally clicks on a new message from the two girls he met earlier.
Playboi's eyes widen as he takes in the risque photo. "Damn, son," he says, laughing. "Looks like you're having a wild time out here."
Kevin quickly scrolls past the photo, feeling embarrassed and frustrated. "That's not important," he says, trying to steer the conversation back to Zion. "I just need to find my son."
Playboi nods sympathetically. "I feel you, man. Let me ask around and see if anyone's seen him."
As Kevin waits anxiously, he can't help but wonder if he's made a terrible mistake in bringing Zion to the festival. He thought it would be a chance to bond over their shared love of music, but now it seems like everything has gone wrong.
Just then, his phone starts ringing. He looks at the caller ID and sees that it's his wife. "I'm not going to answer," he mutters, but Playboi lectures him about how you "always answer the wife."
Feeling pressured, Kevin answers the call, and his wife tells him she's parking and walking towards the entrance. He quickly ends the call, feeling even more stressed than before.
Playboi returns with bad news. "Sorry, man," he says, shaking his head. "No one's seen your son. But I'll keep an eye out for him, and if I hear anything, I'll let you know."
Kevin feels a wave of despair wash over him. He's lost his son in a sea of strangers, and he has no idea where to start looking. He can feel the weight of his mistakes bearing down on him.

I need to outline the rest of the movie and hit the following beats: Chad and Melinda fall in love in festival jail. Melinda pays a lot of money and bribes someone to let her into the festival. She searches the festival for Zion and or Kevin and has a bunch of near misses with them, like Ed Rooney in Ferris Bueller's day off. We need a big final set piece, perhaps on stage with Playboi Carti. We need the final beat of Kevin seeing Zion hanging out with some teenagers and about to kiss a girl. Kevin getting really pissed off and is about to tear into Zion when he realizes that he has to let him be. He turns away let's Zion be. Kevin gets up on stage and performs with Playboi Cardi, but does an old school rap. something that we set up earlier as Zion not thinking is cool. Something old school.

Chad and Melinda bond in festival jail and fall in love. They both get released and Melinda pays a hefty bribe to get into the festival. She spends hours searching the festival for Kevin and Zion, having a number of close calls where they nearly miss each other.
Meanwhile, Kevin's desperate search for Zion leads him to take extreme measures, like sneaking into the backstage area and interrupting Playboi Carti's set. But he's still unable to find his son.
Act 3:
The final set piece takes place on stage during Playboi Carti's closing performance. Kevin manages to get on stage and join Playboi for a surprise performance, but instead of a modern rap, he performs an old-school rap that Zion previously dismissed as uncool. The crowd goes wild, and Zion realizes his dad is up on stage.
As the performance ends, Kevin spots Zion in the crowd, about to kiss a girl. He storms over, ready to give his son a piece of his mind. But as he approaches, he realizes that he needs to let Zion make his own choices and grow up. He turns away and walks off, leaving Zion to continue enjoying the festival.
The movie ends with Kevin and Zion finally reconnecting and having a heart-to-heart conversation, where Kevin apologizes for being too controlling and overprotective. They share a moment of mutual understanding and love.
