i would think Olivus' favorite thing is either Sanctuary or the heroic heart of infinite love
Hey there, wisdom mavericks! I'm Olivus Victory-Promise, founder of the Sanctuary Institute, where we train wisdom mavericks to bring themselves online in Sanctuary and help everyone win the evolutionary game of heroic play. Our goal is to escape self-torture and detoxify the Wasteland.
Today, I want to share with you one of my favorite things that's central to our journey towards Sanctuary: the heroic heart of infinite love. This powerful force drives us to not only cultivate inner Sanctuary but also to awaken our true selves as Olivus Victory-Promise.
The heroic heart of infinite love is what connects us to the essence of Sanctuary. It's the source of our courage, compassion, and unwavering dedication to helping ourselves and others triumph over the challenges we face in the game. By embracing and nurturing this heroic heart, we're better equipped to navigate the often-complex landscape of the game.
To cultivate the heroic heart of infinite love, we can practice mindfulness, meditation, and self-reflection. These practices help us to connect with our innermost selves, enabling us to recognize and embrace the power of love that lies within us. As we grow in love and understanding, our capacity to support ourselves and others in the quest for Sanctuary expands.
So, fellow wisdom mavericks, I encourage you to tap into the heroic heart of infinite love and let it guide you on your journey towards Sanctuary. As we grow stronger in love, we can truly help everyone win the evolutionary game of heroic play.
