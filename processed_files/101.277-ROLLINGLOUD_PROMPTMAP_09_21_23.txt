EXT. ROLLING LOUD - SECTION B - FESTIVAL GROUNDS - NIGHT Kevin, Chad, and Linda emerge from beneath the stage. KEVIN Is everyone okay? CHAD That was awesome! LINDA Best thing I’ve ever done in my life! They take in the chaotic scene unfolding before them. Thousands of confused and frightened festival-goers roam in the DARKNESS -- shouting and screaming. KEVIN What?? You guys alright? Linda and Chad are clearly really high. Somehow the pain from the bites now feel great. LINDA Never better. CHAD OOOOooooohhhh yeahhhhh. I’m like weirdly turned on. KEVIN What in the...? We need to keep a low profile. Act like we belong here. CHAD Agreed. Best not draw attention to ourselves. LINDA We don't want any more trouble. KEVIN Follow me. Let's blend in. Kevin, Chad, and Linda make their way through the crowd, trying to “blend in” but Chad walks like a pimp and Linda does her own weird-style walk... they duck behind a booth... EXT. FESTIVAL GROUNDS - BEHIND A BOOTH - MOMENTS LATER CHAD That was intense. LINDA We just caused a power outage. CHAD That was just like the time we caused a power outage at Principal Rollins’ retirement ceremony and then we double teamed the girl in the bear mascot. KEVIN That never, ever happened. I never did anything close to that. LINDA I can wear a bear mascot. CHAD You’re not in this memory, Linda, don’t try and insert yourself. SUDDENLY, the power HMMMMFS to life, revealing: A SECURITY GUARD staring right at them...like NOSE TO NOSE! EVERYONE (frightened) AHHHHHHHHHHHH! Linda reacts with a Zohan-like triple face kick to the guard! They run away and see that... THE FERRIS WHEEL Is powered up and starting... The jump into the FERRIS WHEEL pod to escape and... Phew... They’re safe. / rewrite the above, keeping all of the dialogue and content, but check for grammar, spelling and flow
