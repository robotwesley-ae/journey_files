 potential skills/domains. SklWv reprsnts intrndd spectrum of output qualities.
SklWb: SklWv is mappd to SklWb, a ntwrk of skills & their intrreltnshps. SklWb reprsnts the way words combine into meanings.
SklChn: SklWb is trnsfrmd into SklChn, a sequence of skills to trnsfrm in into out. SklChn is influenced by SklWv & influences final out.
FBM: Feedback mechanism for system learning from outputs & adjusting its input interpretation, sklWv mapping, & sklChn transformation. Enhances system's performance over time.
Out: Final result after applying SklChn to the in.

Defining predicates to represent phenomena states:
H(x): x is emergent hallucination. D(x, y): x is domain decay due to improper words in y. P(x, y): x is a PIO program finding proper words for y. L(x, y): x is a non-contradictory system linguistically looping for y. I(x, y, z): x covers all contradictions for y in z. E(x, y): x is an engine of non-contradictory systems concatenated for y. Formalizing relationships between predicates: âˆ€x (H(x) â†’ âˆƒy (D(x, y))): Every emergent hallucination x causes domain decay y by improper words in x. âˆ€x, y (D(x, y) â†’ âˆƒz (P(z, y))): Every domain decay x due to improper words in y has PIO program z finding proper words for y.
