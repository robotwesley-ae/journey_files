Relieved that they've managed to avoid a potentially dangerous situation, Kevin and Zion quickly move away from the chaotic scene. Zion looks up at his dad with disappointment in his eyes, his youthful spirit dampened by the realization that he won't be able to experience the festival. Kevin's heart aches as he sees his son's disappointment, determined to find a way to make things right.
Kevin pulls Zion close, their heads almost touching, and whispers in a hushed tone.
KEVIN We have to lie and say you're sixteen.
Zion's face tenses up, a mix of uncertainty and hesitation evident in his expression. He takes a deep breath, preparing himself for what lies ahead.
ZION But Dad, my birthday is July 18th, 2009. That means I'm only thirteen.
Kevin's brows furrow as he contemplates the situation. He knows they need a plan, even if it involves bending the truth.
KEVIN I know, buddy. Just for today, we're going to practice saying your date of birth as three years earlier. It's our secret, okay?
Zion nods, a determined glint in his eyes, as he repeats the new date of birth under his breath.
ZION (insert new date of birth), got it.
Kevin smiles, acknowledging Zion's commitment.
KEVIN Remember, puff out your chest a little, look confident. And just be yourself, bud.
Zion takes another deep breath, straightens his posture, and mimics the action of puffing out his chest.
ZION I got this, Dad.
They continue their journey through the bustling festival grounds, passing vibrant stages, food stalls, and a sea of excited concert-goers. The atmosphere is electric, the air buzzing with anticipation and the thumping beats of the music. As they approach a different entrance manned by a fresh set of security guards, Kevin prepares himself for the pivotal moment.
Zion steps up to the head security guard, who scrutinizes him with a stern gaze. The guard's eyes narrow, challenging Zion's legitimacy.
HEAD SECURITY GUARD IDs, please.
Zion takes a deep breath, channeling his rehearsed confidence. He meets the guard's gaze with unwavering determination.
ZION I left mine at home, but I'm sixteen. I promise.
The guard's eyes shift to Kevin, seeking confirmation. Kevin, sweating bullets, matches Zion's unwavering confidence, delivering his line with nervousness.
KEVIN Absolutely. He's sixteen.
The guard's gaze lingers on them, skepticism etched on his face. He decides to test their story further.
HEAD SECURITY GUARD Alright, what year were you born?
Zion remains cool and collected, answering without skipping a beat.
ZION (insert new year, sounding confident)
Kevin, on the other hand, is sweating profusely, his nerves getting the best of him. He holds his breath, hoping Zion's response will pass the guard's scrutiny.
The guard narrows his eyes, sensing Kevin's unease. He decides to push further, determined to expose any deception.
HEAD SECURITY GUARD And what month is your birthday?
Zion maintains his composure, answering with certainty.
ZION July.
Kevin's heart pounds in his chest, his anxiety growing with each passing second.
The guard stares at them, contemplating their answers. Just when Kevin thinks their secret is about to be revealed, a commotion breaks out in the distance, catching the attention of the guard.
SECOND SECURITY GUARD Hey, we need backup over there! Let's go!
The head security guard's attention is diverted, his focus shifting from Kevin and Zion to the unfolding chaos. Seizing the opportunity, he waves them through with a dismissive gesture.
HEAD SECURITY GUARD Alright, go on. Enjoy the festival.
Kevin's relief washes over him like a wave, and he can't help but break into a wide grin. He looks at Zion, who returns his smile, their shared triumph evident in their eyes.
KEVIN We did it, buddy. We're in.
As they step into the festival, the pulsating energy and vibrant atmosphere envelop them, igniting a sense of adventure and excitement. They walk hand in hand, ready to immerse themselves in the music, the crowd, and the unforgettable experience
