rewrite this, keeping the content, but eliminate redundancy: As Jeremy tries to make his way through the moshpit, he gets hit by a crowd surfer and falls to the ground. Chad is trying to help him up, but the pushing and shoving of the crowd keep knocking them back down. Suddenly, the whole mosh pit turns on Jeremy and Chad, and they become the targets of everyone's aggression. They start fighting back, knocking people left and right. Chad even gets a few body slams in, and Jeremy's years of playing high school football finally come in handy as he bulldozes his way through the crowd. Jeremy accidentally elbows a teenage girl in the face. She goes down like a sack of potatoes, and they feel absolutely horrible. The crowd turns on them, angry at the two middle-aged men for hurting one of their own. Out of nowhere, Jeremy's pants get ripped off and he's left in his underwear. Chad can't stop laughing at the sight of his old high school buddy being pantsed in the middle of a moshpit. To make matters worse, their clothes get ripped off in the commotion, leaving them nearly naked in the middle of the mosh pit. People start spraying them with silly string and throwing empty beer cans at them. Jeremy and Chad try to cover themselves, but it's too late. They've become a target for the angry mob. Just when they think things can't get any worse, they get lifted into the air by the crowd and start to crowd surf. The middle-aged men scream in terror as they're passed around like beach balls. Eventually, they get dumped back onto the ground, pantless and disoriented. Chad is doubled over in laughter, while Jeremy just looks defeated. They still haven't found Zion, and now they're both half-naked in the middle of a sea of people. As they struggle to get out of the mosh pit, they accidentally knock over a small vendor's cart, spilling drinks and snacks all over the place. The vendor starts shouting and cursing at them, adding to the chaos. Finally, Jeremy and Chad make it out of the mosh pit, bruised, battered, and humiliated. They sit on the ground, trying to catch their breath and assess the damage. They look at each other and burst out laughing, realizing how ridiculous they must look. A group of teenagers walks by, and one of them offers them a joint. Jeremy and Chad look at each other, unsure if they should accept. But in the end, they figure they've already been through so much that a little weed couldn't hurt. As they sit there, passing the joint back and forth, they realize that they still haven't found Zion. But for the first time all night, they're not worried about it. They know that they'll find him eventually, and in the meantime, they're just happy to be alive and in one piece.
