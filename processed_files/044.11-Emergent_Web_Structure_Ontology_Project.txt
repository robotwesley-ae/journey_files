Expert 3: Pragmatic Realist + Top-Down Visionary
Using the visionary's universal themes as a starting point, we can then identify practical narrative elements that support these themes. This combined approach ensures we are targeting tangible narrative devices while still adhering to broader, universal themes.
üåê Superanalyst's holistic knitting analysis:
Our approach needs to balance detail and universality while maintaining practical application. Begin with identifying universal themes and narrative archetypes (Top-Down Visionary), then move to detail mapping of the specific story (Detail-Oriented Architect), and finally distill these into practical narrative elements (Pragmatic Realist). In this way, we achieve a multi-layered, comprehensive, yet pragmatic narrative structure that can be applied to various contexts and characters.
ok but it's not that deep. it isn't necessary to model everything. we just need to know the exact key words for the search and their order. let's use the same method, with new experts, who are experts in cryptography, linguistics, semiotics, ontology, AI, etc. in order to think about this. we really need to be thinking of this as an ORACLE situation, where we have a literal crystal ball that can show us informatihedrons if we define them correctly. Let's think about the informadlib and what that means as a template and how ontol-ultramax-sub-contextualization can be leveraged to accomplish this instantaneously and how we might think about making an index of terms in order to start mapping the oracle search capacity

Expert 1: Cryptography Expert
In cryptography, the key is to transform data in a way that only someone who possesses a specific piece of knowledge can interpret it. For our purpose, we might consider viewing the informadlib as a form of 'cipher' - it's a template that can be filled with a multitude of different 'inputs' to yield different outputs. The trick is determining what those inputs should be. We could look to categorize different aspects of the information we're dealing with (characters, settings, themes, etc.), and assign them unique codes or 'keys'. Then, by ordering these keys in a specific way, we could quickly and accurately search for the precise informadlib we're looking for.
Expert 2: Linguistics Specialist
From a linguistics perspective, understanding the structure and semantics of language is paramount. We could try to define a 'grammar' for our informadlib, where different parts of the template correspond to different parts of a sentence (subject, verb, object, etc.). This could provide a structural foundation for creating more complex and specific queries. Also, by focusing on semantics, we could ensure that the terms we're using in our informadlib are as accurate and meaningful as possible.
Expert 3: Semiotics Scholar
Semiotics studies signs and symbols and their use or interpretation. We could benefit from considering each element of the informadlib as a 'sign' that represents a certain concept or piece of information. The key is understanding how these signs are related and how they can be combined to convey different meanings. This could provide a valuable perspective when trying to develop an index of terms and their relationships.
Expert 4: Ontology Architect
An ontology defines a common vocabulary for researchers who need to share information in a domain. It includes machine-interpretable definitions of basic concepts and the relationships among them. Thus, an ontological approach to the informadlib might involve defining a comprehensive set of terms and relationships that encompass all the information we're interested in. This ontology could then serve as a 'map' for navigating the informadlib and searching for specific information.
