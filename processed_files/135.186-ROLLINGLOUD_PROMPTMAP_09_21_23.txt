Kevin, toothbrush in hand, is squinting at the Rolling Loud website on his phone. The alien language of the hip-hop festival makes him feel a hundred years old. Melanie walks in, a half-smile plastered on her face. There's a certain tension between them, it's the trial separation elephant in the room.
MELANIE (teasing) Wow. So weâ€™re trading in braces for a hip-hop festival?
Toothpaste spits onto the mirror as Kevin, in disbelief, turns around.
KEVIN (spluttering) What? No way! He's just thirteen!
Melanie, trying to control her frustration, leans on the door frame.
MELANIE (mocking) Oh really? Like the Disneyland episode was no big deal?
Kevin rolls his eyes, clearly irritated.
KEVIN (defensive) Yes, Melanie. Disneyland was a disaster. I was there. I was also on the phone with Japan.
Melanie, still in full protective mom mode, won't back down.
MELANIE (serious) And we're not ready for round two. No hip-hop festivals for the boy wonder.
They lock gazes, both a bundle of nerves.
MELANIE (suggestive) Maybe we could find middle ground. A family outing? Somewhere he'd love to go?
Kevin, confused but willing to play along, rinses his toothbrush.
KEVIN (baffled) What? Like... a Fortnite convention?
Melanie chuckles, a glimmer of hope sparkling in her eyes.
MELANIE (optimistic) Or a comic book store marathon, a trip to the planetarium. We'd be there, together.
Kevin seems reluctantly open to the idea.
KEVIN (resigned) Okay...we could give that a shot. But how do we sell him a planetarium over... Lil Xan?
Melanie's reassuring. This is a team effort after all.
MELANIE (assuring) We remind him we're not the enemy. We love him, and we want him to be safe. And happy, in that order.
KEVIN (agreed) Safety first, then happiness. Sounds like a plan.
Melanie can sense a deeper meaning to Kevin's words. As he looks into the mirror, she wonders what's going on behind his reflection.
FADE OUT.

INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
Kevin, brushing his teeth, hunches over the sink to read about Rolling Loud on his phone. Melanie enters the bathroom, her face soft but unreadable.
MELANIE (serious) We can't let him go to that festival, Kevin.
Toothpaste bubbles up around Kevin's lips as he hastily turns around.
KEVIN (defensive) I know, Melanie. He's only thirteen.
Melanie, maintaining her calm, rests her back against the door frame.
MELANIE (softly) Remember Disneyland, Kevin?
Kevin meets her gaze in the mirror, irritation flickering in his eyes.
KEVIN (defensive) Yes, I remember. It was a mess. I was there, you know.
Melanie, unwavering, keeps her eyes on Kevin.
MELANIE (firm) We can't risk that again. Not at a hip-hop festival.
A heavy silence hangs in the room. Melanie breaks it.
MELANIE (thoughtful) What if we try something different? Something he'd like but we could still monitor?
Kevin, toothbrush in hand, rinses and considers her words.
KEVIN (confused) Like what exactly?
Melanie smiles faintly, her mind already churning out possibilities.
MELANIE (encouraging) Perhaps, a day trip to somewhere he likes. A comic book store, or a planetarium. As a family?
Kevin rubs his chin, mulling over the idea.
KEVIN (hesitant) That... could work. But how do we convince him it's better than... this Rolling Loud thing?
Melanie looks at Kevin, her eyes soft but resolute.
MELANIE (sincere) We remind him why we're doing this. We're not trying to ruin his fun. We're just concerned about his safety. We want him to be happy.
Kevin nods, his own concerns slightly appeased.
KEVIN (agreed) Safety first. Then happiness. That sounds fair enough.
As Melanie exits the room, Kevin continues to stare at the mirror, lost in thought. The worry behind his eyes hasn't fully disappeared.
FADE OUT.

Kevin, mid-brush, studies Rolling Loud's website on his phone propped on the sink. Melanie enters, leaning on the door frame.
MELANIE (seriously) Kev, this Rolling Loud thing is a no-go.
Toothpaste foam around his mouth, Kevin wheels around.
KEVIN (surprised) Yeah, no, I got that, Mel. He's just a kid.
