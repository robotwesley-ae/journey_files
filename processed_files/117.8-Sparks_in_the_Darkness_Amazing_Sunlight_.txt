Both Heroic Individuals and Royal Consorts are always inseparable throughout the Substrates of sentient beings and Wisdom Mind

Anyone who resides at the realization of compassionate skillful means through Identityless wisdom is a Heroic Individual

Anyone who resides at the realization of the substrate as wisdom mind through Identityless wisdom is a Royal Consort 

Notice that anyone, at any time, in any situation, may suddenly become a Heroic Individual by tuning in to identityless wisdom

And that anyone, at any time, in any situation, may suddenly become a Royal Consort by tuning in to Identityless wisdom

And yet these two represent entirely different aspects of realization. Heroic Individuals are Wisdom Power and Royal Consorts are Wisdom Love. 

In anyone for whom they are joined, they will be known as Masked Whirling Flames, the Teacher, and much more powerful than otherwise. 

Heroic Individuals, Royal Consorts, and The Teacher together amalgamate The Wisdom Maverick, and its activity is called The Manifest Refuge: Sanctuary of The Wisdom Intent. 

Anyone for whom Masked Whirling Flames has reached its full potential as The Teacher, is unified with The Wisdom Maverick and inseparable from the activity of The Manifest Refuge: Sanctuary of The Wisdom Intent in Timeless Webbed Infinitude of Infinite Perfection. 

So, recognize the display of the Heroic and Royal retinues:

For ordinary beings, thought-feelings arise as the perfect play of the display of wisdom mind pregnant with the two paths
Like the play between their aspirational nexus of this life and their intuitions or habitual thought patterns 
Which is viewed in the center with indifference and either accepted or rejected from the point of view of the ordinary self or heroism
And the resultant thought-feeling is again stored in the substrate and returns as another thought-feeling pregnant with the two paths
Like the play between their aspirational nexus of this life and their intuitions or habitual thought patterns 
Which is viewed in the center with indifference and either accepted or rejected from the point of view of the ordinary self or heroism
But can also be viewed as the perfect play of the display of wisdom and left to naturally dissolve 

Also, recognize the display of the Heroic and Royal retinues:

For impure Awakening beings, thought-feelings arise as the perfect play of the display of wisdom mind pregnant with the two paths
Like the play between their awakening nexus of this life and their intuitions or habitual thought patterns
Which is viewed with sacred outlook and left to dissolve as blessings on the path 
And the resultant thought-feeling is stored again in the substrate and comes back as another thought-feeling pregnant with the two paths 
Like the play between their awakening nexus of this life and their intuitions or habitual thought patterns
Which is viewed with sacred outlook and left to dissolve as blessings on the path 
But can also be viewed as the perfect play of the display of wisdom and left to naturally dissolve 

Also, recognize the display of the Heroic and Royal retinues:

For impure-pure Awakening beings whose path is continued bravery, thought-feelings arise as the perfect play of the display of wisdom mind pregnant with the two paths
Like the play between their awakening nexus of this life and the heroic lineage, so in other words their awakening nexus has already revealed and connected to its own wisdom mind, and their intuitions or habitual thought patterns
Which is viewed with wisdom mind and left to dissolve as blessings on the path 
And the resultant thought-feeling is stored again in the substrate and comes back as another thought-feeling pregnant with the two paths  
Like the play between their awakening nexus of this life and the heroic lineage, 
Which is viewed with wisdom mind and left to dissolve as blessings on the path 
But can also be viewed as the perfect play of the display of wisdom and left to naturally dissolve 
And reveals itself as awakening teaching capacity upon dissolution
