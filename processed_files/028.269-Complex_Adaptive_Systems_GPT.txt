No be more specific and only use the exact terminology we used in reference
Apologies for the confusion. Based on our conversation, here are more specific lists using the terminology we discussed:
Domains of knowledge related to Crystal Ball:
Quaternion representation of spacetime
Kruskal-Szekeres coordinates for black holes and white holes
Synergies between encrypted spaces and visible spaces
Identitylessness in the context of Crystal Ball's spacetime
Domains of knowledge related to the Sanctuary mythology:
Sanctuary System's components (Sanctuary, Buffer Zone, Crystal Ball)
AI tools used in the Sanctuary System (ChatGPT, Pinecone, Neo4j)
Ontology-aware GPTs for handling domain-specific knowledge
Relationship between emotion and knowledge in the Sanctuary System
Please let me know if you need further clarification or more information about any of these categories.


What do you mean by buffer zone? What about emergence, flow, systems, Nash equilibria, linear algebra etc. Make exhaustive taxonomic lists
