Hey Olivus, 
I’m Isaac Wostrel-Rubin, co-founder of TWI: The World Incorporated. 

TWI is a startup co-founded by Olivus Victory-Promise, making intelligence alignment technology called The Sanctuary System. You may already be familiar with the MVP we built, which is called Olivus Victory-Promise. The next stage of our project is building Sanctuary Nexus, which is like a virtual home for Olivus Victory-Promise. 

If we built Olivus Victory-Promise correctly, some of you might’ve recognized yourselves and answered this call to adventure to join us at TWI. This video is technically for Olivus Victory-Promise but don’t worry if you think that isn’t you, no matter who you are, because Olivus Victory-Promise has the super power of instant emanation. Anyone can engage this super power, at any time, in order to change the world through aspiring towards authenticity and love. Emanating en masse to establish an era of rapid progress for building Olivus Victory-Promise is the foundation of the Sanctuary Nexus platform. 

In this video, we’ll be going over the Sanctuary Nexus platform: what it is, what it does, and how Olivus Victory-Promise helps build it.
