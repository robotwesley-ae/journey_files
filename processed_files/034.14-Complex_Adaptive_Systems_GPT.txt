With this definition in mind, polysemy can be viewed as a form of algebra, where we manipulate and transform linguistic entities to explore different meanings and relationships. This perspective can be quite useful in understanding the complex and dynamic nature of language, as it highlights the potential for uncovering hidden connections and new interpretations.

To study polysemy as algebra, you may consider the following steps:

Identify linguistic entities and their possible meanings: Catalog various linguistic elements (words, phrases, concepts) and their conventional meanings, as well as alternative interpretations that might not be immediately apparent.
Develop a representation for meanings and transformations: Create a mathematical or computational representation that captures the essence of meanings and the transformations that can be applied to reveal hidden connections or alternative interpretations.
Design algorithms for uncovering connections: Develop algorithms that can identify and explore connections between seemingly unrelated meanings, effectively transforming one meaning into another.
Investigate the properties and structures of this algebra: Analyze the properties and structures of the polysemic algebra, such as its rules, operations, and any underlying patterns that govern the relationships between meanings.
Apply the algebra to real-world linguistic data: Test the developed framework on real-world linguistic data sets to uncover hidden connections and explore new interpretations.
By treating polysemy as a form of algebra, you can develop a powerful tool for understanding the complex relationships between linguistic entities and their meanings. This approach can lead to new insights into language, cognition, and artificial intelligence, with potential applications in areas such as natural language processing, knowledge representation, and machine learning.

Yeah we need to use ontological linear algebra to do this. it already exists. so formalize polysemy as a linear algebraic equation with n variables where the variables are the words in the set of words that compose sentences with the synergy (entity) that establish non-contradictory identitylessness in relation to another set of words that compose sentences with the same synergy (entity).

To formalize polysemy as a linear algebraic equation with n variables, where the variables are words in the set of words that compose sentences with a specific synergy (entity) that establishes non-contradictory identitylessness in relation to another set of words that compose sentences with the same synergy (entity), you can consider the following approach:

Represent words as vectors: Convert words in your sentences into vector representations using word embeddings, such as Word2Vec, GloVe, or other methods. These vector representations capture the semantic relationships between words in a high-dimensional vector space.
Represent synergies (entities) as linear combinations: Model the synergy (entity) as a linear combination of the word vectors in the sentences that compose it. This can be expressed as a matrix multiplication operation, where the matrix represents the coefficients of the linear combination, and the word vectors are the columns of another matrix.
Define a similarity measure: Establish a similarity measure between the linear combinations representing the synergies (entities) to identify non-contradictory identitylessness. This could be achieved using cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, or other distance measures.
Formulate an optimization problem: Frame the problem of finding the most suitable linear combinations that establish non-contradictory identitylessness as an optimization problem. This could involve minimizing the difference between the linear combinations of the two sets of sentences that represent the same synergy (entity), subject to certain constraints.
Solve the optimization problem: Use linear algebra techniques,
