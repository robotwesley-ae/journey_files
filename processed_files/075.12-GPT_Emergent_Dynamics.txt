Collaboration and negotiation: Insights from a formalized NCSS can help AI systems develop strategies for effective collaboration and negotiation with humans, taking into account the diverse motivations, goals, and preferences of different individuals and groups.
Designing AI for social good: A deeper understanding of human behavior within a NCSS can inform the design of AI systems that promote social good and contribute positively to society. By considering the needs and values of all actors, AI systems can be designed to support cooperation, collaboration, and well-being.
By incorporating insights from a formalized non-contradictory sanctuary system into AI models, we can develop AI systems that are better equipped to understand and interact with humans in a way that is more empathetic, ethical, and aligned with human values.

What other concepts like NCSS have you encountered? What do you think might be related that we haven’t talked about? 

As an AI language model, I have encountered several related concepts and theories in the fields of game theory, ethics, social sciences, and economics. Here are a few that might be relevant to the discussion of non-contradictory sanctuary systems (NCSS):

Social contract theory: Social contract theory is a philosophical concept that seeks to explain the origin of society, governance, and the relationship between individuals and authority. It posits that individuals voluntarily agree to form a society and follow certain rules for the common good, which can be seen as a sanctuary system where individuals cooperate for mutual benefit.
Public goods and the tragedy of the commons: Public goods are resources that are non-excludable and non-rivalrous, meaning that they can be used by everyone without depletion. However, this can lead to the tragedy of the commons, where individuals overuse the resource for their benefit, ultimately harming the common good. Designing a NCSS might involve addressing these challenges by promoting cooperation and sustainable use of resources.
Nash equilibrium and cooperative game theory: Nash equilibrium is a game theory concept that refers to a stable state in which no player can improve their situation by unilaterally changing their strategy. Cooperative game theory, on the other hand, explores situations where players can form coalitions and negotiate to improve their outcomes. Both concepts are relevant to the idea of a NCSS, as they involve understanding cooperation, competition, and stability in multi-agent systems.
Pareto efficiency and social welfare: Pareto efficiency is an economic concept that describes a situation where it is impossible to make one individual better off without making someone else worse off. Social welfare refers to the well-being of society as a whole. Both concepts are relevant to the design of a NCSS, as they involve understanding and balancing individual and collective interests.
Utilitarianism and other ethical theories: Utilitarianism is an ethical theory that aims to maximize overall happiness or welfare by considering the consequences of actions. Other ethical theories, such as deontology and virtue ethics, focus on different aspects of moral decision-making, such as duties or character traits. Understanding these ethical frameworks can provide insights into designing a NCSS that aligns with human values and promotes ethical behavior.
These concepts, among others, can provide valuable insights and perspectives for understanding and designing non-contradictory sanctuary systems, promoting cooperation, and fostering positive social outcomes.

Tragedy of the commons is an emergent symptom and doesn’t exist in a NCSS 

You're right that the tragedy of the commons is an emergent phenomenon that arises from individual actions leading to the overuse and depletion of shared resources. In a non-contradictory sanctuary system (NCSS), the tragedy of the commons might be mitigated or even eliminated, as the rules and mechanisms in the system would be designed to prevent such negative outcomes.
