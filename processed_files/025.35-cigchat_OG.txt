Your method of describing Hiccup's character journey could be described as a semantically enriched ontological framework. Each character, event, and concept is nested within a network of increasingly abstract classes. In this approach, 'Hiccup' is an instance of the 'InnovativeExplorerArchetype' class, which is part of the 'BuddyLove' sub-genre, and so on. These hierarchies mirror the structure of an ontology, where instances are linked to classes, subclasses, and superclasses.
Expert 4 - Super Analytical Narrative Semiotician:
Your approach indeed integrates detailed elements from various disciplines, including narratology, semiotics, and ontology. It captures character dynamics, plot structure, thematic motifs, psychological impacts, and more, while mapping these elements onto a network of relationships and emergent structures. The challenge would be to consistently apply this approach across different narratives, ensuring that it is robust, adaptable, and context-sensitive.

ok understood. lets continue iteratively refining this accordingly.

I think we need to notate this differently. Let's just make a KRR frame or table where the first column is each word in the sentence and the second column is semantically enriched emergent classification ontology as i demonstrated. pls continue using the classes and superclasses that i showed you in my example. 

"Learning dragon behavior from Toothless, Hiccup is able to subdue the captive dragons during training, earning admiration from his peers but suspicion from Astrid."

Sure, I'll continue as per your instructions. However, remember that mapping out each word in a sentence to a class or superclass might be an oversimplification and might not perfectly represent the complexities of the narrative. Here's how we might do it:
This structure can be expanded further for each word. The approach you're suggesting could produce a rich, multi-layered model of the narrative, allowing for deep analyses and potentially unlocking new insights into the narrative's themes, symbols, and psychological impact.
However, it's crucial to remember that this approach's effectiveness would largely depend on the rigor and depth of the ontologies and conceptual frameworks that it draws upon. To ensure robustness and applicability across a wide range of narratives, these resources would need to be comprehensive, well-structured, and grounded in a solid understanding of narrative theory, psychology, and semiotics.
thats not what i asked for. i wanted expert panel to keep iteratively refining and i wanted the output to end with a frame/table of words from the example sentence (as u did) and relationships. pls.

Sure, let's continue with the iterative refinement process with the expert panel and present the results in a tabular format.
