EXT. SECURITY TENT - ROLLING LOUD VENUE - NIGHT
Kevin rushes up to the receptionist, sweat dripping. KEVIN (out of breath) Excuse me, ma'am! I need your help. My son is missing.
The receptionist, a young woman with a calm demeanor, listens attentively as she begins taking down the report. RECEPTIONIST (concerned) Okay, sir. Please calm down.
KEVIN We were at the festival, and I turned around for just a moment, and he's gone. I've been searching everywhere, but I can't find him.
The receptionist's fingers fly over the keyboard as she starts documenting the information. RECEPTIONIST What's your son's name?
KEVIN (panicked) His name is Zion. He's thirteen.
RECEPTIONIST (eyes him sternly) You need to be sixteen.
KEVIN I know, but...
SECURITY GUARD 1 Hey, you told me your son was sixteen.
KEVIN Um...he is. He is sixteen.
SECURITY GUARD 2 (angry) Hold on a minute! I distinctly remember you telling me your son was 13 earlier.
RECEPTIONIST What’s going on here, sir?
KEVIN (admitting) You're right. My son is actually 13. I... I lied. I'm sorry.
SECURITY GUARD 1 (disapproving) You knowingly provided false information, putting your child at risk. That's a violation of Section 273a of the Penal Code. Do you realize the consequences?
SECURITY GUARD 2 (threateningly) I should call child protective services on you right now!
KEVIN (losing defensive) I didn't realize there was an age restriction.
SECURITY GUARD 1 Calm down, sir.
KEVIN I’m calm. I just wanted to bond with my son, I never meant to put him in danger.
Suddenly, a burst of energy erupts at the entrance of the security tent. The sound of hurried footsteps fills the air, grabbing everyone's attention.
CHAD (voice filled with determination) Step back! Nobody's cuffing my buddy Kevin!
SECURITY GUARD 1 (caught off guard) Who the hell are you?
CHAD (standing tall) I'm Chad, Kevin's friend. And I won't let you take him away.
SECURITY GUARD 2 (angry) This is none of your business! Step aside!
CHAD (firmly) It is my business when my friend is in trouble. Back off!
