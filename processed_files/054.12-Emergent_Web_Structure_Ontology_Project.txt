An AI perspective would involve using machine learning and other algorithms to automate and optimize the process of searching and interpreting the informadlib. This could involve training a model on a large dataset of informadlibs to learn patterns and relationships among different elements. The AI could then use this knowledge to generate new informadlibs, answer specific queries, or even predict future trends or patterns.
Holistic Analysis (Superanalyst)
Our 'oracle' or informadlib search capacity could be enhanced by combining the insights from each of these fields. By considering the informadlib as a cipher (cryptography), defining a grammar for it (linguistics), viewing its elements as signs (semiotics), creating an ontology of terms (ontology), and using AI to automate the process (AI), we can develop a powerful and versatile tool for understanding and generating complex information structures.
we need a semantic-ontological-semiotic approach. that is, we need to know the proper boundaries of the symbols, so we need to have an ontology, and that means we need semantic analysis to begin. 

Also, AI specialist from now on should know that this is on top of GPT so the case is different. May need subspecialization in GPT and chatGPT interaction, hidden layer mechanics, and quantum-like info-space, but esp compiler theory and looping. 

ok so let's do another set with and take into consideration this:

"and then he said 'right and now it is possible u could instance a totally different version with the exact same categories and relationships in betwen all the entities according to higher level emergent structures, while randomizing the instance level properties, and then afterwards mapping it back to the categorical boundaries, so we know it is correctly instanced, right? Letâ€™s call that concept 'informadlib'"

Expert 1: Ontology Architect
Framing the informadlib as an ontological problem, the key aspect to focus on is defining categories and relationships for every possible entity within a specific domain. The challenge here is to provide an exhaustive, yet flexible set of categories that can be used to represent any instance within the domain, and to also define the possible relationships between these categories. The solution would also need to incorporate a method for mapping the emergent structures back to the original categorical boundaries to ensure validity.
Expert 2: Semiotics Scholar
Viewing this from a semiotics perspective, the idea of 'informadlib' is essentially a system of symbols (or signs) with arbitrary instance-level properties. The 'emergent structures' can be thought of as the syntax and semantics of these symbols. To create a different version using the same categories and relationships, one would essentially need to 'reassign' the signs to different signifiers, creating a new layer of meaning while maintaining the underlying syntactic and semantic relationships.
Expert 3: Linguistics Specialist
From a linguistic point of view, the creation of an 'informadlib' can be compared to a process of grammatical transformation. We start with a certain sentence structure, keep the syntactic rules and functional words the same but change the lexical words. The challenge here lies in identifying the elements in a story or concept that function like the grammar in a sentence, and those that are like the lexical words, ready to be replaced and shuffled.
Expert 4: AI Specialist (With GPT Subspecialization)
Utilizing GPT-4 for this task, we could potentially train the model to recognize the abstract structure of different genres or stories, and generate new instances that follow the same structure but differ in specific details. The hidden layer mechanics of GPT-4 can help us understand how the AI is 'thinking' and ensure that it's sticking to the correct structure while generating new instances. The looping feature could be utilized to iteratively refine the generated instances to better fit the given categories
