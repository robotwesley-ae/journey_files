Playboi Carti introduces Kevin to DON, the head of security. Don is a grizzled veteran who's seen it all.

PLAYBOI CARTI
(to Don)
Don, this is Kevin. He's in a bit of a bind.

Kevin explains the situation to Don, who listens with a mixture of sympathy and amusement. He agrees to help, and with a few keystrokes, he releases Chad and Linda from festival jail.

DON
(grinning)
Your friends are free. Now, let's see if we can find your kid.

INT. SECURITY CONTROL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Kevin, Chad, Linda, and Shenseea crowd into the control room, their eyes darting over the multitude of screens showing different areas of the festival grounds. Their search for Zion begins.

rewrite, but Playboi Carti should say something about how Kevin's earned his respect and how Playboi Carti wishes that he had a father like Kevin. Kevin explains his predicament with security and what happened earlier and Playboi Carti calls his BURLY BODYGUARD and tells the Burly Bodyguard to help Kevin.

Carti, did I just hear you mention you're pals with the festival's head of security?

Yeah, man, me and Big Don are tight. 

KEVIN

I need a favor, Carti. I got friends locked up in festival jail and my son, he's...he's missing.

Playboi Carti regards Kevin, his eyes softening.

PLAYBOI CARTI
(thoughtful)
You know, Kev... I respect that. The lengths you're going for your kid. Makes me wish I had a father like you.

Kevin is taken aback, moved by Carti's words.

KEVIN
(grateful)
Thanks, Carti. I appreciate that.

Playboi Carti turns to his BURLY BODYGUARD, gesturing him over.

Yo, get Don over here. My man Kevin needs a hand with some security issues.

Alright. Your buddies are free. Let's find your son.
