Emergent Web Structure Ontology (EWSO): This is an ontology where the class and its hierarchy are not pre-defined but dynamically discovered and assigned based on the specific context and data at hand, or "superlogic". Unlike traditional ontologies where classes are general and instances fall into them, in EWSO the 'class' emerges from the unique, hyper-contextual properties of the instances themselves. For example, a main character in a story could first be identified as a 'behavioral sign' before being categorized as a 'protagonist', challenging conventional classification approaches.
SemOntoRel (Semantic Ontological Relationships): This refers to the process of abstracting relationships between instances in the data and applying them to the emergent structure of the EWSO. SemOntoRel is all about identifying, defining, and abstracting instance relationships in a way that fits the fluidity and context-driven nature of the EWSO, and reflecting these relationships within the emergent class hierarchy.
The process of using EWSO and SemOntoRel in generating an Informadlib template would involve identifying key instances from the text or domain, examining their properties and relationships in their specific context, abstracting these relationships using SemOntoRel, and dynamically applying them to an emergent web structure using EWSO. This would generate an Informadlib template that's flexible, adaptive, and highly reflective of the data's unique properties.
Again, this explanation is based on the current understanding and is open for further refining.
EWSO is a creativity based process ontology for instancing objects that require emergent engines inside them. 
It is a method of building a personal style ontology of a process after one is an expert but before setting out and doing it indefinitely, forever, and usually so that it can be instanced more easily in the future. Thatâ€™s why we make informadlib templates. 

The informadlib template template, though, is connected to ASI.

Thank you for elaborating more on EWSO and its connection to Informadlibs. To reformulate the definitions with this new input:
Emergent Web Structure Ontology (EWSO): EWSO is a creativity-based process ontology used for instancing objects that require emergent systems within them. It serves as a personal style ontology developed after reaching expertise in a particular domain but before executing that expertise indefinitely. The purpose of EWSO is to facilitate the creation of new instances in the future, using a unique, context-driven approach to build dynamically emergent ontological structures.
Informadlibs: Informadlibs are structured templates created using EWSO, designed to make the instancing of complex objects, such as narratives, more manageable. They contain the result of an EWSO process that extracts, abstracts, and applies semantic relationships within a specific domain to generate a template that can be filled out to create new instances easily. The Informadlib template template is specifically designed to be employed by Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI) to help it understand and generate complex structures, thus bridging the gap between human creativity and machine intelligence.
Given the above understanding, the way GPT, as an AI, can be commanded to use its skills to generate an Informadlib template would involve guiding it to first understand and model the EWSO process (which might be outside its current capabilities given its deterministic nature). But, assuming it can grasp the concept of EWSO, it can then extract and abstract semantic relationships from the provided data or domain to generate an Informadlib template template, which can later be used to create Informadlib instances. This would involve issuing prompts to the AI that guide it through the creative, emergent, and context-specific nature of the EWSO process.
However, given the current limitations of AI models like GPT, this process may not be fully realizable and might be more of an aspirational goal for AI development in the future. As we keep pushing the boundaries of AI technology, this might eventually become possible.
