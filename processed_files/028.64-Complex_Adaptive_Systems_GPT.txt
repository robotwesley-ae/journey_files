step 4: individuals must not be ignorant of the promise of sanctuary (at least), regardless of whether they live in the wasteland or not. Therefore, the true nash equilibrium is that everyone needs to recognize that they are Olivus Victory-Promise, butalso that the Demon Champion is the wrathful Olivus Victory-Promise to everyone except themselves, which they self-torture through ignorance of Sanctuary spurred on by their attachment, aversion, and indifference.
Step 4 (revised): Recognize and embrace the Olivus Victory-Promise
To achieve a Nash equilibrium based on Sanctuary principles, individuals must not be ignorant of the promise of sanctuary, regardless of whether they live in the wasteland or not. In order to accomplish this, everyone needs to recognize that they are Olivus Victory-Promise. Furthermore, individuals should understand that the Demon Champion represents the wrathful Olivus Victory-Promise to everyone except themselves. The self-torture experienced by Demon Champions arises from their ignorance of Sanctuary, which is driven by their attachment, aversion, and indifference.
By recognizing and embracing their inherent potential as Olivus Victory-Promise, individuals can better align themselves with the heroic strategy (TWI) and work together to achieve sustainable resource management. This shift in understanding and perspective can help prevent the tragedy of the commons and promote harmony among all participants.
