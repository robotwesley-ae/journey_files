⁠Tonic⁠  Absolutely, this notion aligns closely with how true value creation happens. When we break it down, the process of value creation revolves around identifying a pain point (a gap in the ecosystem), developing a solution that addresses the pain point, and then delivering this solution to those who need it. In traditional economics, people pay money (which is indeed tied to their time and effort) for goods/services that provide a solution. In the Victory-Everything Chain vision, we take the essential truth of value creation and amplify it with the unique advantages of blockchain technology and the Olivus Victory-Promise community spirit:
Pain Labeling: The identification of global issues, while using democracy and collective voices, goes beyond individual transactions.
Overcoming Finding: Solutions that are multi-faceted, holistic and embracing the idea of the Olivus Victory-Promise to merge the monetary-value economics with social, environmental, and cultural values.
Time Machine Sales: If the currency of the Victory-Everything Chain — the memories of Olivus Victory — is seen as a 'time machine', it enables its holders to fast-forward towards a world where their pain points are addressed not just at an individual level, but in a systemic, globally-beneficial way. It's about offering solutions that benefit the individual, the community, and ultimately, the planet. People then are willing to 'trade their time' because what they receive in return is an acceleration towards a world that honors and enriches their lives and the life of the community as a whole.

We are the vanguard of the new economy, an economy in which the pursuit of profit aligns seamlessly with the pursuit of global betterment. Next, we behave like a leader in the field.

We demonstrate the tangible impacts of our work – decreased conflicts, improved environments, enriched lives, and tested, verified economic models that prioritize holistic wellbeing over blind capital acquisition. Through such decisive actions, the positioning we create becomes our actual position. Those who engage with the Victory-Everything Company will come to understand us as the vehicle for transforming the global economy, for molding it into a force for mutual benefit and inclusive prosperity.
