EXT. ROLLING LOUD ENTRANCE - DAY
Without hesitation, Kevin drops to his hands and knees and starts to crawl under the fence, determination in his eyes. Zion watches nervously, his heart pounding in his chest. But before Kevin can fully commit to his bold plan, a group of SECURITY GUARDS emerges from the surrounding crowd, their presence commanding and their intentions clear.
The security guards move with swift and calculated precision, surrounding the group of teenagers who had successfully snuck in. They brandish batons and tasers, ready to take control of the situation. The air crackles with tension as the guards close in on their targets, their authoritative voices cutting through the chaos.
SECURITY GUARD 1 (on edge) Get down on the ground! Now!
The teenagers, caught off guard and overwhelmed by the sudden onslaught of security, panic and scramble to comply with the orders. The sound of batons swinging through the air echoes, as the guards use forceful strikes to subdue the disobedient ones. Electricity crackles as tasers are deployed, sending jolts of pain through the bodies of those who resist.
Kevin, halfway under the fence, freezes in horror, realizing the danger he's inadvertently put himself in. His eyes widen with fear as he watches the scene unfold before him. In a desperate attempt to save himself from the impending danger, he seizes the moment, using the chaos to his advantage.
KEVIN (yelling at the teenagers) Hey, you kids! You can't sneak in like that! It's not right!
The security guards, momentarily confused by the sudden outburst, turn their attention to Kevin. They shift their focus from the beaten teenagers to this new disruption, assessing the situation with suspicious glares.
SECURITY GUARD 2 (angry) What's your problem, sir?
Kevin, maintaining his act, gestures forcefully towards the group of teenagers, his voice filled with righteous indignation.
KEVIN (intense) I saw them trying to break in! It's my duty to stop them!
The security guards, their instincts sharpened by years of dealing with rule breakers, begin to see Kevin as an ally rather than a threat. They exchange brief nods of acknowledgment, grateful for his intervention.
SECURITY GUARD 1 (serious) Good looking out. We'll take it from here.
The guards refocus their attention on the subdued teenagers, their batons and tasers at the ready. They regain control of the situation, ensuring that order is restored. Kevin, his heart pounding in his chest, takes a deep breath, relieved that his impromptu performance has worked.
He turns to Zion, who stands nearby, wide-eyed and speechless. They exchange a brief but profound glance, silently acknowledging the danger they narrowly avoided. Without uttering a word, they wordlessly agree to retreat from the chaos that surrounds them.
Kevin and Zion slowly back away from the commotion, their hearts still racing with the intensity of the moment. They retreat to a safer distance, leaving the tumultuous scene behind them.
FADE OUT.
