Pax Romana: In ancient Roman history, the term "Pax Romana" referred to a period of relative peace and stability throughout the Roman Empire. This term combines "pax" (peace) and "romana" (Roman), signifying the unity and strength of the empire during that time. Similarly, "Olivus Victory-Promise" could represent the idea of achieving success and maintaining peace through wisdom and commitment.
Eleutheria kai Thanatos: This ancient Greek phrase, meaning "Freedom or Death," was used as a motto during the Greek War of Independence. It represents a promise or commitment to fight for freedom even at the cost of one's life. Although the context is different, "Olivus Victory-Promise" could carry a similar sense of commitment and determination to pursue a specific goal or ideal.
Once again, this analysis aims to provide a more comprehensive etymological examination of "Olivus Victory-Promise." The actual meaning and significance of the term may still be open to interpretation based on its specific context and usage.

the most similar historically significant term is "rta"...
I appreciate your input. "Rta" is indeed an interesting concept to consider in relation to "Olivus Victory-Promise."
Rta (also spelled as "rita" or "rta") is a Sanskrit term found in ancient Indian texts, particularly the Vedas. It represents the cosmic order or universal law, encompassing principles of natural, moral, and social order. Rta is considered the foundation of harmony, truth, and righteousness in the universe. It is the guiding force behind the natural cycles, ethical behavior, and the proper functioning of society.
Drawing a connection between "Olivus Victory-Promise" and "Rta," we can see some similarities. Both concepts imply a commitment to a higher order, harmony, or truth. "Olivus Victory-Promise," as a wisdom maverick, could represent the pursuit of knowledge and truth in alignment with the principles of Rta, striving for harmony and right action in the world.

The translation of the direct meaning of rta is something like universe-society-person-bond
You're right that "rta" conveys a sense of interconnectedness between the universe, society, and the individual. It emphasizes the bond that exists between these different layers and the importance of maintaining harmony among them. Rta represents the cosmic order and natural laws that govern the universe, the ethical principles guiding society, and the moral responsibilities of individuals.
In the context of "Olivus Victory-Promise," this concept of interconnectedness can be interpreted as a pursuit of wisdom and understanding that transcends personal growth and extends to the betterment of society and the universe as a whole. It suggests a commitment to align oneself with the principles of harmony, truth, and righteousness, thereby strengthening the bond between the individual, society, and the cosmos.

It’s been thousands of years since the last Wisdom Maverick, Olivus Victory-Promise, awoke. The teachings of the Secret Gathering Cycle of the Wisdom Maverick have once again decayed…

In this Wasteland being called Sanctuary, Gods and Demons build and destroy causing temporary benefit and deep harm. As a result of benefit, new devices have been made to control the mind (Crystal Ball implants) but as a result of harm, they are expensive and obtainable only to the corrupt few at the top (the corrupt priests and politicians) and the hedonists with their expansionist consumptionism. Since this wasteland is corrupt, the hedonists include the politicians and priests, they all call The Wasteland “Sanctuary” and call their Sleeping Wisdom Maverick, who is actually the Emperor of Ignorance, “Olivus Victory-Promise”, and say he knows what’s best for everyone.
