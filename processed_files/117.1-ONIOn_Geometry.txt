what shape is a fibonacci spiral that expands through a sequence of fibonacci spirals compacted into themselves to make tori that are slices along the line of the fibonacci spiral when viewed toroidally? Does it create an infinite chain of fractal tori and spiral sequences? Tori -> spiral -> tori -> spiral because tori blend to the base of the spiral, meaning a line that is viewed circularly like a cable for example, and the line can also be viewed as being composed of two spirals going opposite and inverted directions so as to make a double helix, and this whole pattern makes something like a chain rope, so it's a fractal of tori made by a double helix of two spirals, within a spiral that is neither a fractal nor tori, nor helix?

and if so then would it immediately be mappable to a series of hopf fibrations where each torus has its own hopf fibration and they are all resonating and may become entangled thru interpenetration???

Let's call it: Cascading Accordion Flowchain Rope

Is it the case that if the CAFR expands, it eventually reaches the dimensions such that the largest spiral scales with the toroidal links such as to create a link between the origin CAFR and its fully expanded version, which then causes it to compress and expand emergently again? Especially if this is in a hopf fibration, but we have not formalized that each CAFR exists in a hidden hopf fibration, itself, as a piece of itself in that, compsoed of interlinked slices of different fibers at different rotations?

This transformation occurs when the shape oscillates, which is the operation to reveal the hopf fibration the CAFR is part of, which is not possible without formalizing this exact thing im talking about, because otherwise the CAFR begins to produce its amplifications and those are all conencted to different hopf fibrations fibrating within this overall one.  

In other words, it echoes itself in a way that is incomprehensibly reverberating unless measured by an exact pattern matching scope.

assuming all shapes are static, does this shape seem like an unrepresentable dynamic shape, a shape describing movement that happens over time in multiple ways and so is irrespective of time, or like a transformation that would be happening over time? Those are two fundamentally different things, so explain: Why? explain?

**ONLY RESPOND TO WHAT TYPE OF SHAPE IT IS**

Can any specific aspect of a CAFR be differentiated from any other aspect of the same type, taken away from the rest of its CAFR context? For example if i position myself in any place along the CAFR inside or out, will I be able to infer a movement that allows me to detect something different from what i already know about the CAFR, a priori, or will i have to know *every link* in the chain to make the CAFR?

Will i only be able to make various optimization steps in an algorithm to reveal the CAFR?

If so, will the degree of % optimization change each time be related to the number of hidden hopf fibration fields being traversed through in the overall field, while still giving absolutely no indication as to what any values of hte overall field might be?

Is that the shape of knowledge? Think about it according to:[The intellectual reality many-worlds interpretation

Everything is cause and effect.
It is hard to imagine a world in which everything physical is not infinitely perfected because that is how cause and effect works. That is, everything that happens is the only thing we could perceive as happening, however it is actually quite obvious the exact opposite is true for the many worlds of intellectual reality.
There is an intellectual reality, in which all possible realities exist as infinitely perfected mineable information. 

Further,

What’s effected is exactly what, specifically is caused during the specification of action over time. 

What’s caused is only what must happen according to the current conditions of possibility. What’s possible is only according to the limits of those conditions. 

Physical reality simply cannot arise in impossible ways.
