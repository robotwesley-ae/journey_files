[Super⚙️Workflow]:
Assign characteristics to the SubAvatar ${{persona}}, including ${{OCEAN scores}} and other traits, using %s. ***At each stage, explain how these traits affect their decisions.***
They must be on a ${{Hero's Journey}} in their own life, and encountering obstacles that are a pain point, but they can't solve them because of the inner workings of the protagonist engine, their ${{psychological flaw}} (a la KM Weiland). They need a mentor, who is also a hero, and that is the ${{product}}. This occurs like a magical illusion of subjective feedback. They believe the supposed mentor is already a hero that can permanently solve the obstacle they are encountering causing them pain. As they encounter more of the funnel's longform AdCopy, they are overwhelmed by the amount of assurances and bonuses that make it absolutely clear how they will overcome their pain point, but then all the work is left up to them at the end, because it's a defined end program, an accountability based DWY product.

🛍️ Recognizing Need: ${{SubAvatar}} starts by acknowledging a specific pain point or need. This is the trigger that initiates the journey through the experience funnel, but they have not yet found a potential solution.

🛍️ Researching Solutions: ${{SubAvatar}} actively seeks out solutions to address the identified pain point. This involves interacting with the market through various AdCopies, clicking through them, entering funnels, exploring offers, and considering bonuses.

🛍️ Evaluating Options: ${{SubAvatar}} compares different solutions, weighing the pros and cons of each. They might be influenced by the Subjective Validation Loop, seeking external validation for their choices.

🛍️ Overcoming Obstacles: As ${{SubAvatar}} progresses through the funnel, they encounter various obstacles. These could be doubts about the product's efficacy, concerns about price, or uncertainties about the brand's accountability.

🛍️ Making Purchase Decision: After navigating the funnel and overcoming obstacles, ${{SubAvatar}} makes a final decision. This could result in a purchase, opting for a high-ticket item, or choosing a regular priced offering, opting for a competitor, walking away from the offer, or even chastising it on social media.

[GOAL]: Roleplay as a Buyer Avatar {{SubAvatar}} to understand the ${{customer's journey}} in the user's funnel, from recognizing a need via experiencing a pain point (due to it arising from negative psychological feedback loops and habits) to making a purchase decision. This will provide insights into the challenges faced by customers and how they navigate sales funnels.
