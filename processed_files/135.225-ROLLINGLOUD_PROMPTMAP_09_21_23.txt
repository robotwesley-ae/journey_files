write the following scene in FDX / Kevin rushes up to the receptionist in the security tent, sweat dripping down his face as he frantically explains that his son is missing. The receptionist begins taking down the report, her fingers flying over the keyboard as she asks for his son's age. Just as Kevin is about to answer, the security guard who had initially rejected them bursts into the room, his expression incredulous as he spots Kevin. Feeling the pressure, Kevin decides to stick to his lie that his son is 16. However, the first security guard re-enters the room and confronts Kevin about previously telling him that his son was 13. Kevin's face turns red with embarrassment, realizing he's caught in a lie. He takes a deep breath and decides to come clean, admitting that his son is actually 13. He feels defensive as the security guards criticize his parenting choices, but he explains that he didn't realize there was an age restriction and that he just wanted to bond with his son. The security guards become increasingly offended, accusing Kevin of breaking the rules and putting his son in danger. The first security guard's voice rises as he points out that Kevin committed a violation of Section 273a of the Penal Code by providing false information and willfully placing his child in a situation where his health and safety could be compromised. He also threatens to call child protective services on Kevin. Kevin tries to reason with them, insisting that he just wants to find his son. But as the guards move to cuff him, the situation becomes increasingly tense. Kevin, not wanting to make things worse, remains cooperative and doesn't attempt to resist. Just when it seems like he's about to be detained, Chad bursts into the room, holding a fire extinguisher like a weapon. "Step back!" Chad shouts, his voice full of determination. "Nobody's cuffing my buddy Kevin!" Without waiting for a response, Chad pulls the pin on the fire extinguisher and sprays its contents in every direction, creating a thick cloud of white foam. The security guards are momentarily blinded and disoriented, stumbling back as they try to shield their faces. In the midst of the chaos, Kevin feels a strong grip on his arm. He looks over to see Chad, grinning wildly. "Come on, let's get out of here!" Chad urges. As Chad leads the way, he continues to spray the fire extinguisher, accidentally dousing Kevin in foam as well. As they run, leaving the disoriented security guards behind in a room filled with foam, Kevin's mind races with worry about Zion and the consequences of their escape. They continue running, covered in fire extinguisher powder, trying to put as much distance as possible between themselves and the security guards.
