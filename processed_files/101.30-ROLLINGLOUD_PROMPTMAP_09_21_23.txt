Jeremy frantically searches the festival grounds, looking for any sign of Zion. He runs to the security checkpoint, hoping they can help him locate his son. The security guard tells him to go to the lost and found area and gives him directions. Jeremy races over to the lost and found area, but it's closed. He tries to pry the door open, but it's locked tight. He starts to shout Zion's name, hoping that his son can hear him, but there's no response. He feels like he's running out of options and starts to panic. He thinks about making a PA announcement, but he doesn't even know where to begin. He tries to find a festival employee who can help him, but they're all too busy dealing with the massive crowds. Jeremy feels like he's tried everything, but he can't give up. He remembers a story he read about a father who lost his son at a crowded beach and managed to find him by getting everyone on the beach to help look for him. He starts to shout Zion's name again, this time at the top of his lungs. He hopes that someone will hear him and help him find his son. As he's shouting, he sees a group of people staring at him. They're dressed in wild outfits and have brightly colored hair. He feels self-conscious and embarrassed, thinking that they're judging him. But then, one of them approaches him. "Hey man, are you okay?" the guy asks. "I lost my son," Jeremy says, tears welling up in his eyes. The guy puts a comforting hand on Jeremy's shoulder. "Don't worry, we'll help you find him," he says, and introduces himself as Dave. Dave and his friends start to spread out, shouting Zion's name and asking anyone they come across if they've seen him. Jeremy is amazed at how kind and helpful they are, especially considering they're strangers at a music festival. After several minutes of searching, one of Dave's friends spots Zion. He's standing near one of the stages, watching a performance. Jeremy runs over to him, feeling relieved and overjoyed. Zion looks up at his dad, surprised and a little confused. "Where were you?" he asks. "I was looking for you," Jeremy says, pulling him into a tight hug. Zion tells him he had to go further into the festival to find a restroom, but he made it back just in time for the next performance. Jeremy is grateful to have found his son and even more grateful to have met Dave and his friends, who helped him when he needed it most.
