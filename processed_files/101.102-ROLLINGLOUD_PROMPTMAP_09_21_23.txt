
ZION
(wistfully)
Yeah, but... I wanted him here with me.

Suddenly, PLAYBOI CARTI & KEVIN'S voices fill the air, delivering the opening lyrics to "Sky".

PLAYBOI CARTI & KEVIN
(on stage, singing)
"I told my boy, go on like 10 blunts for me
I told my boy, go on, get bands for me..."

CUTE GIRL
(surprised)
Who is that?

As Zion turns to the JUMBOTRON, images of Kevin on stage with Playboi Carti illuminate the screen. The crowd collectively gasps.

PLAYBOI CARTI & KEVIN
(on stage, singing)
"Popped another one
Now I gotta "Sky", now I gotta pour me one..."

Zion's eyes widen in disbelief.

ZION
(amazed)
That's my Dad...on stage!

Overcome with excitement, he plunges into the crowd, heading towards the stage.

ZION
(yelling)
DAD!!!

The Cute Girl, startled, hurries after Zion.

ON STAGE - CONTINUOUS

As the spotlight shines on Kevin, he matches Carti's fiery energy, their spirited performance amplified on the jumbotron. 

KEVIN
(singing, energized)
"Go and get your racks, go and get your bands
I told my mom I'm gonna be the man..."

Continue writing these sequence in FDX and have Zion and the cute girl make their way to the front of the stage to cheer on Kevin. When they get there, Linda and Chad are having the time of their lives, dancing and moshing. Write the entire performance out with all of this in mind.

Kevin, lost in the music and the moment, is a beacon of raw, infectious energy. His voice melds with Playboi Carti's, their synchrony creating a uniquely powerful rendition of "Sky".

PLAYBOI CARTI & KEVIN
(on stage, singing)
"I told my boy, go on like ten blunts for me
I told my boy, go on, get bands for me..."

The crowd roars its approval, matching the energy and passion radiating from the stage. Kevin scans the crowd, spotting Zion, the Cute Girl, Linda, and Chad dancing, cheering, living in the moment.

KEVIN
(to himself, grinning)
This... this is amazing.

The performance continues, a shared experience of joy and music that binds everyone together under the night sky.

Rewrite, but Zion shouldn't be holding hands with the girl. She should just be following. Zion should only be focused on his dad on stage. at some point, Zion and his Dad, Kevin, make eye contact, Zion yells, "Dad!!!!!!" and Kevin hears him and drops the mic and dives into the crowd and they embrace in a HUGE hug and all start mosh pitting together!
