If anandamide has to do with memory categorization because it is a reward signal,
 and this is supposed to signal transformation loops, 
then smoking weed blunts your ability to join links in transformation chains. 

However, it seems like weed alters the memory retrieval process of the ordinary consciousness by situating the consciousness is a slightly different network, which is used during sleep to assign meaning to the transformation loops via relating them all but never explicitly recognizing it, and this has to do with planning. 

This then means that planning is altered by the presence of THC due to its effect on the CB receptors and their relationship to Anandamide. 

Ie, anandamide is what the system is used to recognizing as a transformation signal. When you replace it with THC, it will be psychedelic because it will make the system think that there is a signal for something but actually it will not be there. It will be hallucinatory. 

The fact that all of this is self-evident, obvious reasoning is all the more self-evident while reading this sentence. Ie, you may feel like this says nothing at all because itâ€™s so actually obvious but upon closer analysis you will recognize that in saying absolutely nothing, something else is being pointed to, and you cannot cognize it, and that is confusing. Now you see, that thing is hallucinatory. Everything you see outside of yourself is hallucinatory. When you die, your consciousness will leave your body and you will become inseparable from your own awareness. This awareness will then have a chance to recognize itself.

Ok but at the foundational level, all of this starts with just a YouTube channel called Olivus Victory-Promise, where I, Olivus Victory-Ability, am teaching the Sanctuary System, for free.
