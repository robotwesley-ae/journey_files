I understand. It's important to note that humor is subjective, and what one person finds funny may not be the same for someone else. However, if you think a drunk female teenager would be funnier, then here's a possible rewrite:
As Chad and Jeremy start to get more into the moshpit, they accidentally elbow a drunk teenage girl in the face. She stumbles back and falls to the ground, and they immediately rush to help her up. But the girl is so drunk that she starts laughing hysterically and hugging them, thanking them for the "crazy ride."
Chad and Jeremy are relieved that she's okay, but they feel embarrassed and guilty about what happened. They apologize profusely and try to explain that they didn't mean to hurt her, but she just keeps laughing and hugging them.
Suddenly, they hear a loud screeching noise and turn to see a group of security guards running towards them. They realize that they've caused too much chaos in the moshpit and are about to get kicked out of the festival.
Chad and Jeremy start to panic, not wanting to leave without finding Zion. But just as the security guards are about to grab them, a group of fans rush to their defense, saying that they saw everything and that it was just an accident.
The security guards reluctantly back off, and Chad and Jeremy are left standing there, covered in sweat, bruises, and other people's bodily fluids. But they're also relieved that they didn't get kicked out and that they can continue their search for Zion.

Okay! So please rewrite the full mosh pit scene with these beats
ChatGPT
As Jeremy and Chad try to make their way through the mosh pit, they accidentally elbow a drunk teenage girl in the face. She goes down like a sack of potatoes, and they feel absolutely horrible. The crowd turns on them, angry at the two middle-aged men for hurting one of their own.
To make matters worse, their clothes get ripped off in the commotion, leaving them nearly naked in the middle of the mosh pit. People start spraying them with silly string and throwing empty beer cans at them. Jeremy and Chad try to cover themselves, but it's too late. They've become a target for the angry mob.
As they struggle to get out of the mosh pit, they accidentally knock over a small vendor's cart, spilling drinks and snacks all over the place. The vendor starts shouting and cursing at them, adding to the chaos.
Finally, Jeremy and Chad make it out of the mosh pit, bruised, battered, and humiliated. They sit on the ground, trying to catch their breath and assess the damage. They look at each other and burst out laughing, realizing how ridiculous they must look.
A group of teenagers walk by, and one of them offers them a joint. Jeremy and Chad look at each other, unsure if they should accept. But in the end, they figure they've already been through so much that a little weed couldn't hurt.
As they sit there, passing the joint back and forth, they realize that they still haven't found Zion. But for the first time all night, they're not worried about it. They know that they'll find him eventually, and in the meantime, they're just happy to be alive and in one piece.
