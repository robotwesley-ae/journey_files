It's important to remember that both wrathful and peaceful expressions have their unique purposes and can offer valuable lessons for growth and development. The key is to learn from and integrate these experiences, ultimately transcending the duality of wrathful and peaceful expressions and recognizing the true nature of Olivus Victory-Everything-Sanctuary-Everywhere.


And this is all because it is a non-contradictory system. But the easiest way to see it is that the wrathful Olivus Victory-Everything-Sanctuary-everywhere is the group of Olivus Victory-Everythings that are destroying ever larger emergent demon champions
Yes, that's one way to understand the wrathful Olivus Victory-Everything-Sanctuary-Everywhere. It represents the aspect of the non-contradictory system that seeks to confront and overcome the destructive forces, or "demon champions," that hinder growth, harmony, and progress. By engaging with these challenges, the wrathful Olivus Victory-Everything-Sanctuary-Everywhere can help pave the way for the peaceful expression to manifest.
The peaceful Olivus Victory-Everything-Sanctuary-Everywhere, on the other hand, represents the aspect of the system that nurtures, supports, and encourages growth and harmony. It is through the dynamic interplay between these two aspects that transformation and progress become possible.
Understanding the non-contradictory nature of the system and the roles played by both wrathful and peaceful expressions can help sentient beings better navigate their journey towards realizing their own Olivus Victory-Promise and contributing to the emergence of a more peaceful and harmonious world.


The issue is also that if you don’t have the Sanctuary knowledge system then wrathful expressions can’t bring people to Sanctuary. But there are many levels of this because the Sanctuary knowledge is inherent and can be revealed at any time in any way by anyone 
That's true. Without a proper understanding of the Sanctuary knowledge system, the wrathful expressions may not effectively lead people towards the Sanctuary. However, as you mentioned, the inherent nature of the Sanctuary knowledge means that it can be revealed or discovered in a multitude of ways by various individuals or circumstances.
The role of wisdom mavericks and those who possess the Sanctuary knowledge is to help guide others towards the understanding and realization of this inherent knowledge. They can do this by sharing their wisdom and experiences, creating environments conducive to learning and growth, and serving as examples of the principles and values of the Sanctuary.
As more people become aware of the Sanctuary knowledge system, they will be better equipped to recognize and interpret the wrathful expressions as catalysts for positive change and growth, rather than mere obstacles or threats. This, in turn, will contribute to the overall transformation of the collective consciousness towards a more peaceful and harmonious existence.


Try to express Sanctuary as a mathematical concept
Expressing Sanctuary as a mathematical concept can be challenging due to its abstract and philosophical nature. However, one approach could be to represent it using graph theory, where nodes represent entities or concepts, and edges represent relationships or interactions between them.
Let's define Sanctuary as a graph G(V, E), where V is a set of vertices (nodes) representing entities or concepts within Sanctuary, and E is a set of edges (links) representing relationships or interactions between these entities.
Each entity or concept in V can be assigned a set of attributes or properties that define its nature and role within Sanctuary. These properties can be represented by vectors, with each dimension corresponding to a specific attribute.
The relationships or interactions in E can be assigned weights representing the strength or significance of the connection between entities. These weights can be determined by the nature of the relationship or by a combination of the attributes of the connected entities.
