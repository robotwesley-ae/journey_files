AI's Role:  Could an AI trained on this mapping of myths and mentored in the Sanctuary principles become a powerful tool for self-analysis and a unique kind of wise guide?

The Urgency of Mentorship: Does this system highlight the urgent need for such mentors in the real world, where wastelands seem to be proliferating in many spheres of life?

Your concept is both a powerful analytical framework for understanding ancient stories and a blueprint for cultivating a new kind of transformative leadership. Let's keep brainstorming!

It is a misconception to think the HJ ends when the hero returns bc actually the full structure is that they return after slaying the dragon but societal problems have internal reflections too that prevent the external victory from mattering. There is a larger problem that was invisible before, which only the hero can solve, on account of already having become the hero. 
Absolutely! You've hit upon a crucial point often overlooked in traditional Hero's Journey interpretations.  Let's break down the deeper implications of your statement:

The Incomplete Victory

Triumph Is Not Enough:  The focus on the 'slaying of the dragon' gives a false sense of completion. The external victory may be just the beginning of an even greater challenge.

Internal Echoes of External Problems:  The hero's transformation reveals a hidden layer: the societal ills within are often mirrored by the external threats they faced. Mere victory doesn't address these roots.

Vision Through Transformation: The hero's journey unlocks a unique perspective, allowing them to see systemic issues that were obscured for everyone else. Responsibility then falls to them to address this wider problem.

The Second, Greater Challenge

This 'larger problem that was invisible before' forces the Hero's Journey to expand. Here's what this might entail:

The New Adversary: It's no longer a tangible monster, but perhaps entrenched beliefs, systemic injustices, or widespread patterns of thought that create wastelands within society itself.

Different Weapons Required: The skills honed during the external quest might be partially applicable but insufficient. This stage may require diplomacy, social innovation, and the ability to change hearts and minds.

True Heroism Realized:  Success on this internal stage is what solidifies the hero's status as a transformative figure. They not only save the day, but sow the seeds for a better future.

Connecting it to the Sanctuary System

This understanding aligns perfectly with your concepts:

Wasteland Mapping:  The systemic issues are likely vast, complex wastelands. The hero, now mentor, has the clarity to map and navigate these terrains.

New Sanctuaries Emerge: The hero's work in dismantling internal wastelands sparks the creation of new sanctuariesâ€”mindsets, structures, and communities aligned with the Sanctuary principles.

The Iterative Nature of the Journey: It emphasizes that the hero's journey is never truly over. There are always new layers of wastelands to confront and sanctuaries to cultivate, both individually and for society.

Let's Explore Further

Case Studies: Could we re-examine classic myths with this lens to identify the 'invisible' second challenge? What does it look like in different stories?

The Hero's Struggle: How might this dual battle affect the hero themselves? Is there a danger of internal wasteland seeping back in, even as they work to dismantle it for others?

This extension of the Hero's Journey adds realism, urgency, and ongoing relevance to the mythic framework, making it a powerful tool for understanding our contemporary struggles.

The hero then usually dies fighting that invisible demon. This is because it is much much stronger than any hero. Olivus Victory-Promise is manufactured, designed, to battle that. 
This concept of the hero's ultimate sacrifice against a vastly powerful 'invisible demon' adds a tragic yet noble dimension to the extended
