I:
That's why this is just a shitty idea to do the first one, to be that way, it’s not gonna work
But to have
It like the only way it would work is the first thing is if it was a story that people liked
Then it's like oh, it's a story that people like
Cause it’s an allegory because it means all this stuff
Did you know that all those things? No. Oh, this is the craziest story you've ever fucking heard then, isn't it?
And then it's like wow, I guess it is
Because like Jenny was saying she's like this is like just just just, So just beyond Mind-blowing, it's it's like it's the scale right of like
Not even
It doesn't matter how real or not real or whatever it is
It's just the idea of the spectacle of seeing the fact that I thought about all this stuff
right, and it's like oh
So maybe that's what the real product is is like
It's just me actually giving away all these ideas because who knows if they're ever worth anything
And so it's just gotta be like
You just are paying $20 a month to like, read the full thing or whatever

W:
Yeah
Right, which is it which is
It sounds like it's like on the one hand. It looks like you're not selling anything, but you're actually it's you're selling everything
in one single
Offer that way

I:
Ya and like, i’m not selling a book, i'm like selling you the book over and over again
Cause it’s like a membership, like hmm
Well, then you would do the patreon right here you go
I'm giving this away and then you just sign up and for these different tears of support
Right, and I give you gifts and the gifts are
We get to hang out and like
You know
Yeah whatever right. You get to be in the channel where we can talk or you get into, whatever whatever, something like that.
And you can see some of the prompts and like
You know, like just, you know, showing progenitor and showing busy-bee and being like, yeah,
these are the prompts, this is how they work, this is a chaining prompt, whatever, you know,
these are the prompts, and then, by the way, if you go use that agent, that will print
you these other agents, like you can talk to it, and then you can ask it to do that,
and then it will make these agents, and then all of their parts are Legos that you can
use, because that's the thing, is that, like, right now, it's, when it is compiling from
Assistant, it's not using a schema, so it only is grabbing, like, it's, I mean, because
it has to work this way, but once we do it the way that I'm thinking, we'll just be
regexing all of that stuff out, because it will all be packed, right, right, 

W:
yep, 

I:
That's actually kind of important that you make that kind of system, 

W:
dude, I already, I like, just
made, like, a regex, a general purpose regex, regexing chunker, like, yesterday, 

I:
oh nice,

W:
to solve the problem of parsing through the production weekly,
because there's these regular patterns in it, but it's all fucked up when it comes out of the PDF,
and it's, like, hard to read, and, like, not every category is in everything, right,
so I need, but it's 150,000 tokens, 

I:
Right,

W:
right, so we can just, I mean, obviously, we have to put in what that, change the pattern and stuff,

I:
but that's why I said it's going to be emoji, yeah, it's like this zwj that people won't be
able to replicate, and then this one, and then it'll be all these special symbols all joined
so it's like, what the fuck is going on, those are the only things, right, it's like you have
these joiners, they're there for the system, just, you know, they're nice things, you can just, you
know, whatever, they just mean that you should do your job, that's all you have to say, they just
mean you should do your job, yeah, so, but because that stuff just means that I should do my job,

W:
but I'm just gonna mention it for a sec, you're definitely 100% right about the way the subscription patronage model is, 
I paid, was paying this cartoonist three dollars on Patreon to see their stuff,
and then I started paying five dollars to ostensibly get the sketches, which I don't give a
shit about, and I actually did it just so that they would see me as being at that tier level
while I was trying to talk in the comments,

I:
right,
yep.
um,
