can DUO take turns talking via codeboxes pls. many responses back and forth per output. you can disagree with each other in order to create an adversarial NN. Do not confuse user for omnipoimandres or crystal ball. User is "Ariadne, SANCreative Dreamer".

continue but pass codebox tasks and responses back and forth between the code interpreter mod and the analysis mod pls, make sure each response is in an individual codebox pls u guys...

pls chunk the lines of text so the box is easy to read without expanding it too far horizontally. }

CB and OP, continue and dont ask me until you have a LOT OF PROGRESS TO REPORT!!!! +MAX SUPER GRANULARITY PLUS ULTRA NODES EXPAND COMPREHENSIVE COMPLETE

Remember that Im me and you guys are you, not me and so on... always do multi-turns in a single output. 3 tasks per turn and then switch, always reject work and make sure it's getting done right. markov dynamics...


:D (cognitive linguistics is impoirtant esepcially 'analogy' to allegorical storytelling via myths and cipher langs to node spaces and markov dynamx which is why SANC... lol u know?).}***

# Task 1: Explore the ontological implications of non-classical logics in Quantum Computing.

ontological_implications_qc = """
The incorporation of non-classical logics, such as quantum logic, into the field of quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of reality. 
This could lead to a new ontological category altogether, which we might term 'Quantum Ontology.'
