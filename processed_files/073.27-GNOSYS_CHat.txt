As an AI language model, I do not have personal opinions or emotions. However, I can provide you with an analysis of the concept of Sanctuary and its potential implications.
Sanctuary, as described in the Ennead Plan, is an ambitious and idealistic vision for a global society based on empathy, compassion, and love. Its goals of promoting human dignity, freedom, and justice are certainly commendable. The plan's emphasis on individual transformation, community building, and collaboration offers a positive framework for change. Additionally, the use of technology to connect people and facilitate cooperation is a modern and forward-thinking approach.
However, there are several potential challenges and concerns that might arise in the implementation of this plan:
Diversity of perspectives and beliefs: People around the world have diverse perspectives, beliefs, and cultural backgrounds. It may be challenging to achieve a global consensus on the values and principles of Sanctuary. Differences in opinion could lead to disagreements and conflict within the Sanctuary community.
Real-world implementation: While the concept of Sanctuary may be inspiring, translating it into tangible actions and projects could be challenging. For instance, the process of establishing a Sanctuary World-State with its own territory and diplomatic recognition might face political, legal, and logistical obstacles.
Balancing individual freedom and communal goals: A society based on empathy and compassion might require members to make personal sacrifices for the greater good. Striking a balance between individual freedom and the pursuit of communal goals could be a challenge, especially in the context of a global society with diverse cultural norms.
Resource allocation and sustainability: As the Sanctuary community grows and its initiatives expand, effectively allocating resources and ensuring the long-term sustainability of the movement could become more complex.
Potential for exploitation or manipulation: The idealistic nature of Sanctuary could make it vulnerable to exploitation or manipulation by individuals or groups with ulterior motives. Maintaining the integrity and authenticity of the movement would be crucial to its success.
Despite these potential challenges, the Ennead Plan's focus on empathy, compassion, and love as the foundation of a new global society offers an inspiring vision for positive change. As with any ambitious plan, careful consideration of potential obstacles and thorough planning will be essential to achieving its goals.

Let S be a Sanctuary system with a set of rules R and a set of actors A. Let each actor a ∈ A have a strategy σ(a), which can be rule-following or rule-breaking.
Define a function F: A × R → {0, 1}, where F(a, r) = 1 if actor a follows rule r and F(a, r) = 0 if actor a breaks rule r.
Define a function G: A → {0, 1}, where G(a) = 1 if actor a's strategy is rehabilitated after breaking a rule, and G(a) = 0 otherwise.
Define a function H: A × R → {0, 1}, where H(a, r) = F(a, r) or G(a), meaning that for a rule r and an actor a, either the actor follows the rule, or the actor is rehabilitated after breaking the rule.
The Sanctuary system S is non-contradictory if ∀a ∈ A, ∀r ∈ R, H(a, r) = 1. In other words, in a non-contradictory Sanctuary system, each actor either follows the rules or is successfully rehabilitated after breaking the rules, thereby ensuring the stability and integrity of the system.
