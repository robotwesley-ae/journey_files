Utilize GPT-4 API to process market news and sentiment analysis, and to optimize the continuous surf strategy. Incorporate GPT-4 into the trading bot for assisting in decision-making.
Step 5: Implement risk management and profit maximization techniques.
Incorporate risk management strategies to minimize losses and optimize the continuous surf strategy to maximize profit potential. Focus on reducing transaction costs and effectively managing risk.
Step 6: Build the user interface and overall structure of the trading bot application.
Leverage the chosen no-code tool to create a user-friendly interface and a functional structure for the trading bot application. Enable users to monitor performance, adjust settings, and access trading insights generated by the bot.
Step 7: Test and optimize the trading bot.
Perform thorough testing of the trading bot, including backtesting the continuous surf strategy on historical data and running simulations to evaluate its performance. Identify areas for improvement and optimize the bot accordingly.
Step 8: Deploy the trading bot application.
Once the trading bot is thoroughly tested and optimized, deploy the application using the chosen no-code platform. Provide user access and monitor ongoing performance.
Step 9: Offer customer support and continuous improvement.
Provide customer support to users, addressing any issues or questions they may have. Continuously monitor the performance of the trading bot and make improvements to the strategy and application as needed.
Step 10: Scale and expand the trading bot application.
As the trading bot gains traction and user base grows, consider scaling and expanding the application, adding new features and integrations, and refining the continuous surf strategy for better performance.


those are really stages. now revise them to include classes of steps in the instructions
