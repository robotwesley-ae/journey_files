Across the table, ZION (13), glued to his phone, pays little attention to his old man. The pill bottle on the counter serves as a reminder of Zion's ADHD and anxiety.
Kevin draws on his mid-level executive experience.
KEVIN (pointing to the textbook) Okay, let's think of this equation like a living room set...
Zion looks skeptical. Kevin tries to hide his exasperation.
KEVIN Have you taken your meds?
ZION When's Mommy coming home?
KEVIN Can we focus? It's late. I'm tired.
There's a hint of something more going on with Kevin and his wife.
Zion's phone lights up. An announcement of the Rolling Loud festival.
ZION (excited) Dad, Rolling Loud just announced their lineup. Can we go?
KEVIN What's Rolling Loud?
Zion looks flabbergasted.
ZION The biggest hip-hop festival. Playboi Carti, Travis Scott, Lil Uzi Vert...
KEVIN (scanning Zion's phone) No. You're not going somewhere to see someone called Lil Uzi Vert!
ZION What about Carti?
KEVIN Cardi B?
ZION Playboi Carti!
Zion sings a line of explicit lyrics, and Kevin looks horrified.
KEVIN You're not helping your argument.
Kevin tries to convince Zion his era's Hip Hop was better, rapping Biggie Smalls' "Hypnotize". Zion's not impressed.
KEVIN (scrolling through Zionâ€™s phone) What kind of hip-hop festival has a horse?
Zion leaves, disappointed. Kevin watches him go, realizing the struggle between his protectiveness and his son's independence.
FADE OUT.
