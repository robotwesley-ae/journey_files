Rewrite the following, but instead of them smoking weed, the entire bus has weed smoke being circulated so everyone is just inhaling without even know it: As Kevin and Shenseea approach the Playbus, they notice a thick haze of smoke pouring out of the windows and vents. The pungent scent of marijuana fills the air, and Kevin's eyes water as he coughs and tries to clear his throat. Shenseea leads him up to the door, where two large, imposing bodyguards stand watch. They eye Kevin suspiciously as Shenseea whispers something to them, and they reluctantly step aside, allowing them to enter. As they step inside, Kevin is hit with a wave of heat and smoke. The inside of the bus is dark and hazy, with colorful lights flashing and music blaring from the speakers. The seats are covered in plush velvet, and there are ashtrays overflowing with cigarette butts and joints scattered everywhere. A group of rappers and their entourage sit sprawled out on the couches, passing around a joint as they laugh and joke with each other. Kevin feels out of place and nervous as he looks around, wondering where his son could be. As Kevin frantically explains the situation to Playboi Carti, the rapper looks at him quizzically. "I don't know what you're talking about, man," he says, shaking his head. "Zion's not on my bus." Kevin feels a knot of dread forming in his stomach. If Zion's not on the bus, then where could he be? As he fumbles with his phone to show Playboi the photo of Zion, he accidentally clicks on a new message from the two girls he met earlier. Playboi's eyes widen as he takes in the risque photo. "Damn, son," he says, laughing. "Looks like you're having a wild time out here." Kevin quickly scrolls past the photo, feeling embarrassed and frustrated. "That's not important," he says, trying to steer the conversation back to Zion. "I just need to find my son." Playboi nods sympathetically. "I feel you, man. Let me ask around and see if anyone's seen him." As Kevin waits anxiously, he can't help but wonder if he's made a terrible mistake in bringing Zion to the festival. He thought it would be a chance to bond over their shared love of music, but now it seems like everything has gone wrong. "Let me ask around and see if anyone's seen him," Playboi says sympathetically, never moving from his spot. As Kevin waits, his phone begins to ring. He glances at the caller ID and sees that it's his wife. "I'm not going to answer," he mutters, but Playboi lectures him about how you "always answer the wife." Kevin reluctantly picks up the phone, his wife saying that she's parking and walking towards the entrance. He quickly ends the call, feeling even more stressed than before. Kevin feels a wave of despair wash over him. He's lost his son in a sea of strangers, and he has no idea where to start looking. He can feel the weight of his mistakes bearing down on him.
