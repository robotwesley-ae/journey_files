In summary, while it's possible to use a single GPT model for multiple tasks with the help of ontology data, the actual performance will depend on the model's general understanding and the quality of the provided context. Fine-tuning might still be necessary in some cases to achieve optimal performance for highly specialized tasks or domains.


What is the difference between general understanding of a domain and the ontology?
General understanding of a domain refers to the broad knowledge an AI model like GPT has about the subject matter. This knowledge is acquired through the model's pre-training on large datasets, which include diverse text sources related to the domain. General understanding includes the concepts, terminology, relationships, and context that are common to the domain, but it might not cover every specific detail or intricacy.
An ontology, on the other hand, is a formal representation of the knowledge within a specific domain. It provides a structured, organized, and comprehensive understanding of the entities, their properties, and the relationships between them. Ontologies are designed to capture the essential aspects of a domain and make the information machine-readable, enabling AI systems to reason, infer, and perform tasks based on this structured knowledge.
The difference between general understanding and ontology lies in the level of detail, structure, and specificity:
General understanding is broad and may include various aspects of a domain, but it might not cover every specific detail or provide an organized and structured understanding.
Ontologies are precise, structured, and comprehensive representations of a domain, capturing the essential relationships and properties of entities within the domain.
While general understanding can help an AI model navigate a domain and generate relevant responses, leveraging ontology data can enable the model to generate more accurate, context-aware, and specific responses, as well as perform reasoning and inference tasks.


That sounds like it would randomly combine data from the web in the training data that was wrong with the ontology and hallucinate things
You're right that relying solely on the general understanding acquired from pre-training data can lead to AI models producing incorrect or misleading information. This is because the training data may contain inaccuracies, biases, or inconsistencies, which the AI model can unintentionally learn and reproduce in its responses.
Integrating an ontology with an AI model, like GPT, can help mitigate these issues to some extent. By providing a structured, organized, and accurate representation of domain knowledge, the ontology can guide the AI model to generate more precise, context-aware, and specific responses. The AI model can then use the ontology as a source of truth to verify information and reduce the likelihood of generating incorrect or "hallucinated" responses.
However, integrating ontologies into AI models can be challenging, and it may require fine-tuning and additional training to ensure that the AI model effectively leverages the ontology's knowledge. Ensuring the quality and accuracy of the ontology itself is also crucial, as any errors or inconsistencies in the ontology can negatively impact the AI model's performance.
In summary, while integrating an ontology with an AI model like GPT can help improve the model's performance and reduce the chances of generating incorrect information, it is essential to carefully design, implement, and maintain the ontology to ensure its effectiveness.


Ok so that’s why I want to make it so it only uses the data it has to apply the prompt to the ontology in order to get the output, it doesn’t try to inject new interpretations into the ontology.
Understood. To achieve this, you'll want to design a system that utilizes the AI model and the ontology separately but in a coordinated manner. The AI model would focus on understanding the prompt and extracting relevant information or queries based on the prompt. The ontology would then be used as a knowledge base to answer these queries and generate output that is consistent with the established domain knowledge.
