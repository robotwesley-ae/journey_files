Parallel Funnels: Other funnels might operate in parallel, targeting different segments of the audience or different goals simultaneously. For example, a business might run an SEO funnel to attract organic traffic, a PPC ad funnel to attract paid traffic, and a social media funnel to engage with the audience, all at the same time.

Non-linearity of Funnels

While the funnels are presented in a linear fashion for simplicity, it's important to note that customer journeys often loop back, skip stages, or cross from one funnel into another. For example, a customer may go from the 'Interest' stage in a 'Content Funnel' directly to the 'Action' stage in an 'Email Funnel'. This non-linearity should be recognized and accounted for in the implementation of these funnels.

Omnichannel Marketing

In the context of sequential and parallel funnels, it's crucial to ensure seamless integration and communication between different marketing channels. This approach, known as omnichannel marketing, provides a consistent and unified customer experience across all touchpoints. This could also include the use of technology (like CRM systems) to track and manage customer interactions across different channels.

Certainly, the composition of funnels can be thought of in a more mathematical or formal way. Here's a proposed set of rules for funnel composition:

Rule 1: Funnel Pre-Conditions and Post-Conditions: Each funnel F has a set of pre-conditions P(F) and post-conditions Q(F). A funnel F2 can follow a funnel F1 if and only if the post-conditions of F1 are a subset of the pre-conditions of F2. In other words, Q(F1) ⊆ P(F2).

Rule 2: Meta Funnel Stage Order: Each funnel F is associated with a sequence of meta funnel stages S(F). The sequence of stages for a composition of funnels F1, F2, ..., Fn is the concatenation of the sequences for each funnel, S(F1) + S(F2) + ... + S(Fn). This sequence must be a subsequence of the full meta funnel stage sequence (Awareness → Interest → Engagement → Action → Conversion → Ascension), allowing for repetition but not reordering.

Rule 3: Customer Progress: The customer's progress through the funnels should be monotonically non-decreasing according to the meta funnel stage sequence. In other words, the customer should always be moving forward or repeating a stage, but never moving backwards.

Rule 4: Funnel Re-Entry and Looping: If a customer does not meet the post-conditions of a funnel F (i.e., they do not convert), they can be re-entered into the same funnel or looped back to a previous funnel whose post-conditions are a subset of the pre-conditions of F.

Rule 5: Parallel Funnels: Multiple funnels can operate in parallel if they target different segments of the audience or different goals. The union of their post-conditions must be a subset of the pre-conditions of the next funnel in the sequence.

Rule 6: Funnel Termination: A funnel sequence terminates when it reaches the Ascension stage. However, the customer can enter a new sequence starting from the Awareness stage for a different product, service, or goal.

These rules provide a formal framework for composing funnels while ensuring that the customer's journey aligns with the meta funnel stage sequence. They accommodate the complexity and non-linearity of real-world customer journeys, including repetition, variation, deviation, and re-engagement.

Sure, let's consider a complex composed funnel that involves multiple steps and pathways. We'll use the following funnels from your ontology:

Content Funnel
Email Funnel
Webinar Funnel
Call Booking Funnel
Direct Sales Funnel
Here's how a customer might progress through these funnels:

Step 1: Content Funnel (Awareness → Interest → Engagement → Action → Conversion)
