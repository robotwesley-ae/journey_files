 to keep reminding me."
Kevin's heart sinks as he remembers the day at the baseball game, how excited Zion had been to go. He remembers the way Zion's face had lit up as they walked through the stadium, how he'd proudly worn his new jersey and cap.
But then, during the seventh inning stretch, Zion had tripped and fallen down the stairs, breaking his arm in two places. Kevin had felt like the worst father in the world as he rushed Zion to the hospital, tears streaming down his face as he tried to comfort his son.
Since then, Kevin had been overly protective of Zion, not wanting to let him out of his sight for fear that something else would happen to him. But now, as he sits on the Playbus with Shenseea and Playboi Carti, he realizes that he needs to let go of his fears and let Zion make his own choices, even if it means getting hurt again.
He takes a deep breath and looks out the window, feeling a sense of determination wash over him. He's going to find Zion and make things right, no matter what it takes.

"Of course, Melanie. I remember," Kevin responds, his voice clipped. "I was the one there. You don't have to keep reminding me."
Memories of that fateful day at Disneyland flood back to Kevin. Zion had been so excited to go on all the rides, but Kevin had been preoccupied with work emails and phone calls. He had let his guard down for just a moment, and that's all it took.
Zion had wandered off, and by the time Kevin had realized he was missing, he was nowhere to be found. The frantic search that followed was one of the worst moments of Kevin's life.
Eventually, they found Zion. He was safe, but he had seen something that he couldn't forget. It had left him with emotional scars that still lingered to this day.
Kevin looks out the window of the Playbus, lost in thought. He knows that he needs to find Zion and make things right. He can't let the past continue to haunt them both.

Melanie can't help but feel a twinge of frustration at Kevin's reaction. "Remember what happened last time we took him to a crowded event?" she asks, her tone accusatory."Of course, Melanie.

Melanie can see the pain etched on Kevin's face and she softens her tone. "I know you remember, Kevin. I just don't want history to repeat itself. We need to be careful."
Kevin nods in agreement. "You're right. We'll be more vigilant this time."
As they approach the festival grounds, Kevin's heart starts to race. He knows that finding Zion in the sea of people will be like finding a needle in a haystack, but he's determined to do whatever it takes.
As they disembark from the Playbus, Kevin feels a surge of energy and determination. He knows that the final act of this journey is about to begin.
