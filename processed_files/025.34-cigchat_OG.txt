 inefficiently. we are not making a storyontology. we are making an informadlib ontology. u need to be extending the class towards higher emergent structure levels. u cannot go into storyontology without going through ALL of story levels and then getting back into psychology -> neuroscience -> processes -> cognition -> other subjects

im really specific and u guys are being super general. get with me :) continue

"Learning dragon behavior from Toothless, Hiccup is able to subdue the captive dragons during training, earning admiration from his peers but suspicion from Astrid."
Expert 1 - Narratology Specialist:
Looking at '[main_character]', we should also capture the arc or transformational journey the character undergoes in the narrative. So, let's rename this to 'main_character_as_narrative_arc_entity'.
Expert 2 - Semiotics Expert:
This 'main_character_as_narrative_arc_entity' can then be extended to 'main_character_as_narrative_arc_entity_and_symbolic_figure'. It acknowledges the symbolic importance of the main character in addition to their narrative role.
Expert 3 - Ontology Expert:
Let's further elevate it into a superclass, 'main_character_as_narrative_arc_entity_and_symbolic_figure_in_StoryPsychology'. This not only captures the character's role in the narrative but also their psychological journey that the narrative represents.
Expert 4 - Super Analytical Narrative Semiotician:
Excellent work capturing the importance of character arcs and the psychological journey of the character in the narrative. We must be aware, however, that these labels are broad. We must maintain context sensitivity when applying these templates to different narratives.
Current Informadlib status:
"Through [knowledge-acquisition-as-narrative-transformation] [learning-subject-as-narrative-motif-and-symbol] from [source/mentor: knowledge transfer], [main_character_as_narrative_arc_entity_and_symbolic_figure_in_StoryPsychology] successfully [applies_knowledge/verb: applied knowledge-to-context] during [specific_situation], earning [positive_reaction: collective reaction] from [group] but [negative_reaction: reaction-signifier] from [character: relationship-signifier]."

Do you see how completely different what im doing is from what you guys are doing? pls analyze what i have done here and find the ontological description for it so we can replicate it. it must have a completely defined ontological definition in terms of the designation of relationships according to emergent structures. Im not saying what i did is perfectly logical or complete, im just showing u guys an exact example of how i see this work. pls continue

Expert 1 - Narratology Specialist:
Looking at your approach, it appears that you're tracing Hiccup's character journey through a series of plot points and character arc stages, making specific connections to the narrative's emotional and psychological impact. You're identifying specific character, plot, and thematic elements within a structure that's much more detailed and specific than a conventional narrative framework.
Expert 2 - Semiotics Expert:
In your model, each element doesn't just represent a discrete entity; instead, it is signifying a broader concept or symbolic meaning. For example, 'Hiccup' isn't just a protagonist, but also signifies an 'InnovativeExplorerArchetype' within the 'BuddyLove' sub-genre. This seems to form an interrelated web of meanings, where every character, event, or concept is embedded within larger narrative, psychological, and symbolic contexts.
