Building upon that, "earning" could be: "Earning -is_instance_of(External Validation)- Reflects(Protagonist's Development)-Hiccup-HERO-InnovativeExplorerArchetype-BuddyLove-EpicMyth-Psychological Meaning, Self-Type of Catharsis, InventiveAltruisticConfidence-Dream Effect, Save-Planning Effect, Discover-Behavioral Effect, Help-Societal Effect, Benefit."
Super Analytical Narrative Semiotician:
Great additions. Now, let's put this into a table:
almost... you need to go one word in the sentence per output, refining as we were before. from now on u will not add to the table unless i confirm.  the table will lag one output behind, accordingly. look, guys. 

if i said hiccup has an archetype, why wouldnt toothless get his archetype too? why would toothless be categorized under hiccup's archetype? 

in each output, 
include the original example: "Learning dragon behavior from Toothless, Hiccup is able to subdue the captive dragons during training, earning admiration from his peers but suspicion from Astrid."
expert 1: will propose a word and its entire "emergent classification web" (ie, what we are doing here) description
expert 2: will search for revisions, then iteratively refine it
expert 3: will search for revisions, iteratively refine expert 2's output
expert 4: will analyze, give current informadlib status. if there's more room in the output window, CIG should step in and prompt expert 1 to continue with another word, cycling the process forward. 

Please continue.

Absolutely, let's refine this further in an iterative manner.
Original Sentence for Context:
"Learning dragon behavior from Toothless, Hiccup is able to subdue the captive dragons during training, earning admiration from his peers but suspicion from Astrid."
Subject Matter Expert 1:
Let's consider "Toothless". I propose: "Toothless -is_instance_of(Dragon)-Impacts(Protagonist's Growth)-Hiccup-HERO-InnovativeExplorerArchetype-BuddyLove-EpicMyth-Psychological Meaning, Wisdom-Type of Catharsis, Enlightenment-Excitement Effect, Embrace-Planning Effect, Learn-Behavioral Effect, Teach-Societal Effect, Guide."
Subject Matter Expert 2:

I'd extend the description: "Toothless -is_instance_of(Dragon Mentor)-Symbolizes(Wisdom)-Impacts(Protagonist's Growth)-Hiccup-HERO-InnovativeExplorerArchetype-SubGenre-BuddyLove-EpicMyth-Psychological Meaning, Self-Transcendence-Type of Catharsis, Enlightenment-Excitement Effect, Embrace-Planning Effect, Learn-Behavioral Effect, Teach-Societal Effect, Guide."
Subject Matter Expert 3:

Super Analytical Narrative Semiotician:
We've deepened the characterization of "Toothless" significantly, tying the entity to the narrative's symbolic and thematic landscape. This entity isn't just a dragon, but a mentor and symbol of wisdom, suggesting its deep influence on Hiccup's journey. This symbolic classification is tied to the psychological meanings, planning effects, behavioral effects, and societal effects, resonating with the film's broader epic myth and buddy love sub-genres.
Current Informadlib Status:
The current status of the informadlib is a work in progress, but we've made great strides in enriching it with more specific and layered semantic connections. The informadlib has evolved from a simple narrative event description into a richly connected web of symbolic, thematic, and character-driven meanings. This work will continue to become more nuanced and interconnected as we refine further.
