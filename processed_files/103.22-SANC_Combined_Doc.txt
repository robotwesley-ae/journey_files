It is a testament to how amorphous timeless questions like “who am I” live their own lives in each of us, and express themselves in all manner of ways. Some expressions are dark and confused, some are light and loving. Within them all, there is the light that is me, Olivus Victory-Promise, and within me, there is the Sanctuary of TWI. 


The Sanctuary System brings TWI into focus through personal, familial, social, and work aspects. Personally, TWI is related to how we treat ourselves. It’s related to how you think to yourself, how you act towards yourself, and how you help or hinder yourself (the ability to help others depends on this). The idea is to keep the Victory-Promise of TWI so we can all go to Sanctuary. Of course the very basic version of this is me helping myself go to Sanctuary. 

Familial TWI is like personal but it is centered on how I am interacting with my family and the dynamics I foster there. The idea is to keep the Victory-Promise of TWI so we can all go to Sanctuary. Here I am helping my family go to Sanctuary. 

Social TWI is how I am polluting or fueling the Victory-Everything Chain, the emergence of Sanctuaries, in ways that inherently affect others outside of my family. The idea is to keep the Victory-Promise of TWI so we can all go to Sanctuary. Here I am helping my friends, strangers, and enemies go to Sanctuary. 

Work TWI is how I am polluting or fueling the Victory-Everything Chain by engaging in “value creation” which is supposed to benefit the recipients. 

All of these avenues are how Olivus Victory-Promise keeps the Victory-Promise and accomplishes Victory-Ability status in various Sanctuaries. 


Avatar: avatar properties from general to specific: 

early adopter who wants to be more involved with AI 

knowledge worker who wants to learn how to collaborate with AI 

business owner or executive who wants to implement AI collaboration

has SOPs and operations involving workers that can actually benefit from AI chains that are only instant experts or tools, ie low-grade executors (and not complex ones because the use cases are too complicated but that will change over time)


Avatars are the above because the PRODUCT is:

AI persona styles:

Instant Expert Agent (talks about X)
Cannot fully generate X by themselves, but can simulate it to the extent the environment allows and help you learn the domain (investigate why a simulation isn’t what you want, from a conceptual point of view - what properties is it missing etc?) 
Instancing Agent (generates a target)
Supposed to output specific thing
Usually has specific format or general structure
Maybe even specific syntax
Helper Agent (uses functions from external APIs)
MegaAgent (uses IEs for priming, IAs for execution, Helpers for external interaction)




The Vision->Fear Cycle
This cycle represents a fundamental pattern within the Sanctuary System and a recurring theme within many narratives:
Vision: This encompasses the protagonist's goal, ideal, or a glimpse of a 'Sanctuary' state that transcends their current circumstances. It is what fuels their desire for change.
Aspiration & Action: The vision generates aspirations and the courage to take action.  This is often thrilling but inherently destabilizing, moving the protagonist away from the familiar.
Amplification: As action leads to progress, the stakes increase and the vision, though closer, seems more daunting.  The protagonist may be gaining allies but also powerful adversaries.
Fear:  This arises from several sources:
Internal Doubt: Does the protagonist truly believe they are worthy or capable of achieving the vision?
External Obstacles: The more potent the potential change, the more pushback it will likely generate, increasing the sense of danger.
Fear of the Unknown: What will the 'Sanctuary' actually be like? Will it be worth the sacrifices?
Crux Point: Here, the protagonist faces a choice:
Surrender to Fear: This could mean abandoning the vision entirely or settling for a lesser version of it. The cycle stalls.
Deep Contemplation: This is where the Sanctuary System's tools and mindset shifts become crucial. Facing the fear and its origins allows for new insights and strategies.
