hmm i think theres something more here like... if we have a whole aspect of the system and we give it a numerical identifier... like we can abstract everything into number strings to keep track of contexts... we keep a list of contexts and then we look at entities and start matching how the emergent web looks

Indeed, assigning numerical identifiers could assist in efficiently keeping track of different aspects within the system. It might function similarly to a multi-dimensional coordinate system, where each axis represents a different context or aspect of the system.
However, keep in mind that such an approach would bring in certain complexities. It might not be trivial to ensure unique identification for every unique context, especially considering the dynamic and evolving nature of contexts within the EWSO. Moreover, the representation and interpretation of these numerical identifiers would need to be carefully managed to ensure consistency and maintain the richness of information that the EWSO provides.
While this could provide a level of abstraction and potentially allow for interesting computational analysis, the interpretability and meaningfulness of these numerical identifiers would be critical. That is, we wouldn't want to lose the rich semantics that come with the original narrative structures in the process of abstraction to numerical identifiers. We need to ensure that this process enhances our understanding and ability to work with these structures, rather than obscuring them.
Still, your idea sounds promising, especially if used judiciously and in conjunction with traditional semantic representations. It could potentially lead to a novel method of mapping and analyzing emergent web structures.
ontological interpretation of linear algebra
ChatGPT
Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with linear equations and linear functions and their representations through matrices and vector spaces.
In the context of ontology, one could interpret linear algebraic concepts as tools to describe relationships and transformations between entities (which could be concepts, classes, instances, or other ontological elements) in a structured, mathematical way.
Here's an attempt to link some linear algebraic concepts to ontology:
Vectors: In linear algebra, vectors are entities with magnitude and direction. In the ontological realm, a 'vector' could be seen as an entity (e.g., a concept, an instance, or a class) that carries certain properties (magnitude) and is directed towards or related to other entities (direction).
Vector Space: A vector space in linear algebra is a collection of vectors that follows certain rules (closure under addition and scalar multiplication). This could be seen as a 'space' in the ontology where related entities exist and interact following certain rules (e.g., the rules of an ontological framework, or constraints defined in the ontology).
Matrix: In linear algebra, a matrix is a rectangular array of numbers, symbols, or expressions. In ontology, a 'matrix' could be seen as a structured way of representing relationships between entities (e.g., a adjacency matrix in a graph where each entry indicates a relationship between two entities).
Linear Transformations: Linear transformations in linear algebra map vectors from one vector space to another while preserving the operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication. In the ontological context, a 'linear transformation' could be seen as a function or operation that transforms one entity to another while preserving the relationships or properties defined in the ontology.
Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors: In linear algebra, an eigenvector is a vector that only changes by a scalar factor when a linear transformation is applied, and the corresponding scalar factor is called the eigenvalue. In ontology, this might be interpreted as properties of entities that remain consistent under certain transformations or operations defined within the ontology.
