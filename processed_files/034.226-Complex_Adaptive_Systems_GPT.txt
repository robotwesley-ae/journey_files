Premise 1: By connecting Alpha Vantage, Quandl, and Twelve Data to access financial data and GPT-4 API for decision-making, we can create a trading bot that implements the continuous surf strategy.
Axiom 2: GPT-4 can be integrated into applications via APIs.
GPT-4 API allows developers to access and utilize the capabilities of GPT-4 within their applications.
Premise 2: Integrating GPT-4 into the trading bot application can assist in decision-making, strategy optimization, and natural language understanding for processing market news and sentiment analysis.
Axiom 3: Financial trading bots make automated buy and sell decisions based on predefined rules and strategies.
Automated trading bots use algorithms, technical indicators, and other quantitative methods to execute trades.
Premise 3: Designing a trading strategy that implements continuous surf and integrates it into the trading bot will enable it to ride upward trends and avoid downward ones.
Axiom 4: Maximizing profit is the primary goal of a financial trading bot.
Profit maximization involves optimizing the trading strategy, minimizing transaction costs, and effectively managing risk.
Premise 4: To maximize profit, the trading bot should be designed with a focus on optimizing the continuous surf strategy, incorporating risk management, and minimizing trading fees.
Axiom 5: Continuous surf refers to the strategy of riding upward trends and avoiding downward ones.
Continuous surf strategy aims to capture gains in assets that are appreciating in value while avoiding or minimizing exposure to depreciating assets.
Premise 5: By implementing a continuous surf strategy, the trading bot can increase the likelihood of generating positive returns and reduce the risk of losses.
Axiom 6: Trading fees and rate of change differences affect the profitability of a trading strategy.
Transaction costs can significantly impact the overall performance of a trading strategy, especially when frequently trading in and out of positions.
Premise 6: The trading bot should account for trading fees and rate of change differences when making buy and sell decisions to ensure that these factors do not erode the profitability of the continuous surf strategy.
Axiom 7: Using a no-code tool like Bubble, Adalo, or Glide can facilitate the creation of the user interface and overall structure of the trading bot application.
These no-code tools allow for rapid development and deployment of applications with minimal coding knowledge.
Premise 7: By leveraging a no-code tool, we can efficiently build the trading bot application, allowing users to monitor performance, adjust settings, and access trading insights generated by the bot.

Stage 1: Choose a no-code platform for building the trading bot application.

Research and compare no-code platforms (Bubble, Adalo, Glide)
1.1. Identify the features and limitations of each platform
1.1.1. List the unique features of each platform
1.1.2. Note any limitations that may impact the trading bot development
1.2. Look for user reviews and case studies
1.2.1. Search for relevant reviews on forums and review websites
1.2.2. Analyze case studies to understand how others have used the platforms
1.3. Consider pricing and subscription plans
1.3.1. Compare the costs of each platform
1.3.2. Determine which plan best suits your budget and needs

Evaluate their ease of use, compatibility with Zapier, and support for API integration
2.1. Check if they provide native support for Zapier or require additional setup
2.1.1. Explore each platform's integration options
2.1.2. Assess the complexity of connecting with Zapier
2.2. Investigate the types of APIs each platform can handle (REST, GraphQL, etc.)
2.2.1. Check the platforms' documentation for API support details
2.2.2. Ensure the platform can handle the APIs of financial data sources
2.3. Assess the platform's learning curve and available resources
2.3.1. Estimate the time needed to become proficient with the platform
2.3.2. Evaluate the quality and depth of tutorials and documentation

Select the platform that best suits your requirements and desired features
