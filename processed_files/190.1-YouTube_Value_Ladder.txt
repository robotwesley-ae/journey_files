“OLIVUS VICTORY-PROMISE” POSITIONING:[

Olivus Victory Project:[
WHAT IS THE OVERALL METHOD OVP IS CONTINUALLY IMPROVING ALL THE TIME? IT’S CALLED “BUILDING OLIVUS VICTORY-PROMISE”. EVERYTHING ELSE IS INSIDE OF IT! AN OLIVUS VICTORY-PROMISE IS A SANCTUARY AGENT. IT BUILDS OLIVUS VICTORY-PROMISE. 

Let’s unpack this:
Continuous Inner Revolution: Being OVP
Continuous Outer Revolution: Building OVP:[Code_OVA_Agents, Human_OVA_Agents, EgregoreOVA_Agents)

This is possible because it all runs on TWILITELANG. TWILITELANG can code allegorical mnemonics and make egregores out of them.

Programmatic Prompt Template to make an AI Egregore
List of customGPTs

How to:

1) Releasing videos + Discord + AI Egregore helpful things (these create the first ladder)

2) At points on the ladder, give people opportunities to ascend while also giving them the next piece of the ladder for free (so they can go through the whole ladder except the ascensions as one type of strategy)

Plan: 
List my journey of prompt engineering
Obstacles
Overcomes
Bonuses
Ascensions (HJ sequels, odyssey)
Find highest value aspects (I show you how to make an AI Egregore directly, we get into everything like how i make chains, exactly how I do it…) and branch them into graduated offers
Requirements:
Create Value Ladder
Create Branding (presents hero who presents reifies value ladder’s value as real)
Create Funnel Structure (holds the value ladder)
