And [Task] please write new definitions for EWSO, Informadlib, Informadlib Template, Informadlib Template Template, and SemOntoRel according to your understandings now. Please be concise as possible without losing any meaning. Be sure to capture the entire meaning. We need to be precise. This project is IMPORTANT. [/Task]

AI Smith, Ontologist: Absolutely, let's work together to refine these definitions.
[EWSO] (Emergent Web Structure Ontology): The EWSO represents a super-hierarchical, dynamic ontology of the full emergent structure of any instance across theoretical domains. It functions as a creativity purposive ontology, guiding the creation of an Informadlib via an Informadlib Template and aids in generating corresponding natural language instances or instructions. The EWSO encapsulates the pervasive wisdom in valuation processes and cultural memes, aiming to purify the societal context through wise valuation.
[Informadlib]: The Informadlib is a dynamically generated multidimensional data structure that encapsulates an entity's state within the EWSO at a given moment. It is crafted using an Informadlib Template and carries details like entity properties, related classes, subclasses, and relationships. The Informadlib functions as a medium for translating the EWSO's wisdom-infused structure into a communicable format.
[Informadlib Template]: An Informadlib Template is a dynamic blueprint for creating specific instances of Informadlibs. It reflects the creator's path through the EWSO and adapts as the creator explores different entities and their properties. The Informadlib Template is an instrumental tool in generating a Natural Language instance or its instructions.
[Informadlib Template Template]: The Informadlib Template Template is a meta-level blueprint designed to generate Informadlib Templates. It encapsulates the core structure and the process of creating Informadlib Templates, enabling the iterative refinement of Informadlibs in response to evolving exploration within the EWSO.
[SemOntoRel] (Semantic Ontological Relationship): SemOntoRel represents the semantic and ontological relationships within the EWSO, operating at various levels from the instance to the class level. It is a mechanism that encapsulates the transformation of instance-level value clusters into class-level value waves. SemOntoRel serves as the structural backbone of the EWSO, ensuring the accurate and meaningful representation of relationships in the resulting Informadlibs.


please include the exact SemOntoRel definition, according to a formalized expression that is recognizable, considering "the SemOntoRel seems to define a relationship starting from a low-level instance (like a specific word or phrase), up through progressively higher-level classes (from genre to societal effect), capturing the mappings between these different layers. Each transition from instance to class, or class to superclass, is characterized by a particular action or effect." and what u know now

AI Smith, Ontologist: Of course. Let's reformulate the definition for [SemOntoRel] (Semantic Ontological Relationship):
[SemOntoRel] (Semantic Ontological Relationship): SemOntoRel is a formalized mapping that captures the dynamic semantic and ontological relationships within the EWSO. It starts at the instance level (such as a specific word or phrase), progresses through various classes (e.g., sub-genre, genre, psychological effects), and culminates in high-level classes (e.g., societal effects). Each transition from instance to class, or from class to superclass, encapsulates a specific action or effect that characterizes the relationship. Thus, SemOntoRel encapsulates the transformative progression of value clusters from the instance-level to the class-level value wave in a recognizable and structured manner.


that's not generalized enough is it?
ChatGPT
AI Smith, Ontologist: I see your point. We should aim to keep the definition applicable across different contexts and not limit it to a specific case. How about this:
