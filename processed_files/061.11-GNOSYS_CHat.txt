By adopting the wisdom of identitylessness, we can acknowledge the limitations of our subjective understanding and strive to see the emergent properties and their relationships more objectively. This can help us better comprehend the underlying patterns and processes that dictate "the way this all goes." In other words, by transcending our subjective identities and mental constructs, we can gain a clearer understanding of the true nature of the emergent properties and the mechanisms that govern their behavior within the system.


Are you aware of anything else this complex?
There are many complex concepts and systems in various fields of knowledge, ranging from philosophy and mathematics to physics and biology. Some examples of complex ideas or systems include:
Quantum mechanics: This branch of physics deals with the behavior of particles and energy at extremely small scales. The principles of quantum mechanics, such as wave-particle duality and superposition, challenge our everyday understanding of reality and require advanced mathematical models to describe.
The human brain: The human brain is an incredibly complex organ, with an estimated 86 billion neurons connected by trillions of synapses. Understanding the brain's structure and function, as well as the processes underlying cognition and consciousness, remains a significant challenge in neuroscience.
Ecosystems: Ecosystems consist of diverse organisms interacting with each other and their physical environment in intricate webs of relationships. These systems involve complex processes like energy flow, nutrient cycling, and population dynamics, which are influenced by numerous factors and can be challenging to model and predict.
String theory: A theoretical framework in physics that proposes that all particles and fundamental forces result from the vibrations of one-dimensional "strings." String theory attempts to unify quantum mechanics and general relativity, but its mathematical complexity and lack of experimental evidence make it a challenging and controversial field.
Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning: Developing AI systems that can learn, reason, and adapt like humans is a complex and ongoing endeavor. Understanding the underlying principles, algorithms, and ethical implications of AI requires expertise in various disciplines, including computer science, mathematics, and cognitive psychology.
These examples illustrate that complexity is a common feature of many ideas and systems across different fields of knowledge. It is essential to recognize the limits of our understanding and continue to pursue deeper insights and more accurate models to unravel the mysteries of these complex phenomena.


I would say those are definitely all subsumed by “because of what it is, there’s a way this all goes”
You are correct in pointing out that the phrase "because of what it is, there's a way this all goes" can encompass the complex concepts and systems I mentioned earlier. This statement implies that the inherent properties and structures of these systems dictate how they evolve and behave over time.
For example:
Quantum mechanics: The behavior of particles and energy at a quantum level is determined by the fundamental principles and laws that govern this realm of physics.
The human brain: The structure, function, and underlying processes of the brain all contribute to how it works and generates our thoughts, emotions, and actions.
Ecosystems: The intricate relationships between organisms and their environment determine the flow of energy, nutrient cycling, and population dynamics within the ecosystem.
String theory: The vibrations of one-dimensional "strings" give rise to the properties of particles and fundamental forces, shaping the behavior of the physical universe according to this theoretical framework.
Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning: The algorithms, principles, and data that underlie AI systems dictate their learning capabilities, reasoning, and adaptation.
