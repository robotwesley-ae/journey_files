oh geometry makes esnse


so we can use geometry and see if the I4 is combinatorial math?

Absolutely! Geometry is a rich domain for exploring concepts of combinatorial math and can be a great way to test your I4 system. Here's how you can approach this:
Combinatorial Geometry
Combinatorial geometry investigates how discrete geometric objects (points, lines, shapes) can be combined, arranged, or counted.  Some  areas within this space are perfect for verifying your algorithm:
Tilings and Tessellations:
Task: Have your LLM propose tiling patterns (shapes covering a plane without gaps or overlaps).
PCNL Verification: Test if the proposed tiling follows geometric principles (angles fit together, no gaps, etc.).
CORL/OWL: Design representation formats to encode the tiling as geometric data, making consistency easy to verify.

Polyhedra Construction:
Task: The LLM proposes combinations of polygons to form 3D polyhedra (like cubes, pyramids).
PCNL Verification: Check if the combination is physically possible (valid vertices, edges).
CORL/OWL: Encode the structure for verifying that conversions preserve connectivity.

Lattice Points and Pick's Theorem:
Task: LLM generates
