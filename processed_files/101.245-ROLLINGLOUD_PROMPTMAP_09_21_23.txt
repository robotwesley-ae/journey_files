combine the following two scenes so that they're intercut with good pacing: EXT. ROLLING LOUD VENUE - NIGHT Using Linda's volunteer credentials to gain access and navigate the festival grounds, the trio encounters numerous boys passing by. LINDA Is that him? KEVIN No. LINDA Is that him? KEVIN No, Linda, that's not him. That's just another festival-goer. CHAD You think everyone is Zion. LINDA (defensively) They all kindaâ€™ look alike. Keving and Chad turn to Linda -- what!?????? LINDA Teenagers. Not black people! Gosh. (pointing) Is that him? KEVIN (squinting) Linda, that's a girl in a unicorn onesie. Definitely not Zion. LINDA I'm trying my best, okay? KEVIN Linda, we appreciate your enthusiasm, but let's stay focused. Linda confidently flashes her volunteer badge. As they navigate through the crowd, Kevin notices the curious stares and whispers from festival-goers. He can't help but feel a mix of excitement and unease. KEVIN I think people are starting to notice us. CHAD Don't worry, Kevin. We're on a mission, and we're going to find Zion. Let them wonder. SHENSEEA Singing... Singing.... Singing... EXT. FESTIVAL STAGE - ROLLING LOUD VENUE - NIGHT Shenseea performs "Be Good" on stage, captivating the crowd with her energy. She calls out to members to show off their twerking skills, hyping up the audience. SHENSEEA (to the crowd) Alright, who's got the best twerking skills out here? Show me what you got! The crowd goes wild, eager to impress Shenseea. She brings a LITTLE PERSON onto the stage, igniting even more excitement from the audience. SHENSEEA (pointing to the crowd) Alright, my friend here wants someone to join us on stage and dance! Pick someone, my friend! The energy in the air is electric. Kevin, high on cocaine, has a sudden idea. He turns to Chad and Linda, his eyes filled with determination. KEVIN If I can get on stage, maybe I can grab the microphone and make a shout-out to Zion! CHAD It's worth a try! With this newfound purpose, Kevin becomes more determined than ever to find a way onto the stage and reunite with his son. They start pushing through the crowd, facing a near-impossible task. CHAD (grunting) Man, this crowd is like a solid wall! How are we ever gonna get through? LINDA (angry) Chad, if you'd stop stepping on my toes, maybe we'd make some progress! Chad and Linda bicker and yell at each other incessantly, their banter adding to the chaos of the situation. It makes their progress slow and arduous. KEVIN (desperate) Guys, we need to focus! We're almost there! Finally, after what feels like an eternity, they reach the front where bouncers work tirelessly to control the crowd. The little person on stage spots Kevin and calls him up. LITTLE PERSON (excitedly) Hey, you! Get up here! Bouncers initially try to hold Kevin back, unsure about letting him on stage. But seeing that the little person has chosen him, they reluctantly assist Kevin, guiding him through the crowd as he stumbles onto the stage. KEVIN (out of breath) I... made it! The crowd cheers, unaware of the chaos unfolding in Kevin's personal life.
