Shenseea locks eyes with the BURLY BODYGUARDS, throwing them a playful grin. Their initially intense gaze on Kevin softens as they discern the 'gun' outline in his pocket.

BURLY BODYGUARD
(in a surprisingly high-pitched voice)
Sup?

Shenseea gives Kevin an encouraging nod.

KEVIN
(trying to sound confident)
Um...Sup? I think my son's inside.

The bodyguard eyes him up and down, then gestures towards a nearby water dunk tank.

BURLY BODYGUARD
(with a smirk)
You get a shot at dunking me, and if you succeed, you get in. Deal?

A moment of tension hangs in the air. The dunk tank, the bodyguards, the bus - all challenging Kevin's resolve. But with his son possibly on the other side of that bus door, there's no turning back. 

KEVIN
(determined)
Deal.

Rewrite the following in the style of Todd Phillips: INT. CARNIVAL GROUNDS - PLAYBUS - NIGHT KEVIN, SHENSEEA & KEESHALOO (sp?) creep closer to the ominous PLAYBUS. SHENSEEA (in a whisper) Look like you're packing. KEVIN (nervously) What? Why? SHENSEEA You wanna find your son? KEVIN Fine. Fine. As they edge closer to the entrance, Kevin's hand shifts into his pocket, shaping into a gun. SHENSEEA (smiling) Look crazy. Like you’ll kill someone. Shenseea makes eye contact with the BURLY BODYGUARDS, flashing a mischievous grin. Their gaze initially intense on Kevin softens as they take in the outline of his 'gun'. BURLY BODYGUARD (with a really high pitched voice/maybe from Kevin’s drugs?) Sup? Shenseea nods at Kevin, who is unsure what to do. KEVIN Um...Sup? I think my son’s inside there. The bodyguard’s giving Kevin nothing. Kevin pulls Shenseea and Keeshaloo (sp?) a few steps away, whispers. KEVIN It’s not working. SHENSEEA You gotta act confident. Like you got a gun and you ain’t afraid to use it. That’s the only way these guys respect you. Stop acting like a goddamn bitch and take control of your life. KEVIN You’re right. You’re right. With determination, Kevin turns around and gets straight in the BODYGUARD’S space... KEVIN Listen, mother fucker. I don’t know who you think you’re messing with-- The BODYGUARD instantly grabs Kevin and lifts him in the air, high above his head. KEVIN Ahhhhh! Let me down! Please? Help? I didn’t mean it!? Let me down. SHENSEEA (to the bouncer, smiles) Just let us go in, Ty. You can have your way with him later, whoever you want. KEVIN What!???? BURLY BODYGUARD Really? However I want? KEVIN No! SHENSEEA Yes. BURLY BODYGUARD Can I invite Big Mac & Lil’ M? KEVIN No! SHENSEEA Absolutely. Bodyguard drops Kevin with a THUD and allows them entry.

INT. CARNIVAL GROUNDS - PLAYBUS - NIGHT

KEVIN, SHENSEEA, and KEESHALOO creep ominously towards the towering PLAYBUS.

SHENSEEA
(whispering)
Look like you're packing.

KEVIN
(nervously)
What? Why?

SHENSEEA
You wanna find your son?

KEVIN
(resigned)
Fine. Fine.

As they sneak closer to the entrance, Kevin's hand dives into his pocket, shaping a pseudo-gun.

SHENSEEA
(grinning)
Look unhinged. Like you'd murder for fun.

Shenseea locks eyes with the BURLY BODYGUARDS, throwing them a playful, almost flirtatious smile. Their initially laser-focused stare at Kevin fades into a relaxed calm, taking in the 'gun' silhouette in his pocket.

BURLY BODYGUARD
(in a bizarrely high-pitched voice)
Sup?

Shenseea cues Kevin with a nod, who's floundering in his uncertainty.

KEVIN
(nervously)
Um...Sup? My kid... I think he's in there.

The bodyguard's expression is unreadable, stone-cold. Kevin pulls Shenseea and Keeshaloo away, whispering frantically.

KEVIN
It's not working.

SHENSEEA
You gotta show some spine. Pretend you got a gun and you're trigger-happy. That's the language these brutes understand. Stop whimpering like a lost puppy and take some damn control.

KEVIN
(resolute)
You're right. You're right.

Kevin whirls around, steely determination in his eyes. He invades the BODYGUARD's space.

KEVIN
(defiantly)
Listen here, dickhead. You've got no idea who you're--

In an instant, the BODYGUARD hoists Kevin up in the air, holding him high above his head.

KEVIN
(panic-stricken)
Ahhhh! Put me down! Please? Help? I didn't mean it!? Put me down.

SHENSEEA
(to the bodyguard, grinning)
