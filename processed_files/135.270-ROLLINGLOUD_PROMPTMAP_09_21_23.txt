KEVIN (trying to sound composed) Yeah, it's just one of those immersive experiences, you know? Like being transported into a whole different world.
MELANIE (V.O.) I see. And what about Zion? How's he doing?
Kevin's grip tightens on the phone as he tries to maintain his composure.
KEVIN (confidently) Zion is having a fantastic time. He's making new friends and enjoying all the attractions.
MELANIE (V.O.) That's good to hear. Tell me more about it.
Kevin's attention is divided. In the background, Chad and Linda make inappropriate comments, adding to the chaos, while the girls continue their flirtatious behavior.
CHAD (rude comment, interrupting) Hey Linda, I think they need you over at the cockblock section!
LINDA (calling out to the girls) Chadâ€™s missing his penis head!
Kevin tries to steer the conversation away from the distractions.
KEVIN (trying to sound enthusiastic) It's amazing, honey! They have these incredible rides, delicious food, and the atmosphere is electrifying. I wish you could be here to experience it with us.
MELANIE (V.O.) I wish I could too, Kevin. It sounds like a memorable time. Just make sure to take care of Zion and yourselves, okay?
KEVIN (reassuringly) Of course, Mel. We're having a blast, and I'm keeping a close eye on Zion. Safety is our top priority.
MELANIE (V.O.) That's good to hear. Enjoy the rest of the movie and give Zion a big hug for me.
KEVIN (emotionally) I will, Mel. Love you.
Kevin ends the call, feeling a mix of relief and guilt. The girls' flirtatious behavior and inappropriate comments continue in the background, but Kevin's attention is drawn to his phone as it lights up with notifications from Zion's Snapchat account.
He frantically opens the app, scrolling through the messages until he finds a picture of Zion jumping alongside a large crowd.
KEVIN (relieved, mumbling to himself) Zion! Look, it's Zion!
Excitedly, he shows the picture to Chad and Linda, hoping they can decipher the location.
LINDA (excitedly) I know which stage that is! I recognize that banner hanging from the stage. It's part of the volunteer setup!
