Interface for kanban = github + github visualizer on frontend

==== Allows me to manage all my tasks on Github from the Orchestrator

Collate UCO_1 and UCO_2 convos
Check state of total UCO pipeline status

Integrate UCO with OMNISANC

==== Allows me to construct any chains in a uniform formalized way and use ontologies, RDF, OWL, etc via PCNL CORL pipeline

Integrate Poimandres with Taskdaemon from UCO OMNISANC

==== Allows complex decomposition and AI or Human task disambiguation

Integrate UCO OMNISANC with files, embeddings, and DBs for Zettelkasten for my_docs
Create ZkBrainBrane

==== Allows all unstructured docs to be ZK’d and engineered into ontologies via GDS on neo4j

Upload all my_docs to ZkBrainBrane pipeline
Convert my_docs to ZkDB and ProjectBrainBrane
Procreate ProjectTypeBrainBranes from Projects from ZkDB
Procreate ProjectInstancingBrainBranes from ProjectTypeBrainBranes for Projects from ZkDB

==== Allows all projects from ontologies to be executed by AI and disambiguated to human tasks, meaning AI can continually execute tasks and is only blocked by the human

Optimizer
==== Allows use of scientific method and complex optimization using BrainBrane and AutoProcreate and UCO ChainConstructor etc.

==== Allows creation, simulation, and deployment of complex production applications from NL
==== Allows creation of Sanctuary ontologies, Sanctuary Nexus, SANCTUM, and Crystal Ball





NATURAL LANGUAGE PROGRAMMING, TRANSFER LEARNING

Sanctuary Funnel:

Read “The Sanctuary System”
Read “Level10+”
Read “Going to Sanctuary”
What is your Sanctuary? The world in which you would never stop playing your own “game” with the world, no matter how offensive, stupid, horrible, terrifying, lovely, etc it got?
