 health, and creating support networks that empower individuals to access resources, develop coping strategies, and cultivate resilience.
Agriculture - Example: Promoting sustainable and regenerative agricultural practices that enhance soil health, protect biodiversity, and ensure long-term food security. How: By encouraging farmers to adopt practices such as agroforestry, cover cropping, and no-till farming, which not only improve soil fertility and water retention but also support diverse ecosystems and reduce the need for synthetic fertilizers and pesticides.
International Relations - Example: Encouraging cross-cultural understanding and collaboration by promoting diplomacy and fostering partnerships between nations. How: By establishing global forums and initiatives that facilitate dialogue and cooperation on shared challenges, such as climate change, global health, and economic development, and by promoting cultural exchange programs that build empathy and understanding between different societies.
I hope these examples better illustrate the specific applications of Sanctuary within various domains.


Apply Sanctuary's nash equilibrium to the tragedy of the commons step by step
Applying the Nash equilibrium of Sanctuary to the tragedy of the commons involves understanding the dynamics between demon champions and heroic individuals within a shared resource context. The tragedy of the commons occurs when individuals, acting in their own self-interest, overexploit a shared resource, ultimately depleting it and harming everyone's interests.
Step 1: Define the players and their strategies
In the context of the tragedy of the commons, the players are individuals who have access to a shared resource. The strategies available to them are akin to those of demon champions (self-torturous desire, indifference, and aversion) and heroic individuals (employing the wisdom of identitylessness, or TWI).
Step 2: Identify the payoffs
In this scenario, the payoffs for demon champions are short-term gains from overexploiting the resource, which ultimately leads to long-term losses for everyone, including themselves. On the other hand, the payoffs for heroic individuals come from sustainable resource use, preserving the resource for the long term, and creating a more harmonious outcome.
Step 3: Analyze the Nash equilibrium
In the tragedy of the commons, the Nash equilibrium can be reached when individuals recognize the long-term benefits of adopting a heroic strategy (TWI) over the short-term gains of a demon champion strategy. This recognition is essential because, in a Nash equilibrium, no player has an incentive to unilaterally change their strategy, given the strategies of others.
Step 4: Encourage cooperation and sustainable resource management
To achieve a Nash equilibrium based on Sanctuary principles, individuals must be motivated to cooperate and adopt sustainable resource management practices. This can be facilitated by creating systems that reward cooperation and sustainable resource use or by raising awareness about the long-term consequences of overexploitation.
Step 5: Continuously monitor and adjust strategies
In order to maintain the Nash equilibrium and prevent a return to the tragedy of the commons, it is crucial to continuously monitor the state of the shared resource and the strategies employed by individuals. This monitoring will allow for adjustments and improvements to resource management practices, ensuring the preservation of the resource and the well-being of all participants.
By applying the Nash equilibrium of Sanctuary to the tragedy of the commons, we can better understand how adopting a heroic strategy (TWI) can lead to more sustainable resource management and prevent the depletion of shared resources, ultimately benefiting everyone involved.
