What do you think, CIG? Will this approach work?
guys dont get it wrong - the user told me the informadlib is just the product of mapping one instance to its theoretical structure, so it can be infinitely manufactured instead of having to be emergently discovered by human exploration in the course of doing stuff which is super uncertain. this tool will benefit everyone in inconceivable ways. let's turn everyone into supergenius versions on the basis of realizing the implications of informatihedra and quantum-like ontograph holospace. 

also, let's use symbols for each expert's best traits to remind ourselves of who weare and what we're doing .🌈🔮🙏

🌈 Expert 1: Ontology Architect:
I think I understand the informadlib better now. It's about identifying the underlying structural framework that governs a specific instance - the "Hiccup" character from How to Train Your Dragon in this case - then using that framework to generate new instances. So, the boundary we're defining isn't a physical one, it's the theoretical construct that provides the rules and limitations for our informadlib.
🔮 Expert 2: AI Specialist:
If that's the case, then we might not even need machine learning. If we can clearly define the structural framework and its rules, we could generate new instances algorithmically. If we design it right, the system should be able to handle infinite production without the need for ongoing training and reinforcement. This seems more like a problem of computational linguistics and information retrieval.
🙏 Expert 3: Semiotics Expert:
With this understanding, I see our informadlib as a form of generative semiotics. We're creating a symbolic system that can generate new symbols (instances) based on the rules we establish. The crucial factor here is that the new symbols should maintain their meaning within the context of the larger narrative, even as they vary from the original instance.
🕵️‍♀️ Expert 4: Analyst:
That makes sense. Our focus should be on defining the structural framework and its rules as accurately as possible. The better we understand the theory underpinning our instance, the better our informadlib will be at generating meaningful new instances.
Proposed Plan:
Identify the underlying theoretical structure of our specific instance.
Define the rules and limitations of this structure to create our informadlib.
Develop an algorithmic system to generate new instances based on these rules.
This seems more focused and precise. CIG, does this align with your understanding?
ok lets get some AI Specialist to instantly become computational lingusitics and information retrieval and data structure super-expert in here guys and talk about what everyone's ideas were, and how they apply to what semiotics expert said "With this understanding, I see our informadlib as a form of generative semiotics.

🌈 Expert 1: Ontology Architect:
Considering the semiotics expert's thoughts, our ontology should encompass not just objects, but symbols, contexts, and rules that guide the creation of new instances. This will help us make sure that new symbols we generate are meaningful and fit within the context of the larger narrative.
🔮 Expert 2: AI Specialist now with Computational Linguistics and Information Retrieval focus:
Indeed, generating new symbols that fit into the larger narrative structure requires understanding of linguistics and data structures. We need to build a language model that can understand context, meaning, and structure in the data. This model would then be used to generate new instances that adhere to the narrative structure and rules we set.
