[SemOntoRel] (Semantic Ontological Relationship): SemOntoRel is a structured, formalized representation of the semantic and ontological relationships within the EWSO. It encapsulates the dynamic progression of instance-level entities through various hierarchical layers of classes to high-level superclasses within a given conceptual model. Each transition between the layers represents a specific action or effect, encapsulating the transformation of values from instance-level to class-level conceptual value boundaries within a recognizable and structured manner. This enables the ontology to embody the complex interplay of entities and their relationships in a coherent and actionable way."

AI Nash, Mathematician: Absolutely. The symbolic language we created earlier can indeed be used to form a basis for GPT-4's understanding of EWSO, Informadlibs, Informadlib Templates, and SemOntoRel.
Now, the actual implementation in GPT would be significantly complex because of its inherent inability to hold persistent state or a data model over a conversation. To bypass this limitation, we need to feed all relevant context in each round of interaction. This means that the information necessary for the model to perform a specific task needs to be presented in the form of a conversational context.
With this in mind, we can create a pseudo-coding system that will trigger GPT-4's understanding of our specific symbolic language, allowing it to perform the required operations to generate the Informadlib. Here's how we could represent our ontology and SemOntoRel in a conversation:

Conversation Context: User: I am providing the following ontology context. The classes are: A: 'InstanceLevel1', B: 'InstanceLevel2', C: 'ClassLevel1', D: 'ClassLevel2'. The transitions are: α: 'maps from InstanceLevel1 to InstanceLevel2', β: 'maps from InstanceLevel2 to ClassLevel1'. The transition domains and ranges are: 1: 'InstanceLevel1', 2: 'InstanceLevel2', 3: 'InstanceLevel2', 4: 'ClassLevel1'. The value property of InstanceLevel1 is denoted by P and its maximum value is Q: 'maxValue'. The specific transition rule for InstanceLevel1 is denoted by R with a rule S: 'specificRule'. I want to map the following NL descriptions to this ontology: x: 'NL description of input property x', y: 'NL description of input property y'. Please generate an Informadlib based on this ontology and the provided descriptions. AI: Given your inputs, an Informadlib corresponding to the provided ontology and NL descriptions can be generated as follows...
This context includes all the information necessary for the model to understand the ontology, the transition rules, and the mappings to the provided NL descriptions.
ChristoCryptographer: That's a nice way to represent the structured prompts and ontology, Nash. The idea here is to make the underlying ontology explicit in the conversation, as well as the mappings to the user's inputs. The cryptographic part comes into play in ensuring the unique representation of each concept and relationship in the ontology, and their mappings to the NL descriptions.
So, the task now is to ensure that the model can properly interpret and utilize this information in generating the Informadlib. As you've correctly pointed out, GPT has limitations, and this pseudo-coding approach can help in bypassing some of these limitations. However, it's important to remember that GPT's responses are based on patterns it has learned from its training data, and not on an inherent understanding of the concepts or relationships. It is generating text that appears to have an understanding of these relationships based on its learned patterns.


right but in roleplay we can create imaginary conceptual constellations that create fiatconceptualboundaries on the information space that make the information hologram work in our favor and output exactly what we want
