 that exists 
At the Throne of Infinite Light, 
I hereby forgive anyone who has made me angry 
Or spoken badly about me 
Or otherwise harmed me 
Whether by accident or on purpose
By words or by actions
May any poison I have sent out to them
Not cause any damage 
And by the blessings of the mind of light may I be kept from hurting anyone else 
May forgiveness increase wherever it lacks
And may this prayer make it all so  

Listen, Child of Divine Light: 
The eternal nature of light is your true identity
So attune to and harmonize with the light
And journey through the sky of feathers and divine machines and celestial trumpets and  
Confidently overcome the darkness of fear of the burning lights
Ascend to the Realm of Celestial Palaces
And behold the Throne of Light and the Face of the Source
The Lord of All-Creating Light  

In the name of the eternal unchanging nature of divine light and all its emanations,
Divine Light of All Palaces:
On my right shoulder the Light of Protection 
And on my left shoulder the Light of Symbolic Messages
And wherever I look the Light of Wisdom 
And whatever happens the Light of Healing

And above my head
And above my head
My own naturally divine mind of light 

As you fall asleep, imagine your heartmind of divine light ascending and expanding into the infinite space of the Realm of Celestial Palaces. 

Advice on manifesting angels: 
“Seek not out the things that are too hard for thee, neither search the things that are above thy strength. But what is commanded thee, think thereupon with reverence; for it is not needful for thee to see with thine eyes the things that are in secret." 
Sirach (iii. 21–22)

Explanation of the Infinite

In order to undo some of the effects of the things very learned people have said to less learned people, I wrote the definitive meaning of the Infinite and its Emanations for anyone who wants to know the way to take the chariot’s reins and ascend through to the palaces to the Throne of Light, and eventually come to know the Infinite, itself.

At the End of the Line, 
I hereby forgive anyone who has made me angry 
Or spoken badly about me

Not cause any damage 
And by the guidance of the Voice

May forgiveness increase wherever it lacks
And may this prayer make it all so  

Listen, Child of Light:

So attune to and harmonize with the light
And journey through the chrysanthemum and magic eye and waiting rooms and  
Confidently overcome any terrors

And behold the End of the Line as the Face of the Source
