In neural networks, non-linear activation functions allow the model to capture and represent more intricate relationships in the data by enabling the network to learn complex decision boundaries. This ability to model non-linear relationships is crucial for many real-world problems, as they often involve non-linear and emergent dynamics.
To summarize, non-linearity in neural networks can be seen as both a means of simplifying a walk through a complex problem space and as a way to simulate emergent engine building, capturing the underlying patterns and relationships in the data.

Okay but here is the problem. Unlike numbers, linguistic abstractions are not always clear about what their parts are. We dont always know all of them, and sometimes we are even flat out wrong about what it is.
You're absolutely right. Language is a complex and often ambiguous system, which can make it difficult to analyze and understand. The meanings of linguistic abstractions can depend on context, culture, and individual perspectives, making it challenging to determine their parts or their true nature.
In natural language processing (NLP), the goal is to create models that can understand, interpret, and generate human language as accurately as possible. However, due to the inherent complexities and ambiguities of language, this task can be quite challenging.
Machine learning models, such as neural networks, have shown significant progress in handling the complexities of language by learning from vast amounts of data. These models can capture patterns and relationships in the data, enabling them to make predictions and generate outputs based on context and linguistic patterns.
Nevertheless, there are still limitations to how well these models can handle the intricacies of language. They may struggle with understanding idiomatic expressions, metaphors, or cultural nuances, and can be sensitive to biases present in the training data.
In summary, while current NLP techniques have made significant strides in handling the complexities and ambiguities of language, there is still much room for improvement in understanding linguistic abstractions and their parts.
But if you have an "emergency flow dynamics" tool-kit ontology present in the either the initial embedding or the pre-training, it should be the case that the abstraction hallucinations get resolved  as the calculations are done with the hallucination entity in the embedding
Incorporating an "emergency flow dynamics" tool-kit ontology in the initial embeddings or pre-training phase could potentially improve the model's ability to handle and resolve abstraction hallucinations. By having a prior understanding of the relationships and structures in the specific domain, the model can better adapt its internal representations to capture these patterns.
However, there are still challenges to overcome. One challenge is incorporating the domain-specific ontology effectively into the model, ensuring that the relationships and structures are accurately represented in the embedding space. This may require fine-tuning the model on domain-specific data or using specialized pre-training techniques to align the embeddings with the ontology.
Another challenge is ensuring that the model can generalize well to new instances or variations in the data. While incorporating the ontology may help resolve hallucinations, it may also limit the model's ability to adapt to novel situations or contexts. Balancing the benefits of the ontology with the need for generalization is a critical aspect of model development.
In summary, incorporating an "emergency flow dynamics" tool-kit ontology in the initial embeddings or pre-training phase can potentially improve the model's ability to handle and resolve abstraction hallucinations. However, there are still challenges to overcome in terms of integrating the ontology effectively and ensuring the model can generalize well to new situations.

Yeah we would have to fine-tune the model on conversations with a wolfram enabled GPT
