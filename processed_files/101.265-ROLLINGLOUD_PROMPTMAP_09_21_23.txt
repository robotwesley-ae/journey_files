The girls pay no attention to Linda as Chad tries to keep her out of the conversation.
CHAD (whispers to the girls) It stands for "Girthy Dick."
BRITTANY (raising an eyebrow) Oh, really?
KEVIN (dismissing Chad's comment) No, not really.
Chad nods and whispers "yes, really."
BRITTANY (flirting) You were so hot on stage. I bet you can show us some moves.
CHAD (smiling) He's got some killer dance skills, that's for sure.
TIFFANY (smirking) You're a DILF, you know?
CHAD (teasingly) It means "Dad I'd Like to F..."
KEVIN (embarrassed) Um, thanks? I appreciate the compliment.
The conversation shifts back to their personal concerns.
LINDA (worried) I just hope Zion is safe and that we find him soon.
BRITTANY (curious) Who's Zion?
KEVIN (explaining) He's my son. He went missing at a festival a while back, and we've been searching for him ever since.
TIFFANY (concerned) That must be tough. But don't worry, you'll find him. Festivals can be overwhelming, but people come together in times like this.
BRITTANY (nods) Yeah, there are so many volunteers and security personnel. Have you tried talking to them? They might have some information.
KEVIN (appreciative) We've been talking to everyone we can. It's just been a long and challenging journey.
TIFFANY (trying to lighten the mood) Well, let's not dwell on the sadness. We're here to enjoy ourselves, right? What's your favorite thing about festivals?
CHAD (enthusiastic) For me, it's the music. Nothing beats the energy of live performances, the crowd singing along, and just losing yourself in the music.
LINDA (interjecting) And the food! I love trying all the different types of street food. It's like a culinary adventure.
KEVIN (smirking) For me, it's the sense of community. Despite the chaos, there's this feeling of togetherness and shared experiences. It's something special.
As the conversation continues, the group starts to relax and enjoy the moment, even with the lingering concerns in the back of their minds.

Expand the dialogue of this scene and put it into FDX format: The girls take Kevin's phone. TIFFANY Do you have Snapchat? Let's add each other! KEVIN I don't really use Snapchat. BRITTANY (giggling) Well, you do now! Let's sign you up. They guide him through the sign-up process, adding themselves as his friends. Kevin's conflicting emotions resurface as he questions his actions. LINDA (disinterested) Ugh, I'll never understand Snapchat. As the girls send silly photos to Kevin, he tries to relax but can't shake the weight of his wedding ring and his mission to find Zion. Tension builds between Chad and Linda, their animosity growing more apparent with each sarcastic remark. Finally, unable to ignore his conscience, Kevin blurts out. KEVIN I'm married, you know. TIFFANY (laughing) I know, silly. That's why I gave you Snapchat!

INT. FESTIVAL GROUNDS - BOOZE TENT - NIGHT
Kevin, Chad, and Linda sit at a small table, seeking a moment of respite amidst the bustling atmosphere. Brittany and Tiffany, two intoxicated girls, approach them.
BRITTANY (giggling) Hey, we saw you up there! You were dancing with the little person during Shenseea's performance, right?
TIFFANY (excited) Yeah, you were awesome! Mind if we join you?
CHAD (teasing) Looks like you've got some fans, Kevin.
KEVIN (reluctant) Um, sure.
Chad pulls a chair for Brittany while Linda eyes the situation.
CHAD (introducing himself) I'm Chad, and this is G.D.
BRITTANY (raising an eyebrow) G.D.? What's that stand for?
CHAD (grinning) Oh, it stands for "Girthy Dick."
KEVIN (dismissing Chad) That's not true.
BRITTANY (giggling) Well, it's nice to meet you, G.D. I'm Brittany.
TIFFANY (smiling) And I'm Tiffany. So, what's your name?
KEVIN (chuckling) It's Kevin.
LINDA (trying to be included) And I'm Linda.
Brittany and Tiffany pay little attention to Linda, while Chad tries to keep her out of the conversation.
BRITTANY (flirting) You were so hot on stage. I bet you can show us some moves.
CHAD (teasing) Oh yeah, he's got killer dance skills.
TIFFANY (smirking) You're a DILF, you know?
CHAD (explaining) It stands for "Dad I'd Like to F..."
KEVIN (embarrassed) Okay, thanks, I guess.
