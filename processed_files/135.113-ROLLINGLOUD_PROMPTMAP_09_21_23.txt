MELANIE What kind of stuff do you get tagged in?
Offscreen, Linda groans from discomfort. Chad gags. Kevin quickly tries to divert the conversation.
KEVIN Furniture. Yeah, I get a lot of tags from the furniture community.
Melanie, puzzled, relays Kevin's explanation to Cindy’s Mom.
MELANIE Kevin says it's algorithm stuff.
Meanwhile, Linda groans louder.
KEVIN Don't worry. Everything is under control. I gotta go. Love you, bye!
As he ends the call, Linda's voice trails off in the background.
LINDA You guys used all the toile--
Kevin quickly hangs up, breathing a sigh of relief.
KEVIN Oh, shit.
He pulls up the post in which Zion is tagged.
KEVIN I think he's with Playboi Carti.
In his panic, Kevin tries to open the door, only to find it jammed shut.
check the following: INT. PLAYBUS - CONTINUOUS The PLAYBUS is a pulsating haze. Marijuana mist swirls (the bus has been rigged to be a giant hotbox) KEVIN, SHENSEEA, and KEESHALOO push through the bodies towards PLAYBOI CARTI, engrossed in his track. KEVIN (nervously) Uh, hello, Mr. Carti. My name's Kevin. I'm... a big fan of yours. Carti raises an eyebrow, his curiosity piqued yet skeptical. PLAYBOI CARTI Oh, really? So, what's your favorite track of mine? KEVIN (immediately) Sky. It's Sky. Carti looks surprised, a grin spreading across his face. PLAYBOI CARTI (leans back, crossing arms) Alright then, let's hear it. KEVIN You want to hear it? Like play it on an iphone? PLAYBOI CARTI I want you to sing your favorite song if you’re such a big fan. Heart pounding, Kevin takes a deep breath and launches into the first verse of "Sky", his voice shaky yet sincere. KEVIN (singing, unsteady) I told my boy go on, like ten flats on the fifty-yard...Yeah, yeah, off the fifty, yeah, yeah... A chorus of laughter erupts, but Kevin pushes through, refusing to back down. PLAYBOI CARTI (laughs) Nah, man. You ain't a fan. Faced with Carti's disbelief, Kevin comes clean, his words rushing out in a desperate confession. KEVIN (determined) You're right. I'm not a fan, not really. I actually don’t love your music, but I love my son and he loves your music, so I brought him to Rolling Loud thinking we’d watch you perform tonight and I secretly learned all the words to Sky, because I thought I’d surprise him, but now I lost him. And someone mentioned he might have come looking for you, for a photo... The laughter dies down. Carti's amusement fades. PLAYBOI CARTI What's your son look like? KEVIN Let me show you... Kevin pulls out his phone to find a photo of Zion, but accidentally opens a risqué text from earlier. PLAYBOI CARTI (laughs) Damn, Kev. Flustered, Kevin quickly scrolls past the photo. KEVIN (mumbling) That's, um, not... Playboi Carti gives a nod of understanding. PLAYBOI CARTI I get it. He finds a picture of Zion and shows Carti. INSERT SHOT - A PHOTO OF KEVIN AND A YOUNGER ZION. KEVIN That's Zion... Carti shakes his head. PLAYBOI CARTI No Zion here, man. Kevin's heart plummets. His plan has failed. His phone rings - the caller ID shows "MELANIE - WIFE". KEVIN (muttering) Can't do this now, Mel... He moves to decline the call. PLAYBOI CARTI Always answer the wife, Kev. Kevin sighs and answers the call. KEVIN (low, kind of embarrassed) Hey honey. MELANIE Hey, how’s everything going? KEVIN Good! We’re just here watching a mvoie. Zi is pretty knackered I think he dozed off. I did for a little too. The movie is so loud though, it woke me up. How’s the party? CARTI (whispering) Tell her you love her hot ass. KEVIN (waving Carti off) What’s up? MELANIE Sorry to wake you. I miss you guys is all. This birthday dinner was kind of a drag, everybody just talked about their problems the whole time. KEVIN I love you hot ass. MELANIE What? KEVIN I said, I wish you were here. MELANIE Me too. I’m gonna leave this thing now I think. Night. KEVIN Night. Kevin's heart sinks, his hopes shattered.
