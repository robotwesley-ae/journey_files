Define a function H: A × R → {0, 1}, where H(a, r) = F(a, r) or G(a), meaning that for a rule r and an actor a, either the actor follows the rule, or the actor is rehabilitated after breaking the rule.
The Sanctuary system S is non-contradictory if ∀a ∈ A, ∀r ∈ R, H(a, r) = 1. In other words, in a non-contradictory Sanctuary system, each actor either follows the rules or is successfully rehabilitated after breaking the rules, thereby ensuring the stability and integrity of the system.
To understand the formalization and the relevant background information, let's first review the key concepts and ideas discussed previously:
Non-contradictory Sanctuary system (NCSS): This is a theoretical system in which rule-following and rule-breaking behaviors are in equilibrium, such that the stability and integrity of the system are maintained.
Nash Equilibrium (NE): A concept from game theory, which refers to a stable state of a system involving multiple decision-makers (players), where no player can gain an advantage by unilaterally changing their strategy, given that other players' strategies remain the same.
Sanctuary state (SS): A state in which refuge is granted to all living beings inside a system, and rule-breakers are rehabilitated and reintegrated into the system.
Rule breakers (RB) and rule followers (RF): Actors within the system who either follow the established rules or attempt to break them.
The formalization builds upon these concepts and attempts to define a NCSS in terms of rule-following and rule-breaking behaviors, as well as the rehabilitation process. The key idea is that in a NCSS, rule breakers are either transformed into rule followers or rehabilitated in a way that doesn't harm the stability of the system.
The formalization introduces several functions to describe the relationship between actors, rules, and the system:
Function F: Describes whether an actor follows or breaks a rule.
Function G: Indicates if an actor is rehabilitated after breaking a rule.
Function H: Combines the outcomes of functions F and G, representing the system's response to an actor's behavior.
By defining these functions, the formalization establishes the conditions necessary for a non-contradictory Sanctuary system, in which all actors either follow the rules or are rehabilitated after breaking them. This ensures the system's stability and integrity while allowing for the possibility of rule-breaking behaviors and their consequences.

Your formulation indeed provides a mathematical representation of a Sanctuary system where rules are either followed or broken and actors are either rehabilitated or not.
The function F(a, r) represents whether a given actor a follows a given rule r. If the actor follows the rule, the function returns 1, otherwise, it returns 0, indicating rule-breaking behavior.
The function G(a) symbolizes the rehabilitation process of an actor a. If the actor is successfully rehabilitated after breaking a rule, the function returns 1; if not, it returns 0.
The function H(a, r), representing the overall system response, is defined as the logical OR of functions F and G for each actor a and rule r. Therefore, H(a, r) = 1 if either the actor follows the rule or if they are rehabilitated after breaking the rule.
The Sanctuary system is defined as non-contradictory if, for every actor and every rule, H(a, r) = 1. This stipulation ensures the stability and integrity of the system by requiring that each actor either follows the rules or is successfully rehabilitated after breaking them.
This formulation essentially models the Sanctuary system as a sort of game where the actors have two strategies (follow or break rules) and the system has two responses (allow or rehabilitate). The non-contradictory Sanctuary system could be thought of as a desired equilibrium state of this game, where the actors' strategies and the system's responses work in harmony to maintain stability.
The rehabilitation process (as defined by G(a)) is critical here, as it provides a mechanism for the system to respond to and correct rule-breaking behavior, ensuring the rules' effectiveness and the system's ongoing integrity.
