As the Ferris wheel halts at the next pod, Kevin, with newfound determination, leaps first, landing safely.
KEVIN (pointing to the teddy bear's pod) One pod at a time, we can make it!
Chad, following Kevinâ€™s lead, readies himself.
CHAD (intensely) Wherever you go, I go!
Before Chad can make the jump, Linda impulsively leaps but misjudges the distance. She's now caught between two pods, her fingers slipping.
Near Mishap:
Kevin and Chad, without hesitation, grab Linda's arms and legs, respectively, creating a human chain. With collective effort, they pull Linda into the pod with them. The Ferris wheel jolts as it moves to the next stop.
CHAD (breathing heavily) Okay, that was too close...
LINDA (whispering) Thank you, both of you.
As the Ferris wheel halts again, they're finally at the teddy bear's pod. Kevin quickly negotiates with the occupants, pointing towards the ground and their urgent situation.
KEVIN (hurriedly) I need this bear. Here's some cash. Please?
With the giant teddy bear secured under his arm, Kevin assesses the height they still need to cover.
KEVIN (resolutely) One last jump. We got this.
The Teddy Bear Stunt:
Using the stops to their advantage, Kevin jumps off from the next pod, teddy bear beneath him. He lands with a soft thud, the bear absorbing the impact.
As the Ferris wheel stops again, Chad and Linda make their respective jumps, each using their own creative methods, including inflatable festival props spotted in pods.
Ground Reality:
All three of them, winded but intact, regroup on the ground. Kevin still holds onto the teddy bear, Chad's attire has remnants of festival decorations, and Linda, though shaken, manages a weak smile.
KEVIN (laughing) This is one for the books!
LINDA (looking up at the Ferris wheel) And hopefully the last time I ever do that!
CHAD (grinning) Rolling Loud 2024, unforgettable!
They all laugh, wrapping their arms around each other, their bond stronger than ever.
FADE OUT.
