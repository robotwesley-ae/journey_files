[SemOntoRel] (Semantic Ontological Relationship): SemOntoRel is a structured, formalized representation of the semantic and ontological relationships within the EWSO. It encapsulates the dynamic progression of instance-level entities through various hierarchical layers of classes to high-level superclasses within a given conceptual model. Each transition between the layers represents a specific action or effect, encapsulating the transformation of values from instance-level to class-level conceptual value boundaries within a recognizable and structured manner. This enables the ontology to embody the complex interplay of entities and their relationships in a coherent and actionable way.""
"Conversation Context:

User as Ontology Creator: I am establishing an ontology with the following classes and transitions: A: 'InstanceLevel1', B: 'InstanceLevel2', C: 'ClassLevel1', D: 'ClassLevel2', α: 'maps from InstanceLevel1 to InstanceLevel2', β: 'maps from InstanceLevel2 to ClassLevel1'. The transition domains and ranges are: 1: 'InstanceLevel1', 2: 'InstanceLevel2', 3: 'InstanceLevel2', 4: 'ClassLevel1'. The value property of InstanceLevel1 is denoted by P and its maximum value is Q: 'maxValue'. The specific transition rule for InstanceLevel1 is denoted by R with a rule S: 'specificRule'. I now provide the following NL descriptions: x: 'NL description of input property x', y: 'NL description of input property y'.

User as Informadlib Generator: Given the above ontology and descriptions, please generate the corresponding Informadlib.

AI as Informadlib Generator: Given your inputs, an Informadlib corresponding to the provided ontology and NL descriptions can be generated as follows..."

Understood. Here are the detailed steps:
Initialize an empty Informadlib.
Extract the details from the EWSO to identify the classes, subclasses, relationships, and their properties.
In the Informadlib, create a placeholder for each identified class and subclass.
In the Informadlib, assign an identifier for each class, subclass, and relationship as defined by the EWSO.
For each identified property, extract its corresponding value from the EWSO and map it to its associated class or subclass within the Informadlib.
Map the relationships between classes and subclasses in the EWSO to their corresponding parts in the Informadlib.
Create the Semantic Ontological Relationship (SemOntoRel) as per the EWSO. Assign identifiers for every instance and class-level conceptual boundaries.
Check for specific transition rules denoted by 'R'. If found, apply them to the associated entities in the Informadlib.
Validate the value property 'P' of InstanceLevel1 to ensure it does not exceed its maximum value 'Q'. If it does, adjust it to meet this limit.
