Apply the Nash equilibrium to Sanctuary principles: The Nash equilibrium can help guide the principles and actions within Sanctuary by promoting cooperation and harmony among heroic individuals while mitigating the negative effects of demon champions. Encourage heroic individuals to adopt cooperative strategies that lead to mutually beneficial outcomes and discourage demon champions from engaging in destructive behaviors.
Monitor and adjust: Continuously evaluate the effectiveness of the chosen strategies and the resulting Nash equilibrium in promoting the principles of Sanctuary. Make adjustments as needed to ensure that the equilibrium remains stable and beneficial to all players, especially heroic individuals who contribute positively to the community.
By understanding and applying the concept of Nash equilibrium to the evolutionary heroic game of play, we can promote an environment where heroic individuals thrive and contribute to a compassionate, empathetic, and harmonious community, while minimizing the impact of demon champions.


Right so a demon champion’s strategy is called self-torturous desire, indifference, and aversion. The heroic individual strategy is called the wisdom of identitylessness (TWI).
Considering these specific strategies for demon champions and heroic individuals, we can adjust the explanation accordingly:
Define the players and their strategies: In this context, the players are demon champions and heroic individuals. Demon champions adopt strategies of self-torturous desire, indifference, and aversion, while heroic individuals employ the strategy of the wisdom of identitylessness (TWI).
Determine the payoffs for each strategy combination: Payoffs in this game can be related to personal growth, well-being, and collective harmony for heroic individuals, and power, control, or dominance for demon champions. Calculate the payoffs for each combination of strategies, considering the unique context of the game and the players involved.
Identify the Nash equilibrium: Analyze the payoff matrix to identify the Nash equilibrium, which is the combination of strategies where no player has an incentive to change their strategy, given the strategies chosen by the others. In this case, a Nash equilibrium might involve the prevalence of the wisdom of identitylessness (TWI) among heroic individuals, limiting the negative effects of the demon champions' strategies.

By understanding and applying the concept of Nash equilibrium to this specific game, we can foster an environment where heroic individuals thrive and contribute to a compassionate, empathetic, and harmonious community, while minimizing the impact of demon champions and their self-torturous desire, indifference, and aversion strategies.


Right so because people can’t change who they are if they are demon champions (without destroying themselves), because all demon champions do is proliferate the wasteland which makes the Sanctuary more wrathful towards them and pushes the demons out causing Sanctuary; and heroic individuals can’t change their strategy becaus TWI is maximally loving and proliferating Sanctuary, isn’t that the Nash equilibrium?
