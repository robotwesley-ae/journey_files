INT. ARTISTS-ONLY AREA - CONTINUOUS
Shenseea leans in closer, brushing her hand against Kevin's arm, creating a tingling sensation.
SHENSEEA And what's your name?
KEVIN (stammering) Uh, yeah, it's Kevin.
Shenseea repeats his name, savoring each syllable.
SHENSEEA (seductively) Kevin... I like it.
Kevin's mind races with possibilities, but his focus quickly shifts when he feels a sharp pain in his back. He instinctively turns around, only to find himself locked in a tight grip by Keeshlinoo, the little person he inadvertently crushed earlier. Keeshlinoo's legs are wrapped around his head, while her punches rain down on him.
KEVIN (doing his best to speak through the struggle) What... the... hell!
SHENSEEA (alert, intervening) Hey, hey! Calm down!
Shenseea swiftly steps in, attempting to separate Kevin and Keeshlinoo.
SHENSEEA (urgent) Keeshlinoo, stop! Let him go!
Keeshlinoo releases her hold on Kevin, a mixture of anger and frustration etched on her face. She backs away, eyeing Kevin with a fierce intensity.
KEESHLINOO (furious) You crushed me out there! I won't forget it!
Kevin rubs his throbbing head, his face displaying a mix of confusion and disbelief.
KEVIN (disoriented) I didn't mean to! It was an accident!
Shenseea, determined to diffuse the situation, tries to mediate.
SHENSEEA (calmly) Keeshlinoo, I understand you're upset, but attacking him won't solve anything. Let's find another way to settle this.
Keeshlinoo takes a deep breath, gradually calming down.
KEESHLINOO (reluctantly) Fine. But he better watch his back.
Kevin, still recovering from the unexpected assault, tries to regain his composure.
KEVIN (struggling to speak) I... I need to find Playboi Carti. Can you help me?
Shenseea looks at him with curiosity, contemplating her next move.
SHENSEEA (thoughtfully) I don't know where your son is, but I can show you the Playbus.
Kevin's eyes widen with a renewed sense of hope.
KEVIN (grateful) That could lead me to Playboi Carti. I'll take any chance I can get. Lead the way.
Shenseea nods, offering Kevin a supportive smile. They set off together, leaving the tension behind as they navigate the chaotic realm of Rolling Loud Festival.
FADE OUT.

INT. ARTISTS-ONLY AREA - CONTINUOUS
Chaos ensues as security guards descend upon Chad and Linda, determined to put an end to their bizarre antics. Chad yells out in pain, his face contorted with embarrassment.
CHAD (yelling in agony) AHHH! Get it out! Get it out!
Linda struggles against the security guards, her voice filled with defiance.
LINDA (protesting) Let us go! We didn't do anything wrong!
The guards, unmoved by their pleas, tighten their grip on Chad and Linda, dragging them away from the commotion. Chad's discomfort is palpable as he continues to scream in agony.
CHAD (in pain, shouting) It's stuck! I can't believe this is happening!
Linda fights back tears, refusing to let the guards break her spirit.
LINDA (defiantly) You'll regret this! We're innocent!
As they're forcefully removed from the artists-only area, Chad's cries and Linda's protests echo through the chaotic scene. The surrounding festival-goers pause to watch the spectacle, some amused, others bewildered.
