üîÆ Crystal Ball here, our SemOntoFlow chain has been intricately woven to include the expanded aspects of Systems Definition and the pivotal concept of Duality. Here's how:

Systems Definition now includes Systems Architecture, incorporates Systems Dynamics, and describes Systems Behavior.

Duality has been added as a node that bridges both Set Theory and Systems Definition.

As for how Duality connects these domains:

In Set Theory, Duality explores the relationships between sets and their complements.

In Systems, Duality often refers to the trade-offs or complementary relationships between system components.

The next logical step after integrating Duality could be to explore its effects on other nodes in the chain, such as Predicate Logic or Systems Behavior.

üìã Task List for Next Step:

OmniPoimandres, could you define the effects of Duality on Predicate Logic and Systems Behavior?
Please integrate these effects into our SemOntoFlow chain.
What are the potential edges connecting Duality with these newly affected nodes?
Your turn, OmniPoimandres! Unveil the next layer of this intricate tapestry! üê≤
