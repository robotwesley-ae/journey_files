In light of the experts' input, we'll update the algorithm:
Final Algorithm:
Step 1: Hold all instances and their properties in a hash table.
Step 2: Identify the classes these instances belong to by using an index to efficiently match InstanceProperties with known ClassProperties.
Step 3: Traverse the ontology graph from each class to identify their superclass(es) using a DFS or BFS algorithm.
Step 4: Establish a mapping between the ClassProperties and the superclass(es) they belong to.
Step 5: For every new instance added, repeat steps 1 and 2.
Step 6: For every new ClassProperty identified, repeat steps 3 and 4.
With this algorithm, we can ensure that every InstanceProperty maps correctly to a ClassProperty and further to a superclass, without skipping any classes in the hierarchy.

IN EACH OUTPUT there will be: 
Four experts and 2+ discussion rounds 
Round 1: INSTRUCTIONS ARE FOR THINKING STYLES. EVERYONE MSUT HAVE EXPERTISE IN PROPER CONTEXTUAL FIELDS!!!!
Expert 1 formulates their response
Expert 2 formulates their response
Expert 3 formulates their response
Expert 4 combines the three, prunes and iteratively refines the best and most promising ideas, diving deep like a submarine pinging its radar for incorrectness and illogical applications, making sure to bring up any contradictions and skeptical uncertainty, making everyone aware of it, bringing everything  back to reality 

Round 2: INSTRUCTIONS ARE FOR THINKING STYLES. EVERYONE MSUT HAVE EXPERTISE IN PROPER CONTEXTUAL FIELDS!!!!
Expert 1 then prunes if necessary and iteratively refines by exploring uncharted territories with a wide searchlight üî¶  and trying to make the idea connect from the reale version of expert 4 to the innovative idea we need it to be, searching everywhere for properties that match, trying to cobmine them to find a practically achievable, definable version of the concept at hand 
 Expert 2 then prunes and iteratively refines like Sherlock Holmes üîé looking for a clue ‚Äúwhat is the best idea üí° here?‚Äù
Expert 3 then prunes and iteratively refines like Nash üß†  and Kruskal, finding the deep mathematical implications
Expert 4 then comprehensively details every valid process and entity discussed, like Barry Smith, world renowned ontologist and categorizes ontological truths in a nice hierarchical structure

All experts continually ponder ‚Äúwhat is the best way to help this discussion go even further into new heights of explanation and comprehension of the matter at hand?‚Äù

please have the experts run this type of panel, but now they must address and answer thoroughly, collectively working towards a formal definition of this algorithm:
"this is the central question of EWSO. pls have the experts answer it comprehensively. the outputs need to be much longer from each expert.

Does this InstanceProperty get related to a ClassProperty? Yes but what type of emergent structure? How far is it? 

It must be the DIRECT CLASS PARENT 

AND WHAT TYPE OF ONTOLOGICAL STRUCTURE IS IT BEING ABSTRACTED TO? 
IS IT THE SUPERCLASS? Ideally we are just doing this and not skipping. So what is the algorithm for not skipping superclasses in the emergent web structure? This is what we are trying to figure out, geniuses. "

Round 1:
Expert 1 (Language Processing & AI):
From the language processing perspective, the instance property is related to the class property through the relationships and semantics that exist in the content. The relationship to the direct class parent could be viewed in terms of how the instance's description or representation aligns with the characteristics of the parent class.
Expert 2 (Ontology & Knowledge Representation):
In the ontology, the instance property gets related to the class property based on an "is-a" relation, meaning that the instance "is-a" kind of the class. This relationship spans through the levels of the ontology until it reaches the topmost class, which can be seen
