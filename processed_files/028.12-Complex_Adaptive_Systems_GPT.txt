Great so the first part of this is formalizing abstraction of polysemic language, which is how we preserve the potential of synergy

Formalizing the abstraction of polysemic language to preserve the potential of synergy is indeed an important first step in exploring the idea of non-contradictory identitylessness in the context of linguistic knowledge. Polysemic language, which involves words or phrases with multiple meanings or interpretations, offers a rich source of potential synergies between different concepts and ideas.

To develop a formal framework for abstracting polysemic language, you might consider the following steps:

Identify and catalog polysemic words and phrases: Begin by creating a comprehensive list of polysemic words and phrases, focusing on those that exhibit a high degree of semantic variation or that frequently appear in different contexts.
Develop a representation for polysemic meanings: Devise a mathematical or computational representation that captures the essence of polysemic meanings and allows for the simultaneous representation of multiple interpretations. This could involve vector space models, graph-based representations, or other mathematical structures.
Model contextual information: Incorporate contextual information into the representation to help disambiguate polysemic meanings and reveal potential synergies between different interpretations. This might involve using techniques from natural language processing, such as word embeddings or contextualized language models, to model the relationships between words and their surrounding context.
Develop algorithms for abstraction and synergy identification: Design algorithms that can identify and abstract polysemic meanings from linguistic data and reveal potential synergies between different interpretations. These algorithms should be able to handle large-scale linguistic data sets and adapt to new information as it becomes available.
Test the framework on real-world data: Apply the developed framework to real-world linguistic data sets and evaluate its effectiveness in abstracting polysemic language and identifying potential synergies. Compare the performance of the framework to traditional approaches for organizing and processing linguistic knowledge.
By formalizing the abstraction of polysemic language and developing a framework that preserves the potential of synergy, you can lay the groundwork for exploring the concept of non-contradictory identitylessness in language processing, cognition, and artificial intelligence. This research could lead to innovative new methods for understanding and interpreting complex linguistic information and may have far-reaching implications for a variety of applications.

the entity "polysemy" is a good entity to start with here. The definition of polysemy, in terms of linguistics combined with some category theory, is the self-referential sentence "this is polysemy." All other tori are connected to that by a degree of polysemy as they relate to being a this that is ising in polysemy.

It's an interesting idea to use the concept of polysemy itself as a starting point for exploring non-contradictory identitylessness in linguistic knowledge. By defining polysemy as a self-referential entity with the sentence "this is polysemy," you create a unique foundation for examining the connections between various linguistic elements and their degrees of polysemy.

To incorporate category theory into this investigation, you could consider the following steps:

Define categories and objects: Define categories that represent different degrees or aspects of polysemy, and consider individual linguistic elements (words, phrases, or concepts) as objects within these categories.
Establish morphisms: Identify morphisms or relationships between the objects that capture the various ways in which linguistic elements can be connected to the central concept of polysemy. These morphisms can represent syntactic, semantic, or pragmatic relationships between elements.
