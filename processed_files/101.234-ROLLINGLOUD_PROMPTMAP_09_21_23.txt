 Linda continues talking.
LINDA I don't really know much about festivals, to be honest. I was just bored and thought I'd give volunteering a shot.
Chad snickers and accepts Linda's offer on behalf of both of them, while Kevin hesitates.
Linda prepares their drinks and hands them towels to clean themselves. She chats excitedly about the festival, mispronouncing band names and showcasing her peculiar dance moves.
LINDA You look like you could use some cheering up. Did you know it's a festival tradition to trade shoelaces with strangers? It's a great way to make new friends!
Chad scoffs and interrupts.
CHAD (laughing) Yeah, 'cause that's totally not weird at all.
Linda glares at Chad before turning to Kevin.
LINDA Come on, Kevin, live a little. It's Rolling Loud, after all.
Chad chimes in, trying to persuade Kevin.
CHAD Yeah, one drink won't hurt. We're here to have fun, right?
Kevin hesitates, unsure.
KEVIN I don't know.
Linda and Chad continue to persuade Kevin, with Linda saying:
LINDA Don't worry. Zion probably just needed some space and wanted to hang out with kids his own age without his dad.
Kevin gets defensive.
KEVIN (angry) Zion would NEVER do something like that.
Seeing that Kevin is still hesitant, Chad and Linda persist.
CHAD Aw, come on, don't be such a party pooper.
Linda adds:
LINDA We're just trying to help you relax a bit. It's not every day you get to experience Rolling Loud!
Feeling the pressure, Kevin finally relents.
KEVIN (sighing) Okay, fine. One drink.
Chad and Linda cheer, celebrating Kevin's decision. Their bickering resumes when Linda offers something more intense.
LINDA How about we take it up a notch? Shots for everyone!
She quickly pours shots for the three of them.
As they down their shots, Chad pulls out a small bag of cocaine, grinning mischievously.
CHAD Hey, why not kick it up even further? It's Rolling Loud, after all.
Kevin's eyes widen in shock as Chad and Linda partake in the drug. He's taken aback by the turn of events and can't believe the situation he's found himself in.
Linda casually mentions:
LINDA I took a couple of pills called '9/11' and dropped them in our shots. I don't even know what they do.
In a sudden burst of anger, Kevin snaps at them.
KEVIN (enraged) What the hell is wrong with you? I'm here trying to find my lost 13-year-old son, Zion, and you're drugging our drinks?
Linda's face falls, and she looks genuinely upset.
LINDA (apologetic) I'm so sorry, Kevin. I didn't know. I was just trying to help you relax and have some fun.
Kevin, trying to calm down, responds.
KEVIN Look, I appreciate that, but my priority is finding my son.
Linda nods, eager to make amends.
LINDA I understand. As a volunteer, I have some access to the festival's resources.
She quickly spots a table with several walkie-talkies for the volunteers and swipes two more, handing one to Kevin and another to Chad.
LINDA Now we can all communicate with other volunteers and security. We'll find him together.
Kevin, still frustrated but realizing Linda's genuine desire to help, takes the walkie-talkie.
KEVIN (slightly calmer) Alright, let's regroup and use these to coordinate our search. We need to cover as much ground as possible.
Chad, feeling remorseful, chimes in.
CHAD (sincerely) I'm sorry, Kevin. I didn't mean for things to get this out of hand. Let's find Zion and make things right.
They share a moment of understanding and determination. Linda, Kevin, and Chad form an unlikely alliance, united by their shared mission to locate Zion amidst the chaos of the festival.
They take a deep breath, ready to face the challenges ahead, and start moving towards their next destination, walkie-talkies in hand, prepared to navigate the festival grounds in search of Kevin's missing son.

rewrite, but have Chad and Kevin introduce themselves and explain their situation

EXT. SECLUDED AREA BEHIND CONCESSION STANDS - ROLLING LOUD VENUE - NIGHT
Chad nods solemnly, realizing the gravity of the situation.
Linda, a festival volunteer with an enthusiastic demeanor, approaches them. She wears an oversized pair of sunglasses, a glittery fanny pack, and a festival volunteer t-shirt. She hands each of them a towel.
