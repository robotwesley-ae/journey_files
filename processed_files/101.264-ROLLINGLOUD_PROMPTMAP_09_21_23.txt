BRITTANY I'm Brittany.
TIFFANY I'm Tiffany.
The girls are both wearing "artists only" bracelets, piquing Kevin's curiosity.
CHAD (enjoying the attention) I'm Chad, and this is my best friend, G.D.
KEVIN (chuckles) It's Kevin.
LINDA I'm Linda.
The girls pay no attention to Linda as Chad tries to keep her out of the conversation.
CHAD (whispers to the girls) It stands for "Girthy Dick."
BRITTANY (raising an eyebrow) Oh, really?
KEVIN (dismissing Chad's comment) No, not really.
Chad nods and whispers "yes, really."
BRITTANY (flirting) You were so hot on stage. I bet you can show us some moves.
CHAD (smiling) He's got some killer dance skills, that's for sure.
TIFFANY (smirking) You're a DILF, you know?
CHAD (teasingly) It means "Dad I'd Like to F..."
KEVIN (embarrassed) Um, thanks? I appreciate the compliment.
Kevin feels torn between the attention and his concern for Zion. His gaze shifts to his wedding ring.
TIFFANY (excited) Do you have Snapchat? Let's add each other!
KEVIN (reluctant) I don't really use Snapchat.
BRITTANY (giggling) Well, you do now! Let's sign you up.
The girls take Kevin's phone and guide him through the sign-up process, adding themselves as his friends. Kevin's conflicting emotions resurface as he questions his actions.
LINDA (disinterested) Ugh, I'll never understand Snapchat.
As the girls send silly photos to Kevin, he tries to relax but can't shake the weight of his wedding ring and his mission to find Zion. Tension builds between Chad and Linda, their animosity growing more apparent with each sarcastic remark.
Finally, unable to ignore his conscience, Kevin blurts out.
KEVIN I'm married, you know.
TIFFANY (laughing) I know, silly. That's why I gave you Snapchat!

add a bunch of dialogue before Tiffany asks if they are on Snapchat. They should discuss festivals, losing Zion, etc....

EXT. FESTIVAL GROUNDS - BOOZE TENT - NIGHT
Kevin, Chad, and Linda sit at a small table in the bustling booze tent, seeking a moment of respite, trying to blend in.
CHAD That was intense.
LINDA (nods) We just caused a power outage.
CHAD Remember that time we caused a power outage during the basketball game? We doubled team the girl in the bear mascot.
KEVIN (confused) That never happened, Chad. Don't make things up.
LINDA (trying to be included) I could wear a bear mascot too.
CHAD (sighs) Linda, you're not part of this memory. Let's focus.
The conversation drifts to more serious matters.
KEVIN (looking worried) I can't believe we're at a festival, and Zion is still missing. What if he's out there alone?
LINDA (trying to be reassuring) We'll find him, Kevin. We'll keep searching. Remember, festivals are huge. It's easy for someone to get lost in the crowd.
CHAD (optimistic) And there are so many volunteers and security personnel around. We just need to stay positive and keep looking.
They take a moment of silence, reflecting on their shared concern.
CHAD (trying to change the mood) Hey, remember the first festival we attended together? That insane mud pit where we lost our shoes?
LINDA (laughing) Oh, how could I forget? We were a muddy mess by the end of it.
KEVIN (smiling) Yeah, that was quite an adventure. Good times.
As they reminisce, two intoxicated girls, BRITTANY and TIFFANY, lock eyes with Kevin and approach.
CHAD (nudging Kevin) Looks like you've got some fans.
BRITTANY (giggling) I recognize you! You were dancing with the little person during Shenseea's performance, right?
The girls seem fixated on Kevin. He starts feeling watched and uneasy.
TIFFANY You were awesome up there!
BRITTANY Mind if we join you?
KEVIN (about to decline) Actually, I don't--
CHAD (smiling) Um, sure.
Chad pulls a free chair over and subtly pushes Linda off her chair, offering it to the girls.
LINDA (annoyed) Hey!
CHAD (low voice) You don't need to sit.
Linda rolls her eyes and grabs another chair for herself.
BRITTANY I'm Brittany.
TIFFANY I'm Tiffany.
The girls are both wearing "artists only" bracelets, piquing Kevin's curiosity.
CHAD (enjoying the attention) I'm Chad, and this is my best friend, G.D.
KEVIN (chuckles) It's Kevin.
LINDA I'm Linda.
