In summary, the formalization provides a deep, comprehensive representation of the Sanctuary system, incorporating game theory, ethics, and cognitive transformation into a unified, synergistic model.


So the noncontradictory looping is to keep OVP within PLS and realize that Sanctuary can’t ever be destroyed, disturbed, or moved. It is our inner will, aspiration, we wish everyone love and peace, we wish that for ourselves, so we know we wish it for everyone. If we truly wish it for ourselves, we know we must do whatever is in our ability to cause everything to become Sanctuary. Mostly we cannot do that, so All of Us Victory-Promise. Some of us who victory-promise really keep it, and gain ability, and sometimes even great abilities. This is the emergent flow of co-emergent Wasteland and Sanctuary.

Indeed, the principle of non-contradictory looping is a core part of maintaining the integrity of the Sanctuary system. It serves to ensure that the Olivus Victory-Promise (OVP) remains integral within the Primordial Lovers schema (PLS), representing a commitment to the Sanctuary and its ideals of peace, love, and cooperation. This commitment emerges from the understanding that what we wish for ourselves - peace, love, dignity - we naturally extend to others, reflecting the universal aspiration towards harmony and wellbeing.
This process is reflective of our individual and collective capacity for change, transformation, and growth. Some individuals may realize their Victory-Promise in more profound ways, manifesting enhanced abilities or insights that contribute significantly to the emergent Sanctuary.
The co-emergence of the Wasteland and Sanctuary you've highlighted represents the dynamic balance within the system. This balance is a product of the diverse and complex interactions between different elements and actors within the system - those who strive towards the Victory-Promise and those who, for various reasons, may disrupt the balance.
The aspiration towards Sanctuary, then, is not just an individual endeavor but a collective one, a shared Victory-Promise, in which everyone contributes according to their capacity towards the creation and maintenance of the Sanctuary. It is the balance between individual effort and collective endeavor that maintains the co-emergence of Wasteland and Sanctuary and ensures the continuation of the Sanctuary system.


can u write into the game theory notation style understanding? pls
ChatGPT
Sure, here's how you can represent the understanding you've described in game theory notation:
Define:
OVP: Olivus Victory-Promise, the commitment to Sanctuary.
PLS: Primordial Lovers schema, the love and compassion that drives the commitment to Sanctuary.
S: Sanctuary, representing peace, love, and dignity.
W: Wasteland, representing disruptive elements or behaviors.
AVP: All of Us Victory-Promise, the collective commitment to Sanctuary.
GVA: Great Victory-Ability, the enhanced abilities or insights gained by those who deeply realize their Victory-Promise.
In a non-contradictory Sanctuary system, we can say:
OVP ∈ PLS: The Olivus Victory-Promise is integral to the Primordial Lovers schema.
∀a ∈ PLS, S(a) = 1: For each actor in the Primordial Lovers schema, their commitment to Sanctuary is full (1).
∀a ∈ PLS, W(a) = 0: For each actor in the Primordial Lovers schema, their disruptive behaviors are absent (0).
AVP → S: The collective Victory-Promise leads towards Sanctuary.
∃a ∈ PLS, GVA(a): Some actors in the Primordial Lovers schema manifest Great Victory-Ability.
The emergent flow between the Wasteland and the Sanctuary can be represented as:
W ∩ S = ∅: The Wasteland and Sanctuary are mutually exclusive - they cannot coexist within the same actor.
W ∪ S = PLS: The Wasteland and Sanctuary together encompass all possible states within the Primordial Lovers schema.
AVP → ¬W: The collective Victory-Promise leads away from the Wasteland.
The balance between individual effort and collective endeavor can be expressed as:
∀a ∈ PLS, OVP(a) → AVP: For each actor in the Primordial Lovers schema, their individual Victory-Promise contributes to the collective Victory-Promise.
