a. Lock Mode: Display a toroidal visualization with heat maps representing the amplitudes of properties for an entity or a class of entities. Allow users to interact with the heat maps and navigate the space without affecting the knowledge graph.
b. Unlock Mode: Unfreeze the knowledge graph location and let users move within the overall space to view classes of entities and their relationships.
Encryption Consistency: Maintain consistent encryption throughout the entire space. Be aware that as the encryption tokens grow in size, patterns may become unidentifiable when users move too far from the initial load-in point.
This description should provide a more professional and connected explanation of the system you envision. If you have any further questions or need clarification, please let me know.


Can you represent this in some charts and graphs used in software development using json or another language that i can put into some program and visualize?
It would be challenging to represent this complex system as charts and graphs directly in JSON format or another programming language. However, I can provide you with a textual description of the different components and their relationships that you can later visualize using your preferred diagramming tool or software.
You can create a block diagram to represent the system with the following components:
Knowledge Graphs
Polysemic Linguistic Program
Cryptographic Classifier
Visualizer Stack
Graphical User Interface (GUI)
Query Input
Visualization Output
Query Processing
Search on Established Knowledge
Ontological Word Embedding
Encryption Algorithm
Domain-Specific Encryption
Subdomain Exploration
Schema-Based Encryption
Encryption Symbol Key
Boundary Populating
Token Position Calculation
Relationship Mapping
Visualization Modes
Lock Mode
Unlock Mode
You can represent these components as boxes in a block diagram and connect them using arrows to indicate the flow of data and processes between each component.
For a more detailed visualization, you could create a flowchart or a UML (Unified Modeling Language) diagram using a diagramming tool like draw.io, Lucidchart, or Microsoft Visio.
To visualize the components in JSON format, you can create a JSON object with nested objects representing the components and their relationships, but JSON is not designed for visual representation.
Here's an example of how the system components could be represented in a JSON format:
json
Copy code
{ "KnowledgeGraphs": { "PolysemicLinguisticProgram": {}, "CryptographicClassifier": {}, "VisualizerStack": {} }, "GraphicalUserInterface": { "QueryInput": {}, "VisualizationOutput": {} }, "QueryProcessing": { "SearchOnEstablishedKnowledge": {}, "OntologicalWordEmbedding": {}, "EncryptionAlgorithm": {} }, "DomainSpecificEncryption": { "SubdomainExploration": {}, "SchemaBasedEncryption": {}, "EncryptionSymbolKey": {} }, "BoundaryPopulating": { "TokenPositionCalculation": {}, "RelationshipMapping": {} }, "VisualizationModes": { "LockMode": {}, "UnlockMode": {} } }
This JSON structure can be used as a starting point to include additional details or metadata about each component, but it's essential to note that JSON is a data interchange format and not intended for visualization purposes.


Are there terms we have been using unique to the way I have been talking about this that I should try to reconcile with known CS terms?
Yes, there are some terms and concepts in our discussion that seem to be unique or not directly mapped to common computer science terminology. I'll list some of them here and provide suggestions for more widely used terms or concepts that might be related.
Polysemic Linguistic Program: This term is not commonly used in computer science. It could be replaced with "Natural Language Processing (NLP) System" or "Semantic Analysis System" if the purpose is to process and analyze language data with multiple meanings.
Cryptographic Classifier: This term is also not a standard term in computer science. Depending on the functionality, it could be replaced with "Data Encoding" or "Data Transformation" if the goal is to represent data in a more compact or encrypted form.
