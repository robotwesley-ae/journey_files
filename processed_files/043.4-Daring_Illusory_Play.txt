Wisdom Maya of the Path 
Inner Wisdom Maya 

So first we start out with poisonous maya 
We believe that inner wisdom maya exists outside as some kind of “enlightenment from an uncovered source that is either inner or external” 
We suffer from outer phenomena, inner phenomena, and secret depression and mania 
We look for a cure
Somebody helps us
We wonder how
We follow that wisdom to the path 

Path of Mind Protection - very slowly cover a mind, then provide the thread they can pull to uncover it

You are now supposed to practice and praised for doing so
You obey the rules of practice
You believe practice is the truth
Practice is the key to a new life in the divine hierarchy
Practice is the best worship, the most virtuous thing
You are sanctioned to become a fanatic
You are sanctioned to enact divine activity in the form of upholding ritual order
Divine boons are better than orgasm
Renunciation of other paths leads to bliss
The path transforms you into nothing but a display of the path
Encouraged to engage in true submission as an act of love and teased with a reward
Pleasure only comes from tireless obedience to the supreme emanation
You are now under the control of the emanations of the supreme emanation’s root wisdom
You were born to be connected with your teachers and the Teacher
Secret activity names spark your fervor 
The main meditation is absorption in the activity due to the teachings of the teacher’s Teacher
The blessings of the Teacher’s inescapable compassion permeate these teacher’s teachings and cause your mind to open up uncontrollably as the lineage of awakening’s infinite love wells forth from deep within you
Keep taking initiation in the same ways and afterward receive the blessings of praise over and over

Path Maya
We believe wisdom is outside and someone else has it because they possess something we don’t (pure wisdom due to pure mind)
We set out to purify our mind according to their instructions 
We are introduced to Identityless self wisdom 
We wonder how that reconciles with the phenomena which we still reify as outer
Then we are introduced to the identitylessness of phenomena as light
Then we collapse the concept of light or not light into brilliance
With confidence in brilliance, the “pure reality of light” dissolves into the “impure reality of poison” and ideas of pure and impure become primordially pure brilliance of the wisdom display of timeless webbed infinitude of infinite perfection 

Quotes
“Perception management combines truth projection, operations security, cover and deception, and psychological operations.”

“It is absolutely vital that the Perception Management campaign of the United States and its allies be coordinated at the highest possible level, that it be resourced adequately, and executed effectively. Properly coordinated, such a campaign could be a war-winning capability. When left uncoordinated, such operations will achieve only modest success, at best, and at worst, could seriously backfire. Even a poorly chosen word, used in the heat of the moment (e.g. 'crusade'), can have significant negative consequences.”

Counter Terrorism (countering demonic activity)

Political parties and actors can choose between two fundamental methods: leading the market or following the market. Leading the market involves fulfilling underlying demands of principle, and a political actor would essentially assume the position of one who leads on their own ideas and principles. Following the market entails the political actor's reliance on research such as public opinion surveys and adoption of those principles and ideas held by the majority of the people who the political actor wishes to influence.
