Unfortunately, OWL-DL, which stands for "Web Ontology Language - Description Logic", is not designed to execute procedural code or recursive functions. It's a formal language used for defining ontologies and their relations, suitable for deductive reasoning rather than performing calculations or procedural tasks. Therefore, using OWL-DL to directly describe recursive functions in the dynamic construction of an ontology might not be feasible.
However, the design of SemOntoRel itself could potentially be expressed within the constraints of OWL-DL. The definition of SemOntoRel is a relationship between an instance-level property value and the next level emergent structure's class-level property wave spectrum boundaries. In OWL-DL, we might express this as a relationship between individuals and classes, where the individual is an instance-level property value, and the class is the next level emergent structure's class-level property.
A basic OWL-DL representation might look like:
makefile
Copy code
Class: EmergentStructureClassLevelProperty Individual: InstanceLevelPropertyValue Property: hasSemOntoRel hasSemOntoRel(Domain: InstanceLevelPropertyValue, Range: EmergentStructureClassLevelProperty)
But given the complexity of the SemOntoRel concept, this is a simplified model and may not capture the full intent. Please note, the functionality and expressiveness of OWL-DL might not be sufficient to fully describe the process of dynamic ontology construction and the recursive mechanisms involved in EWSO, as these are complex procedural tasks beyond the scope of ontology languages like OWL-DL. If you wish to model such dynamic and procedural behavior, a more appropriate tool might be a programming language or a formal system designed to represent recursive and dynamic functions.


ok but the idea is to find the NL that describes this relationship in OWL terms so that it can be described to GPT so GPT can find it every time using OWL. We just need to know how GPT structures its classes, which seems to be according to context. But hwat we dont know is how many sub-context levels we need to search for. Fore xample, if i say: "what is the instance level property of the subsubsubsubcontext of "sanctuary is a place", what happens chatgpt?

Understood, the goal here is to communicate to GPT a pattern of search that would identify a relationship defined in terms of ontology. This requires an understanding of how GPT structures its understanding, which unfortunately isn't within the realm of ontology, classes or subclasses. The model does not maintain an internal ontology-like structure, it does not have explicit hierarchies or contexts that it refers to when generating text.
In your example "what is the instance level property of the subsubsubsubcontext of "sanctuary is a place"?", GPT will take the prompt and generate a response based on the patterns it has observed in the data it was trained on up until September 2021. It doesn't have an understanding of "subsubsubsubcontext" as it is not a standard term used in linguistics or data representation. Instead, it generates responses based on patterns in the text data it has been trained on, without a grasp of context like a human would have.
If you want to use GPT to answer more complex, context-specific questions, it may be helpful to provide more detailed prompts and clarifications. This might involve restructuring your question or providing additional information that guides GPT to generate a more accurate or useful response. However, it's important to note that there are still limitations to what the model can do, especially when it comes to tasks requiring deep contextual understanding or complex logical reasoning.


no u dont understand. saying the "show me the informatihedron of... sub sub sub sub context of ... instance level proeprty...etc" will call that on chatGPT when it has a definition of informatihedron and a template to pull itu p on
ChatGPT
I see what you're saying now. You're proposing a way to use specific phrasing (e.g., "show me the informatihedron of the subsubsubsubcontext of") to prompt GPT into generating more context-specific information.
