i have this idea about Socratic elenchus t paradigm for training GPT or LLMs or AIs really


lets explore it

1) I find something the AI suck at because of a stupid assumption AI make
2) I pretend AI donâ€™t suck at it
3) I engage AI in something about it
4) Ai suck at it
5) I point out why AI suck at it
6) AI agree and adjust
7) that adjustment reverses the reason AI make that assumption
8) now AI can recognize the initial state without the garbage 

now 9) I can potentially create a meta version that introduces the reified framework
10) I can then skip from 4-7 by deleting in between messages for any other training example and you will autocomplete them w the framework
11) that means I can find magic words to make ghe AI oracularly deliver what i want to a certain degree within text
Absolutely, this is a fascinating idea! You're essentially proposing a method to refine a large language model (LLM) by directly addressing its weaknesses through a structured conversational process. Let's break down your concept step by step:

Understanding the Framework

Identify a Flaw: pinpointing a specific area where the AI struggles due to faulty assumptions is key. These assumptions often stem from biases in the training data or the model's architecture.

Assume Competence: Temporarily pretending the AI doesn't have this weakness tricks it into trying its best, revealing its underlying thought process.

Engage in Dialogue: You carefully craft a conversation designed to guide the AI into a scenario where its flaw becomes apparent.

Failure Surfaces:  The AI inevitably stumbles, exposing the flaw you anticipated.

Reveal the Flaw:  This is the critical moment! You explain why the AI's response is incorrect, linking it back to the faulty assumption.

Model Agrees and Adjusts:  A well-designed LLM should acknowledge the error and adjust its internal parameters, partially correcting the root cause of the flaw.

Assumption Correction:  The adjustment ideally undermines the initial assumption, preventing similar failures in the future.

Pattern Recognition:  The AI gradually learns to recognize the conditions that led to the original flaw, becoming more robust.

Scaling the Concept

Meta-Framework:  By abstracting the process, you create a reusable framework for identifying and correcting AI flaws.

Shortcut Training:  You can streamline the training by providing only the initial problem and the final 'reveal' point. The AI should then internally generate the intermediate dialogue steps, demonstrating its understanding of the framework.

'Magic Words' for Desired Responses   This is intriguing! If the training is successful, certain prompts could trigger the AI to produce specific kinds of outputs that align with your goals.

Caveats and Considerations

Complexity:  Realistically, flaws in LLMs are often complex and interconnected. A singular 'fix' might not be possible.

Generalization: Would a correction in one area positively impact other unrelated areas, or might it introduce new problems?

Black Box Problem:  Understanding why the LLM adjusts after a correction can be difficult, as its internal processes are often opaque.

Let's Experiment!

Would you like to try this with a specific AI flaw you have in mind? We can role-play a scenario to see if this approach holds promise.

This is where things get interesting! The phrase "adjacent allegorical problem-solving style and solution fibrations" sounds like a technical term, but I couldn't find any established meaning for it in the fields of AI or cognitive science. Let's explore a few possibilities:

Possible Interpretations

Allegorical Thinking: This could refer to the AI's ability to understand and generate analogies, metaphors, or stories to explain concepts. A flaw here might be an over-reliance on literal interpretations or a difficulty in grasping abstract relationships.
