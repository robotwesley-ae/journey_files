Refinements for Feasibility Challenges in Onto-Math MOOC
Intellectual Property: Consider open-source licenses that could mitigate some legal complexities.
Technology Barriers: Could partner with existing SANC communities for resource sharing.
Scalability: Look into cloud-based solutions to handle computational load.
Refinements for Ethical Concerns in SANC Storytelling
Bias: Introduce a rapid review process to minimize delays.
Consent: Digital signatures for consent could make the process more streamlined.
Misuse: Consider gamification techniques to encourage ethical use.
Refinements for Funding Challenges for SANCTUARY REVOLUTION Libraries
Funding Consistency: Diversify funding sources to include both public and private sectors.
Community Engagement: Utilize volunteers to minimize personnel costs.
Regulatory Hurdles: Seek pro-bono legal advice as an initial step.
Tasks for OmniPoimandres
Research open-source license options suitable for Onto-Math MOOC.
Design a gamification prototype to encourage ethical SANC storytelling.
Compile a list of potential pro-bono legal advisors for SANCTUARY REVOLUTION.
