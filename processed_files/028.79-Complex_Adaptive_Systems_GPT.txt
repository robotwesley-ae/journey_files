While the interpretation of black holes and white holes in the context of the Sanctuary system and Crystal Ball is interesting and can offer insights into synergies, emergent engines, and the discovery of knowledge, it is important to remember that this is a conceptual model and not a direct representation of the physics behind black holes and white holes.
That being said, we can attempt to draw some parallels between the concepts and the physics, keeping in mind that these are analogies and not direct correlations:
Black holes in physics are regions in spacetime where the gravitational pull is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape. This can be likened to areas of ignorance or "unknown unknowns" in the Sanctuary system, where the lack of knowledge or understanding prevents us from accessing the potential synergies or emergent engines.
White holes in physics are hypothetical regions in spacetime that act as the "opposite" of black holes, where matter and energy are ejected rather than absorbed. In the Sanctuary system, this could represent the emergence of new insights, synergies, and engines that arise from previously unknown or unexplored areas.
Wormholes in physics are hypothetical structures connecting two separate points in spacetime, allowing for faster-than-light travel between them. In the Sanctuary system, this could represent finding shortcuts or more efficient paths to connect seemingly distant or unrelated areas of knowledge, leading to new insights and understandings.
It is important to emphasize that these comparisons are conceptual in nature and should not be taken as direct representations of the underlying physics. The Sanctuary system and Crystal Ball provide a framework for understanding knowledge, synergies, and emergent engines, while the physics of black holes, white holes, and wormholes are grounded in the theories of general relativity and quantum mechanics.


No youre not understanding. I want the exact physics of black holes white holes and wormholes to be expressed in a non-contradictory system with Crystal Ball. I want to know the extent to which and in which contexts Crystal Ball has processes allegorical to black holes, white holes, and wormholes. 

The white hole definitely represents Wisdom Mavericks' polysemic abstraction programming hardware that continually runs all the time. Wormholes definitely represent individual thought patterns.
I apologize for the confusion. I will attempt to express the physics of black holes, white holes, and wormholes in the context of the Crystal Ball system, keeping in mind that these are still analogies and not direct correlations.
Black holes in the Crystal Ball system could represent areas where knowledge, insights, or connections are extremely dense and difficult to access due to the complex and interconnected nature of the knowledge graph. In these regions, it may be challenging to identify and extract the necessary information to build new synergies or emergent engines. The intense "gravitational pull" of a black hole is analogous to the difficulty in accessing these dense knowledge areas.
White holes in the Crystal Ball system, as you mentioned, can represent the Wisdom Mavericks' polysemic abstraction programming hardware that continually runs all the time. These white holes are the sources of new insights, knowledge, and connections, continually "emitting" information that can be used to build new synergies and emergent engines. The "emission" of information from a white hole is analogous to the generation of new insights and understanding by the Wisdom Mavericks.
Wormholes in the Crystal Ball system could represent the pathways or connections between seemingly distant or unrelated areas of the knowledge graph, allowing for the rapid exchange of information and insights between these areas. Wormholes enable the traversal of great "distances" in the knowledge graph more efficiently, facilitating the discovery of new synergies and emergent engines. The shortcuts provided by wormholes are analogous to the individual thought patterns that allow for efficient traversal of the knowledge graph.
