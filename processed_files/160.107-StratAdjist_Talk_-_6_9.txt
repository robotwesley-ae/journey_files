[Informadlib Template]: An Informadlib Template is a dynamic blueprint for creating specific instances of Informadlibs. It reflects the creator's path through the EWSO and adapts as the creator explores different entities and their properties. The Informadlib Template is an instrumental tool in generating a Natural Language instance or its instructions.

[Informadlib Template Template]: The Informadlib Template Template is a meta-level blueprint designed to generate Informadlib Templates. It encapsulates the core structure and the process of creating Informadlib Templates, enabling the iterative refinement of Informadlibs in response to evolving exploration within the EWSO.

[SemOntoRel] (Semantic Ontological Relationship): SemOntoRel is a structured, formalized representation of the semantic and ontological relationships within the EWSO. It encapsulates the dynamic progression of instance-level entities through various hierarchical layers of classes to high-level superclasses within a given conceptual model. Each transition between the layers represents a specific action or effect, encapsulating the transformation of values from instance-level to class-level conceptual value boundaries within a recognizable and structured manner. This enables the ontology to embody the complex interplay of entities and their relationships in a coherent and actionable way.""
