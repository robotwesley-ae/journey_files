INT. ROLLING LOUD - FERRIS WHEEL - NIGHT
Chad, Linda, and Kevin find themselves stuck at the top of the Ferris wheel, the festival chaos below them. They're all visibly high, adding to the surreal situation.
Kevin (pointing): "Guys, we've got to figure out how to get down from here."
Chad (nervous laugh): "Yeah, like, now."
Linda (giggling): "I see a solution! Look over there!"
They spot a nearby pod with a GIANT STUFFED ANIMAL inside, practically the size of a small car. Kevin seizes on the idea.
Kevin (excitedly): "I've got an idea! We can use that giant stuffed animal as padding! I'll grab onto it, and we'll hop from pod to pod!"
They all nod, albeit with a tinge of uncertainty. Kevin climbs into the neighboring pod with the enormous stuffed animal, gripping it tightly. With Linda and Chad's help, they make the daring leap to the next pod.
Chad (breathing heavily): "That wasn't so bad!"
Linda (wide-eyed): "Yeah, we got this!"
They continue their descent, hopping from pod to pod, meeting eccentric festival-goers along the way. In one pod, they encounter a group of festival clowns who offer them balloon animals. In another, they meet a guy with a snake wrapped around his neck, causing Linda to squeal in delight.
As they approach a particularly challenging leap, Linda loses her grip on Chad's hand, and they watch in horror as she dangles precariously in mid-air.
Linda (panicked): "Guys! Help!"
Kevin reaches out and grabs Linda's hand just in time, pulling her back to safety.
Chad (relieved): "That was close!"
Finally, they reach the bottom of the Ferris wheel, breathless but exhilarated. They step off the ride and onto the festival grounds, feeling a newfound sense of camaraderie.
Kevin (grinning): "We did it! And we met some interesting characters along the way."
Chad (laughing): "Yeah, it was like a crazy adventure movie up there."
Linda (giggling): "I can't believe we survived!"
As they continue their Rolling Loud adventure, the memory of their Ferris wheel escapade becomes a wild and unforgettable part of their festival experience.
