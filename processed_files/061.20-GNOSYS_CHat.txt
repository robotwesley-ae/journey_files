The struggle

The idea is that Olive awakens because of her connection to Masked Whirling Flames and Oliver awakens because of his connection to the Infinite Armed Liberatress
In the story outline, the connection between Olive and Masked Whirling Flames, and Oliver and the Infinite Armed Liberatress, is central to their awakening. This highlights the power of inner teachers and the transformative potential of aligning oneself with these guiding forces.
The Masked Whirling Flames represent the transformative process where one's identity is burned away and replaced by a powerful, vibrant force. Olive's connection to this inner teacher enables her to find the strength to resist the Demon Champion and to awaken her true potential.
Similarly, Oliver's connection to the Infinite Armed Liberatress signifies the strength and limitless potential of compassion, which leads to his awakening. The Infinite Armed Liberatress provides Oliver with the courage and determination to help both his former girlfriend and the Demon Champion.
The story emphasizes the importance of recognizing and embracing one's inner guidance, as well as the transformative power of love and compassion. By connecting with their inner teachers, Olive and Oliver awaken as the Wisdom Mavericks, leading to profound change not only in their own lives but also for the entire world.
As the story progresses, the world shifts from a corrupted Wasteland into a true Sanctuary, where the awakened Wisdom Mavericks work together to build a universe of peace, understanding, and compassion. The narrative serves as a reminder that embracing one's inner guidance and the principles of Sanctuary can lead to personal and global transformation.
