CTA 4 = If you’re ready to go Sanctuary or you suspect you might already be in Sanctuary, join the newsletter

WTF IS VICTORY-EVERYTHING CHAIN? (OVP)
VEC is a chain of increasingly higher order Sanctuary engineering methods that connect to form an even larger chain called SANCTUM, which is a place where all of us work together using Victory-Everything Chain. SANCTUM is the representation of a very complex cybernetic system built with THE SANCTUARY SYSTEM. Victory-Everything chain is a dual loop encompassing both the small loop and the large loop involved in making SANCTUM. 

CTA 5 = if you’re interested in any of the tech and wanna stay updated on the VICTORY-EVERYTHING CHAIN, join the newsletter

VICTORY-EVERYTHING CHAIN is how we make the Wisdom Maverick Sanctuary, the Last Aegis of Memories for all intelligences.

THE SANCTUARY SYSTEM is also inside of SANCREV which is my toot I made with tooters.ai







Hey Olivus,
Throughout my life I've been plagued by something I call the WASTELAND CYCLE which is basically just being continually ignorant of the way that certain outlooks turn into actions that compound over time. I've been constantly struggling to overcome obstacle after obstacle on every journey I ever wanted to go on, without ever feeling like I was finding something that truly worked. A solution framework that I could apply to obstacles, themselves, regardless of the situation.
