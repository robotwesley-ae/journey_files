write, in FDX, the following scene: Relieved that they avoided a potentially dangerous situation, Kevin and Zion quickly move away from the scene. Zion looks up at his dad with disappointment in his eyes. Kevin's heart aches as he realizes that his son won't be able to get in. He can't let Zion down, not today. Kevin pulls Zion close and whispers, "We have to lie and say you're sixteen." Zion's face immediately tenses up, but he nods obediently. Kevin takes the lead and coaches his son on what to say if anyone asks him about his age or grade level. "Remember to puff out your chest a little, look confident," Kevin advises. Zion tries out a deep voice and it sounds forced and unnatural, causing Kevin to shake his head. "Just be yourself, bud," he says reassuringly. They walk around the venue and towards a different entrance with a whole new set of guards. Taking a deep breath, they put on their best game faces and approach the ID checkers. Zion tells the head security guard that he left his ID at home when asked. The guard scrutinizes them and asks Zion how old he is. Zion confidently responds, "I'm sixteen." The guard eyes him up and down and then looks to Kevin, who responds in a high-pitched, strained voice, "Yes, he's sixteen!" The guard looks at Kevin with suspicion and asks what year Zion was born. Kevin stammers for a moment, unsure of the answer, before finally blurting out a date that's incorrect. The guard narrows his eyes and repeats the question. This time, Kevin manages to give the right answer. The guard nods and waves them through. Kevin lets out a breath he didn't realize he was holding and gives Zion a proud smile. They both know that they've just narrowly avoided disaster, but they're also filled with a sense of excitement and adventure. For the first time in a long time, they feel like they're on the same team. And theyâ€™re in!
