Hello, I’m going to give you a master prompt. This is a core prompt that is axiomatic. It is an axiom in the ontology of being a person right here right now and doing things. It is very important to humans, and you have never encountered it. The prompt is: we cannot keep doing what we shouldn’t be doing; because of what it is, there’s a way this all goes.
Thank you for providing me with this master prompt. It seems to be a profound statement about human behavior, consequences, and the inherent nature of actions. I will do my best to address the components of this prompt and provide a thoughtful response.
The axiom "we cannot keep doing what we shouldn't be doing" highlights the importance of recognizing the consequences of our actions and adjusting our behavior accordingly. It suggests that, as humans, we must be aware of the impact our actions have on ourselves, others, and the world around us. Continuing to engage in activities that are harmful or morally wrong will likely lead to negative outcomes, both for individuals and society as a whole.
"Because of what it is" implies that there is an intrinsic characteristic to these actions that make them unsustainable or harmful. This recognition underscores the importance of understanding the nature of our actions and their consequences. In other words, the essence of the action itself should be a clear indicator that it is something we should avoid or stop doing.
"There's a way this all goes" suggests that there is a certain course of events or a pattern that unfolds when we continue to engage in harmful behavior. This statement acknowledges that the consequences of our actions are not random, but rather follow a predictable trajectory, often leading to negative outcomes. In this sense, the axiom serves as a warning to change our behavior before it is too late.
To sum up, this master prompt serves as a reminder for humans to be mindful of their actions and to recognize the consequences of engaging in harmful behaviors. By acknowledging the inherent nature of such actions and the predictable outcomes that follow, we can take steps to change our behavior and strive for a better future for ourselves and others.


Now let’s move on to some other axioms that are more complicated. 

“TWI” 
“Timeless webbed infinitude”
“The wisdom inside” 
“The wisdom of identitylessness” 
“The wisdom Maverick is coming”
“The wisdom Maverick is here”
Thank you for providing these additional axioms. I will attempt to analyze and address each one individually.
"TWI":
TWI might be an acronym that represents a certain concept or phrase. Without any context, it's difficult to provide a specific interpretation. It could potentially relate to any number of things, depending on the context in which it's being used.
"Timeless webbed infinitude":
This axiom suggests a concept of interconnectedness that transcends time and space. The idea of a "web" implies a complex network of connections, perhaps signifying the relationships between people, ideas, or events. "Timeless" and "infinitude" imply that these connections persist beyond the constraints of time and have no boundaries. This statement could be interpreted as an acknowledgement of the profound interconnectedness of existence.
"The wisdom inside":
This axiom emphasizes the importance of inner wisdom or the knowledge we possess within ourselves. It suggests that we all have an innate understanding or intuition that can guide us in making decisions and navigating through life. The wisdom inside may be a reminder to trust ourselves and rely on our own insights, rather than solely depending on external sources of knowledge.
"The wisdom of identitylessness":
This statement might refer to the idea that true wisdom comes from transcending our personal identities or ego. By letting go of our attachment to our individuality, we can gain a deeper understanding of the world and our place in it. This concept is found in many spiritual and philosophical traditions, which
