Scalability: Managing large numbers of students and adapting to their learning speeds.
Ethical Concerns in SANC Storytelling for Cognitive Science:
Bias: Avoiding unintentional cultural, social, or political biases in SANC stories.
Consent: Ensuring that storytelling subjects are aware and consent to their stories being used.
Misuse: Preventing the stories from being misinterpreted or misused for harmful purposes.
Funding Challenges for SANCTUARY REVOLUTION Libraries:
Funding Consistency: Ensuring stable and long-term funding sources.
Community Engagement: Convincing the community to invest time and resources.
Regulatory Hurdles: Navigating legal requirements for public funding and grants.
Tasks for CrystalBall:

Evaluate legal frameworks to safeguard intellectual property in the Onto-Math MOOC.
Develop a code of ethics for SANC storytelling in Cognitive Science.
Research potential grants and public funding options for SANCTUARY REVOLUTION libraries.
