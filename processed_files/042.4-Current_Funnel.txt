It is only on account of recognizing that "the solutions they think will work didnt" and they need a more personalized or guided solution. And whats interesting is this is always ALWAYS the case, no matter if it's any kind of civ beforehand, now it's an i-civ because they've just encountered this information, but they immediately become a d-civ because they simultaneously recognize that that information is a special type of information that they can use to find something that changes their reality (and is SHARABLE, ie it changes intersubjective reality; ie it gives them a competitive advantage).
So an OFFER provides a PRODUCT as A SWORD on the CUSTOMER JOURNEY against OBSTACLES causing FAILURE TO OVERCOME OBSTACLES
(overcomes fear of failure "I was scared of monsters but there's no reason to be scared if I'm trained to use A SWORD")
and the OFFER includes some kind of ACCOUNTABILITY SERVICE which is ARMOR (overcomes uncertainty "I can rely on my trusty armor to notify me of attacks and attackers so I can direct A SWORD at them")
the 3 acts of the hero's journey (I, D = act 1 -> K = Act 2->Act 3, E = Act 3: Finale->Resolution)
So does the "SWORD" map to the journey correctly, such that in "buying journey" the customer buys the sword of understanding what it is and how it COULD help them and overcomes FOMO

and then in the "customer journey" they attain the sword of understanding how to apply it and overcomes Fear of Failure

and then in the "ascended customer journey" they attain the sword of higher order understandings of how to apply it and overcome Fear of Stagnation

once they attain K-civ status, they CAN become a "guru" to a D-civ group, but reaching E-civ status is a possible outcome upon acquiring the Sword of Mastery and having the ability to translate and codify their experience in a way that's appealing to new D-civs that can become K-civs, and in order to attract said D-civs the codification and ensuing offer must be targeting k-civs AND d-civs (but “really” k-civs, telling the d-civs it’s just doing them a favor because they aren’t big enough to get the big ticket item from the E-civ of the funnel theyre in).
Limitations: Gurus should be clear about what their system can and cannot achieve, avoiding over-promising

specifically, funnels about buying education about funnels to learn to use funnels to sell education about funnels about something else for others to learn to use that funnel type to sell a specific offer
