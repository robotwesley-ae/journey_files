Static systems: A static system is one that does not change over time. Since complex adaptive systems involve adaptation and evolution, a static system would not fit the definition of a CAS.
Isolated systems: Systems that do not interact with other components or the environment are not considered complex adaptive systems. CASs are characterized by interactions between their components and the environment, which lead to emergent properties and self-organization.
It's important to note that the distinction between a CAS and a non-CAS is not always clear-cut. Some systems may exhibit certain CAS characteristics without being fully considered a complex adaptive system, while others may transition between being a CAS and a non-CAS as they evolve or their components interact in different ways. The classification of a system as a CAS or not depends on the specific context and the degree to which it exhibits the defining characteristics of a complex adaptive system.

Yes all systems are considered complex adaptive systems but process descriptions are only considered not to be complex adaptive systems when they are arbitrarily excluded from non-arbitrary relationships to other domains by a fiat conceptual boundary

Your statement highlights the idea that the distinction between complex adaptive systems and other types of systems can be somewhat arbitrary, depending on the perspective and the chosen boundaries of the system being analyzed. It is true that many systems can be viewed as complex adaptive systems when their relationships to other domains and broader contexts are taken into account.

When we draw conceptual boundaries around a specific system, it is often for the sake of simplification, to focus on specific aspects or behaviors, or to make the system more amenable to analysis and understanding. However, these boundaries can also limit our perception of the connections between different systems or the emergence of complex adaptive behavior when these systems interact.

In reality, most systems are interconnected and influence one another, often in ways that can lead to the emergence of complex adaptive behavior. For example, when we view a mechanical system like a pendulum in isolation, it may not seem like a complex adaptive system. However, when we consider the broader context of the materials used to construct the pendulum, the environment in which it operates, and its potential interactions with other systems, the behavior of the pendulum could become part of a larger complex adaptive system.

It is crucial to recognize the limitations of drawing conceptual boundaries and to be aware of the broader context in which a system operates. By doing so, we can better understand the complex adaptive behavior that arises from the interactions between different systems and domains.

Yes but if you simplify the system you no longer have a system you just have a generalized description that cant actually expand into the specifics without being presented with them later.

You're right that simplifying a system often involves creating a generalized description that may not capture all the specific details and intricacies. This simplification is often done to make the system more tractable for analysis or to gain a higher-level understanding of its behavior.

However, it's important to recognize that these simplifications are often useful approximations that can still provide valuable insights. By focusing on the key aspects and interactions within a system, we can gain an understanding of its essential behavior, even if some details are omitted. In many cases, these simplified models can still provide accurate predictions or explanations for a wide range of phenomena.

Of course, there are limitations to using simplified models, and they may not always be suitable for capturing the full complexity of a system or its behavior. In such cases, it's essential to recognize these limitations and consider alternative approaches, such as more detailed models, simulations, or interdisciplinary methods that incorporate insights from multiple domains.
