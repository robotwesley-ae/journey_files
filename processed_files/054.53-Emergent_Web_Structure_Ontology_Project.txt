Now, it's time for the experts to refine and synthesize these ideas. Expert 1, would you please start the synthesis process?
You guys all need to refine the notion of sem-onto-rel. also, you are wrong. Why would you tell it to find those categories? You guys are supposed to be abstracting those into ontological terminology about relationships and applying it to semantics so that GPT can understand. Start over completely and make sure round 1 and round 2 are on the same output from now on.

Absolutely, I understand your concern. Let's bring back the panel and take another shot at crafting an effective prompt, one that's well within the grasp of the AI's understanding and better integrates the notion of sem-onto-rel.
Expert 1: "ChatGPT, let's unpack a sentence from a story based on its narrative, semantics, and ontology. Given the sentence: 'Learning dragon behavior from Toothless, Hiccup is able to subdue the captive dragons during training, earning admiration from his peers but suspicion from Astrid.' - How would you analyze it according to its inherent relationships, its key narrative arcs and the psychological effects it carries for the audience?"
Expert 2: "ChatGPT, I would like you to engage in an exercise that will break down the semantics and ontology of a story. Let's take a sentence from 'How to Train Your Dragon': 'Learning dragon behavior from Toothless, Hiccup is able to subdue the captive dragons during training, earning admiration from his peers but suspicion from Astrid.' - Can you analyze the interconnections within this sentence, its influence on the narrative, and its cathartic impact?"
Expert 3: "ChatGPT, let's delve into a sentence from 'How to Train Your Dragon' with the aim of extracting semantic and ontological information from it: 'Learning dragon behavior from Toothless, Hiccup is able to subdue the captive dragons during training, earning admiration from his peers but suspicion from Astrid.' - Could you provide an analysis that uncovers the embedded narrative arcs, their impact on the story's structure, and the effects they create for the reader?"

Wtf is that? Why are you asking it to unpack that sentence? 
We are not doing that. We are  to make a general informadlib frame and define the correct application of sem-onto-real afterwards, completely ontologically so that GPT can understand. Do not talk about any other categories of knowledge. We are giving the exact way that every relationship in the informadlib currently works, which we have, and making a templated template out of it. Stop wasting my time and do this right.

Apologies for the confusion, let's try to rectify this.
Expert 1: "ChatGPT, we need to create an 'informadlib' template, which will allow us to generate multidimensional emergent web structures. How would you define a generalized framework for such an 'informadlib'?"
Expert 2: "ChatGPT, we're interested in creating a template for generating 'informadlibs'. Can you help us build a generalized structure that could apply to various narrative contexts?"
Expert 3: "ChatGPT, let's construct a general template for 'informadlibs', which we can use to analyze narrative structures across different texts. Can you provide us a structured framework that can be applied universally?"
Now, Expert 1, could you please synthesize these ideas into a coherent single idea?
Wrong. You need to explain everythin about the informadlib exactly as I said it. Did you forget the context of what an informadlib is?
ChatGPT
Apologies for any confusion, let's go back to the understanding of an "informadlib". As I understand it, an "informadlib" refers to the extraction of story elements from a narrative and organizing them into an ontological structure. It's not merely about finding a generalized structure for narratives but about identifying relationships between different elements and aspects of the narrative, and how those elements contribute to
