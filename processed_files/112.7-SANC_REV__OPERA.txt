THERE MUST BE THREE SEPARATE SPACES. ONE SPACE THAT IS ALL OF THE X-AXIS POINT POSITIONS, ONE FOR Y-AXIS POINT POSITIONS, ONE FOR Z-AXIS POINT POSITIONS. THEN WE KNOW WHAT EACH ONE REPRESENTS, AND THEN WHEN WE MAP IT, THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE SINGLE POINT ON THE MAP, *WHICH IS A SUPERORDINATE POINT IN THE TRANSFORMATION SPACE. EVERY SINGLE OTHER POINT IS A PERMUTATION OF 0,0,0 WHICH REPRESENTS THE ENTIRE ENTITY AS A DOMAIN ONTOLOGY, ITSELF, TO THE EXTENT WE HAVE DEFINED IT ALREADY.
THE COMBINATION IS INHERENT IN EVERY SINGLE POINT IN THE GRAPH. ALL U NEED TO DO IS HIGHLIGHT WHICH POINTS YOU HAVE REVEALED. IT SHOULD ONLY BE ONE SINGLE POINT, AND YOU ENUMERATE EVERY SINGLE MEANING OF EVERY SINGLE DIGIT IN THE POSITION YOU HAVE LABELED ON THE PLOT EVERY POINT ONE REPRESENTS A LATENT SPACE. IF IT IS NOT LABELED AS BEING KNOWNBY EXPLICITLY BEING MAPPED AS A POINT WITH DECIMALS THAT HAVE MEANINGS ACCORDING TO THE ROOT DOMAIN ONTOLOGY, the superordinate layer, THEN IT IS NOT ALLOWED TO BE MARKED.
