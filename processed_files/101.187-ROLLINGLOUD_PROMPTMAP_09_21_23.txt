Melanie gives him a stern, yet soft look.
MELANIE (gentle) We can't have another Disneyland situation, Kev.
Kevin rinses, setting down his toothbrush. He meets her reflection in the mirror, clearly annoyed.
KEVIN (exasperated) Yes, Mel, I remember. It was chaotic. I was the one looking for him.
Melanie holds her ground, her tone steady.
MELANIE (sincere) We can't risk that at a hip-hop fest. We need a safer plan.
A weighty silence fills the room. Melanie breaks it.
MELANIE (suggestive) What if we trade this festival for something he likes, but safer?
Kevin, mouth full of water, raises an eyebrow.
KEVIN (doubtful) Like what?
Melanie gives a faint smile, her eyes full of hope.
MELANIE (inspiring) I don't know, like... a day trip to a comic book store? An arcade? Make it a family thing?
Kevin, drying his face, seems to consider it.
KEVIN (thoughtful) That...might work. But how do we sell it?
Melanie locks eyes with Kevin, her determination clear.
MELANIE (earnest) We just tell him straight, Kev. We're not trying to kill his vibe. We just want him safe and happy.
Kevin gives a nod, some tension leaving his shoulders.
KEVIN (resigned) Alright. Safety first. We can work with that.
Melanie leaves, Kevin's eyes still on his own reflection, worry lingering in his gaze.
FADE OUT.

Kevin, toothbrush hanging from his mouth, is reading through the Rolling Loud website on his phone. Melanie walks in, leaning against the doorframe.
MELANIE (seriously) Kev, this Rolling Loud thing. We can't let him go.
Kevin, toothpaste foam around his mouth, nods and spins around to face Melanie.
KEVIN (muffled by toothpaste) I agree. He's way too young.
Melanie's gaze hardens, emphasizing her point.
MELANIE (remembering) And the Disneyland incident. We can't have a repeat of that.
Kevin rinses out his mouth, setting down his toothbrush with a sigh.
KEVIN (irritated) Yes, Mel, I remember. I was there, remember? That was a nightmare.
Melanie squares her shoulders, crossing her arms over her chest.
MELANIE (serious) And this festival... with the drugs, bad language, even guns. It's too risky, Kev.
Silence hangs in the air for a moment before Melanie breaks it.
MELANIE (suggesting) Maybe we could offer him something else, safer but still fun?
Kevin, wiping his mouth, gives her a skeptical look.
KEVIN (doubtful) Like what?
Melanie shrugs, trying to come up with an idea.
MELANIE (thinking) I don't know, a comic book convention, or an arcade day? Make it a family day out?
Kevin considers her suggestion, then slowly nods.
KEVIN (considering) Could work. But we need to be upfront with him.
Melanie looks him straight in the eye, her tone earnest.
MELANIE (sincere) We'll just tell him the truth. We're not denying him fun, we just want him safe.
Kevin sighs, running a hand through his hair.
KEVIN (resigned) Okay. Safety first. We can do this.
As Melanie leaves the room, Kevin stays staring at his reflection, his face lined with concern.
FADE OUT.

write the following scene out in FDX: As Kevin prepares to sleep on the couch, Melanie can't help but wonder if there's more to his reaction than just concern for Zion's well-being. The underlying tension between them suggests that there's more going on than meets the eye. Before settling down, he checks on Zion, who's fast asleep. Kevin gently removes the headphones from his son's ears, tucks him in, and plants a tender kiss on his forehead. Exhausted and heading to the couch to sleep, he notices the opened mail and paperwork that Melanie has left scattered across the couch. It's a subtle reminder of the stress that comes with their separation and the burden that Kevin carries. Itâ€™s hard being a dad.
