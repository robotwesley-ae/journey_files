write the following into FDX: The music is too loud, and the crowd is too loud. But he keeps dancing, inching closer to the microphone, hoping that Zion will see him on stage and know that his dad is still looking for him. As Kevin finally reaches the microphone, he loses his footing and falls off the stage, landing right on top of the little person with a loud "OOWF!" As Kevin lies sprawled on the ground, he realizes the little person beneath him is out cold. The surrounding crowd gasps, and someone quickly calls for an ambulance. People start pointing fingers at Kevin, accusing him of purposefully hurting her. "No, no! It was an accident!" Kevin pleads, trying to explain his fall off the stage. He scrambles to his feet, his face flushing with embarrassment and guilt. "I was just trying to reach the microphone to call out for my son, and I lost my footing." “That’s not your son that’s a grown woman!” Seeing the little person unconscious and not knowing when the paramedics would arrive, Kevin decides to attempt CPR. He kneels beside her and starts to perform chest compressions, his face a mix of concentration and concern. He leans in for mouth-to-mouth. People recording this all on their phones. It’s on all of the jumbotrons. The music has stopped, and Shenseea, looking concerned, steps away from the microphone to check on the little person. He tries to pick the little person up as people are shouting at him to help her “she’s much heavier than you think!” Just then, the pissed-off security guards who Kevin had sprayed with the fire extinguisher earlier spot him. Recognizing the opportunity to apprehend him, they start to push their way through the crowd, shouting for him to stay where he is. Kevin, seeing the approaching guards, knows he needs to make a quick escape. He catches Chad and Linda's eye, and they quickly hatch a plan. The two of them pull Kevin under the stage, where they begin to army crawl to avoid detection. Meanwhile, the paramedics arrive on scene, rushing through the crowd with a stretcher to tend to the injured little person. They carefully place her on the stretcher, checking her vitals before transporting her to the hospital.
