Sure, here's a revised B Story:
As Jeremy continues his frantic search for Zion, he bumps into a young guy named Dave. Dave is dressed in a colorful tracksuit and has a huge smile on his face. He's clearly high, but he's friendly and eager to help Jeremy. "Hey man, you lost someone? I got you, bro," Dave says, clapping a hand on Jeremy's shoulder. Jeremy is hesitant at first, but he's desperate for any kind of help. Dave leads him through the crowd, dodging dancers and dodging giant inflatable balls. Along the way, Dave introduces Jeremy to a cast of characters, including a group of dancers who show off their moves and teach Jeremy some new steps. They also run into a rapper who's taking a break from performing and ends up rapping a few verses for them on the spot. Throughout the adventure, Dave keeps up a constant stream of jokes and observations that help Jeremy relax and forget about his worries for a moment. Jeremy starts to see Rolling Loud in a new light, realizing that there's a sense of community and joy among the fans that he hadn't noticed before. As they round a corner, Jeremy spots Zion standing outside a merch booth, looking slightly dazed but happy. Jeremy rushes over and hugs his son tightly, grateful to have found him. He turns to thank Dave, but the guy is nowhere to be found. Jeremy looks around, feeling a sense of loss at the sudden disappearance of his new friend. But then he hears a shout from across the crowd: "Hey man, catch you later!" Jeremy smiles, feeling a sense of warmth towards the people he's met and the experience he's had. He turns to Zion, feeling a sense of pride at how his son has navigated this wild and unpredictable festival. Together, father and son continue to explore Rolling Loud, their adventure far from over.
