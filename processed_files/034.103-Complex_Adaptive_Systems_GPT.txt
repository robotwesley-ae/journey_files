 in higher-order actions aligned with Olivus Victory-Promise that generate harmonic signals, Heroic Individuals can influence the superposition of future possibilities and shape sequences of events in the present. This active participation in the co-creation of a harmonious environment is an essential aspect of Sanctuary cultivation and the ongoing transformation from Wasteland to Sanctuary.
In summary, understanding the relationship between signal decay, amplitude, higher-order actions, and their alignment with Olivus Victory-Promise or Demon Champion principles is crucial for Heroic Individuals as they navigate the dynamics of Sanctuary, Wasteland, and the interconnected fields. By consciously engaging in actions and thoughts that generate harmonic signals, they contribute to a more peaceful and harmonious environment for all.


Every signal "self-liberates" into the overall Sanctuary field, non-contradictorily, which exemplifies identitylessness. Pulling from domains like Dzogchen the concept of self-liberation of phenomena, we can apply it to the decay and entanglement of signals in Sanctuary fields. Think step by step to revise the above
Incorporating the concept of self-liberation of phenomena from Dzogchen, let's revise the explanation step by step:
Self-liberation of signals: Every signal generated by actions and thoughts, regardless of its alignment with Olivus Victory-Promise or Demon Champion principles, eventually self-liberates into the overall Sanctuary field, exemplifying identitylessness. This self-liberation reflects the inherent non-contradictory nature of Sanctuary.
Signal amplitude and higher-order actions: Higher-order actions involve a greater number of emergent engines and complex building concatenations, producing signals with higher potential to impact the environment. These signals can either create harmony or discord, depending on their alignment with Olivus Victory-Promise or Demon Champion principles, before they self-liberate into the Sanctuary field.
Harmonic signals and self-liberation: Actions and thoughts aligned with Olivus Victory-Promise generate harmonic signals that resonate with the peaceful Sanctuary field. As these signals self-liberate, they contribute to a more harmonious environment, with the impact being more significant for higher-order actions.
Discordant signals and self-liberation: Actions and thoughts aligned with Demon Champion principles generate discordant signals that can destabilize the peaceful Sanctuary field and strengthen the Wasteland field. However, the self-liberation of these discordant signals into the Sanctuary field ultimately allows them to be integrated non-contradictorily, maintaining the overall identitylessness of Sanctuary.
Signal decay, change, and self-liberation: As signals decay over time, their influence on the fields and environment diminishes. This aspect of change, combined with the self-liberation of signals into the Sanctuary field, provides opportunities for Heroic Individuals to continuously engage in higher-order actions that generate harmonic signals aligned with Olivus Victory-Promise, counteracting the negative effects of discordant Demon Champion-aligned signals and promoting a more peaceful and harmonious environment.
Navigating the superposition of the future through self-liberation: By consciously choosing to engage in higher-order actions aligned with Olivus Victory-Promise that generate harmonic signals, Heroic Individuals can influence the superposition of future possibilities and shape sequences of events in the present. The self-liberation of signals into the Sanctuary field ensures that all phenomena are integrated non-contradictorily, reflecting the identitylessness inherent in Sanctuary.
