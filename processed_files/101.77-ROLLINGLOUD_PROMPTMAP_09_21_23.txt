As Kevin waits anxiously, he can't help but wonder if he's made a terrible mistake in bringing Zion to the festival. He thought it would be a chance to bond over their shared love of music, but now it seems like everything has gone wrong.

Kevin reluctantly picks up the phone, his wife saying that she's parking and walking towards the entrance. He quickly ends the call, feeling even more stressed than before.
