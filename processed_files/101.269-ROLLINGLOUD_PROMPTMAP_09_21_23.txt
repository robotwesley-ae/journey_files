rewrite the following, but make Melanie challenge Kevin a little more. He told her he took Zion to see Avatar, not to the Rolling Loud music festival: INT. MELANIE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT Melanie, Kevin's wife, sits on the couch, her expression filled with concern. She dials Kevin's number on the phone, hoping for a reassuring conversation. CUT TO: EXT. FESTIVAL GROUNDS - DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT Kevin, Chad, Linda, and the two girls find themselves on the crowded dance floor, lost in the pulsating music and high-energy atmosphere. They move their bodies in a sensual grind. Chad tries to push Linda away from the group, but she persistently comes back. Kevin's phone BUZZES in his pocket. He reaches for it, hoping it's a call from Zion, but instead, it's his wife. He hesitates for a moment, contemplating whether to answer, then decides to take the call. KEVIN (trying to sound casual) Hey honey, how's it going? MELANIE (V.O.) Good, good. Is everything okay there? KEVIN Everything's great! MELANIE (V.O.) That's nice. What about Avatar? How's the movie? KEVIN (confused) Avatar? MELANIE (V.O.) Yes, Avatar. That's where you said you were going, remember? KEVIN Oh, right. Yeah, the movie. It's great! Really intense! MELANIE (V.O.) How's Zion doing? Kevin lies, attempting to sound casual and reassuring. KEVIN (with a smile) Great, honey. Having a blast! MELANIE (V.O.) That's wonderful. Tell me more about it. As his wife starts to probe for more details, Kevin's attention is divided. Chad and Linda make inappropriate comments in the background, and the two girls continue to flirt, making it harder for Kevin to concentrate on the call. CHAD (rude comment, interrupting) Hey Linda, I think they need you over at the cockblock section! LINDA (calling out to the girls) Chad’s missing his penis head! Kevin tries to maintain focus. KEVIN (to his wife) Sorry, honey, the movie is just so loud right now. We're really enjoying it. Zion loves it! He glances at Chad and Linda, signaling them to make noise, creating the illusion of being in a theater. KEVIN But I gotta go now, people are giving me dirty looks for talking on the phone in here. Love you, bye! Kevin quickly ends the call, relieved that he's avoided getting caught. The girls continue their flirtatious behavior, making inappropriate comments, but Kevin's attention is drawn to his phone as it comes to life with notifications from Zion's Snapchat account. He frantically opens the app, scrolling through the messages until he finds a picture of Zion jumping alongside a large crowd. KEVIN (relieved, muttering to himself) Zion! It’s Zion!!! Look! He shows the picture to Chad and Linda. LINDA (excitedly) I know which stage that is! I recognize that banner hanging from the stage. It's part of the volunteer setup!
