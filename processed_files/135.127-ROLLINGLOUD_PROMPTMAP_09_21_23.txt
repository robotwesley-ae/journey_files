They exchange a glance, then burst out laughing. KEVIN You guys... we must look insane! Linda, covered in silly string, shrugs with a grin. LINDA (normal, calm) Eh, I've looked worse. CHAD (teasing) Oh, yeah. Like the time you wore that lime green suit to prom? KEVIN I never wore-- wait...I did wear a green suit to prom. CHAD I know. I was there. KEVIN I looked good. CHAD You always look good. They all laugh harder. After a beat, Kevin's laughter fades. He takes a deep breath, an air of seriousness creeping in. KEVIN Hey... can I share something with you guys? Chad, still laughing, doesn't notice the shift. Linda, however, sobers quickly. LINDA (sincere) Hey, you can tell us anything, Kevin. Kevin swallows hard, glances at them, then looks back at the ground. KEVIN (sadly) My wife and I... we're taking a break. A trial separation. It's been four months, three weeks, and two days... And Zion... he doesn't know yet. He thinks I sleep on the couch because she keeps it freezing in the bedroom. I...I don't know how to tell him. CHAD That's rough. But you're an amazing dad. And Zion loves you. LINDA (supportive) Yeah. You'll figure it out. KEVIN I love her so much. I just feel like... I don’t know. I feel like I’m so stressed all the time. (struggling) Work is just...it's not good. Passed over for another promotion...starting to wonder if I'm even in the right field. CHAD (honest) Life's a storm, buddy. But remember, every storm passes. You just gotta stay afloat till then. LINDA And we're here to throw you a life jacket when you need it. Kevin nods, a melancholic smile on his face. His glance says it all, relief and gratitude mixed in. KEVIN (grateful) Thank you guys for helping me tonight. I know we’re gonna find him. I can feel it... CHAD (hesitant) I once lost everything on a blackjack table. Job, house, friends... Kevin's eyes widen in disbelief. LINDA Try investing all your savings into a pet grooming business. Spoiler: They all ran away. Chad raises an eyebrow, undeterred. CHAD Unidentified disease. Three doctors, zero answers. LINDA (deadpan) Had a boyfriend. Turned out to be a con artist. Left me with debts... and a chihuahua. CHAD Got blind for three days after an unfortunate run-in with a lemon. LINDA Get dehydrated after drinking a Diet Coke. Figure that one out.
