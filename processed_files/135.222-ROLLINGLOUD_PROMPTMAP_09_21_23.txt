Kevin stands, anxiously waiting for Zion to emerge. Ten long minutes pass, and worry starts to escalate. He scans the enormous, chaotic crowd, struggling to spot his son.
Desperation sets in. He pounds on the door of the portapotty he thought Zion went into, yelling out his name.
KEVIN Zion! Are you in there? It's me, Kevin!
A YOUNG GIRL emerges, giving him a confused look. Mortified, Kevin apologizes and quickly scurries away, but the pounding on the other portapotties continues as he and Chad frantically search for Zion.
People start giving Kevin strange looks, some questioning his decision to bring a 13-year-old to such a festival. But Kevin is too worried to care about their judgment.
CHAD Hey, Kevin! What's going on?
Kevin turns to Chad, his face filled with worry.
KEVIN I can't find Zion. He's been in one of these portapotties, but I don't know which one.
Chad's eyes widen, concern etched on his face.
CHAD Oh, man! That's not good. Let's find him. We'll check every damn portapotty if we have to!
Kevin nods, his panic increasing with every passing moment. They begin knocking on the doors of all the other portapotties, yelling out Zion's name at the top of their lungs.
KEVIN Zion! Where are you? Answer me!
But there's no response, and Kevin's panic only intensifies. He pulls out his phone, attempting to call Zion, but the spotty reception makes the call unsuccessful. His heart sinks as he realizes that technology won't help him find his son. He has no choice but to trust his instincts and rely on his own eyes to locate Zion.
Chad looks at Kevin, determination in his eyes.
CHAD We'll find him, Kevin. We'll keep searching until we do.
Kevin nods, grateful for Chad's support in this frantic search for his son. Together, they push through the crowd, scanning each portapotty for any sign of Zion, their voices becoming hoarse from yelling his name.
The crowd grows denser and more chaotic, making the search even more challenging. But Kevin and Chad refuse to give up hope, their determination unwavering.
KEVIN Zion! Please, where are you?
As they continue their search, Kevin can feel the weight of worry pressing down on him. Every passing moment without finding Zion feels like an eternity. The festival's relentless energy surrounds them, but their focus remains solely on finding Kevin's missing son.

It's awesome, although some people are getting herpes from it, so you have to be careful. Chad chuckles, seemingly oblivious to Kevin's mounting panic. Kevin continues his search, bumping into a group of high guys who stare blankly before wandering away. He approaches a group of selfie-taking girls, desperation evident in his voice. KEVIN Excuse me, have you seen a young boy named Zion? He's about 13 years old. The girls barely acknowledge him, too absorbed in their selfies. Kevin stuffs another bite of food into his mouth, mind racing with worst-case scenarios. CHAD Hey man, remember that documentary about lost children? Maybe we should start looking in trash cans and abandoned buildings. Turning to Chad, Kevin tries to remain polite but firm in his request. KEVIN Chad, I appreciate your help, but I really need to focus on finding Zion right now. Can you please give me some space? Chad, sensing Kevin's distress and urgency, reluctantly backs off, understanding the gravity of the situation. CHAD Yeah, sure, Kevin. I get it. Just let me know if you need anything, okay?
