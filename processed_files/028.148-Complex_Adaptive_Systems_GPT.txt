Yes we need to implement a SCALABLE system that accounts for knowledge discovery's data
To create a scalable system for knowledge discovery that can accommodate the growth of data, you can consider the following strategies:
Distributed storage and processing: Store the knowledge graph across multiple machines, servers, or clusters to distribute the load and facilitate parallel processing. This approach allows the system to scale horizontally by adding more machines as needed.
Efficient indexing and querying: Implement efficient indexing structures and query optimization techniques to enable fast retrieval of information from the knowledge graph. This may include using graph databases designed specifically for storing and querying connected data or employing graph partitioning methods to improve search performance.
Incremental learning and updating: Design the AI system to learn and update the knowledge graph incrementally, allowing it to incorporate new information without the need to reprocess the entire dataset. This approach can help reduce the computational resources required for updating the graph.
Hierarchical organization: Organize the knowledge graph into hierarchical structures or layers, where more abstract or general concepts are at higher levels, and specific details are at lower levels. This organization can help improve the efficiency of search and retrieval operations by focusing on relevant areas of the graph.
Caching and materialization: Use caching techniques to store frequently accessed or computationally expensive results, reducing the need for repeated processing. Materialization involves precomputing and storing the results of specific queries or operations for faster access.
Automated pruning and consolidation: Implement algorithms to automatically prune outdated or irrelevant information from the knowledge graph, as well as consolidate redundant or overlapping information. This can help maintain the graph's size and complexity at manageable levels.
By incorporating these strategies into the design of your AI system, you can create a scalable solution that effectively manages the growth of data and facilitates efficient knowledge discovery.


Well really there should be a knowledge graph visualization environment and then there should just be data. The data then needs to be compressed while preserving all the relationships when it is queried, using a decimal system (maybe - thoughts?) such that querying it wraps it in a context that maps the data onto a coordinate system so that the graph space is such that each subsequent coordinate set represents another version of X with a filterable difference (a nearest neighbor with x-1 or x+1, depending on direction, starting with the first numbers after the decimal and so on).
You've described an interesting approach to creating a knowledge graph visualization environment that dynamically compresses data and preserves relationships when queried. The key components of this system could include:
Data storage: Store the raw data in a distributed, scalable storage system. This could be a graph database, a document store, or another appropriate storage solution depending on your specific requirements.
Coordinate mapping: Design a coordinate mapping function that translates data into a coordinate system, preserving the relationships between data points. The use of a decimal system can provide an intuitive way to represent the relationships between different versions of data points (e.g., using decimal numbers to represent the degree of difference between related points).
Query processing: Implement a query processing engine that can take user queries, identify the relevant data, and apply the coordinate mapping function to generate the corresponding knowledge graph visualization. This engine should also support filtering based on specific attributes or differences between data points.
Visualization environment: Develop a user interface that allows users to interact with the knowledge graph visualization, explore the relationships between data points, and filter the view based on specific criteria.
