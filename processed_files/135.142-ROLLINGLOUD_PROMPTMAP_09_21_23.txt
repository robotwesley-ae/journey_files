INT. ROLLING LOUD FESTIVAL - CHAOTIC AREA - DAY
Kevin's mind is a jumbled mess as he tries to come up with a plan, but the effects of the drug are overpowering. The world around him morphs into a hallucinatory whirlwind of colors and shapes. Giant chickens parade by, talking trees share mysterious whispers, and unicorns prance, leaving trails of glitter in their wake.
KEVIN (trying to focus) I need to find Zion... I can't let this chaos stop me.
Suddenly, his wife's voice booms in his head, taking the form of a deep sea creature with tentacles that wrap around his thoughts.
MELANIE (via hallucination) Kevin, how did you get yourself into this mess? You have a responsibility as a father and a husband!
Kevin's mind struggles to comprehend her words as his thoughts quickly transform into something entirely different.
KEVIN (disoriented) Melanie, I... I need to find Zion. Focus, focus...
The swirling kaleidoscope of his hallucinations overwhelms him, leaving him disoriented and confused. He tries to regain his focus, but the ever-shifting imagery makes it impossible to concentrate.
CHAD (excitedly) I've got an idea! Watch this!
Chad grabs a glow stick and boldly places it in his butt, then takes off running, screaming maniacally.
LINDA (joining in) Woo! Playboi Carti, I love you!
Linda starts dancing wildly, matching Chad's energy.
KEVIN (amused) What are you two doing?
CHAD (grinning) Creating a distraction, my friend! We need to get their attention somehow.
Linda nods in agreement.
LINDA Maybe we can make a scene or something? Draw the security guards away?
Chad's eyes light up with mischief.
CHAD Exactly! We gotta get them chasing after us.
Kevin, though still disoriented, sees the logic in their plan.
KEVIN (focused) Alright, let's do it. We need time to search for Zion.
Chad and Linda continue their bizarre antics, drawing the attention of the security guards. In the midst of the chaos, Kevin seizes the opportunity and sneaks past them, making his way toward the artists-only area.
FEW MOMENTS LATER
Kevin, now inside the artists-only area, feels lost and alone amidst the pandemonium. He slinks off to the side, hoping for a stroke of luck.
SUDDENLY, a tap on his shoulder startles him. He turns around to see Shenseea, the Jamaican artist he had encountered earlier, wearing a mischievous grin.
KEVIN (startled) Shenseea? What are you doing here?
SHENSEEA (slyly) I couldn't help but notice your predicament. Need a little assistance, Kevin?
Kevin's face lights up with a mix of gratitude and hope.
KEVIN (relieved) More than you can imagine. I'm searching for my son, Zion. Can you help me find him?
Meanwhile, the security guards have finally decided to intervene, tackling Chad and Linda to the ground.
CHAD (yelling) Ow! My glow stick!
LINDA (embarrassed) Can we get a refund on those outfits?
Despite the consequences of their wild behavior, Kevin remains determined to find Zion, ready to face whatever challenges lie ahead with the unexpected help of Shenseea.
FADE OUT.
