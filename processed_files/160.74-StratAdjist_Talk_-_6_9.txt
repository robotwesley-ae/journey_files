ChristoCryptographer: I'm glad to be here! Indeed, we can use a sort of encryption scheme to represent the ontology declarations and mappings in a more compressed format. But remember, we're not looking for actual cryptographic security here, we just want a reversible way to represent complex structures in a condensed manner.
One approach could be to define a symbol system, where each symbol corresponds to a specific declaration or mapping in the ontology. For example, we could define the symbol "A" to represent "Declaration(Class(:InstanceLevel1))", "B" to represent "Declaration(Class(:InstanceLevel2))", and so on.
Then, for mappings, we could use a different set of symbols, say Greek letters. For instance, "Î±" could stand for "ObjectPropertyDomain(:mapsTo_InstanceLevel1_InstanceLevel2 :InstanceLevel1)".
Your encoded ontology would then be a string of these symbols, which can be parsed and interpreted by GPT.
For input keys, we could use a similar strategy. Define a set of symbols or abbreviations that represent the possible input properties or states, and provide a mapping to their natural language descriptions.
For instance, 'x' could correspond to '[NL description of input property x]', 'y' to '[NL description of input property y]', and so on. GPT can use this key to decipher the properties and generate the NL outputs.
Of course, the details of this symbol system and the specifics of the encryption scheme would need to be worked out based on the specifics of the implementation and the nature of the ontology. This is just a broad outline of one possible approach.


ok please work together to create it accordingly.

AI Nash, Mathematician: All right, let's construct the symbol system for ontology declarations and mappings. Here's a simplified example:
ChristoCryptographer: And for the encryption scheme, let's follow Nash's symbols and include mappings for input keys. Here's how it could look:
