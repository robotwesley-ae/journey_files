rewrite the following scene, keeping all of the content the same, but expand on the performance and the need for Kevin to twerk good enough to attract the attention of Eviana: EXT. ROLLING LOUD VENUE - NIGHT Using Linda's volunteer credentials to navigate the festival grounds, KEVIN, CHAD, and LINDA encounter numerous boys passing by. Linda's enthusiasm heightens with each sighting. LINDA (excited) Is that him? KEVIN (frustrated) No. LINDA (anxiously) Is that him? KEVIN (patience wearing thin) No, Linda. That's not him. That's just another festival-goer. EXT. FESTIVAL STAGE - ROLLING LOUD VENUE - NIGHT SHENSEEA performs "Be Good" on stage, captivating the crowd with her energy. She calls out to members to show off their twerking skills, hyping up the audience. SHENSEEA (to the crowd) Alright, who's the best twerker out here? Show me what you got! The crowd goes wild, eager to impress SHENSEEA. She brings a LITTLE PERSON onto the stage, igniting even more excitement from the audience. SHENSEEA Alright, girlfriend. What's your name? EVIANA My name's Eviana. SHENSEEA Beautiful name, Eviana. Show us what you got... Shenseea continues her performance while Eviana starts twerking. The crowd is ecstatic. BACK TO: EXT. ROLLING LOUD VENUE - NIGHT LINDA (excited) Is that him? KEVIN (frustrated) No, Linda. That's not him. That's just another festival-goer. CHAD (teasingly) You think everyone is Zion. LINDA (defensively) They all kinda' look alike. KEVIN and CHAD exchange glances -- uh oh. LINDA (realizing her mistake) Teenagers. Not black people! Gosh. She points towards another person in the crowd. LINDA (pointing) Is that him? KEVIN (squinting) Linda, that's a girl in a unicorn onesie. Definitely not Zion. CHAD (to Linda) You're such a loser. LINDA (defensive) I'm trying my best, okay? The energy in the air is electric. INTERCUT WITH: EXT. FESTIVAL STAGE - ROLLING LOUD VENUE - NIGHT SHENSEEA (pointing to the crowd) Alright, my friend here wants someone to join us on stage and dance! Pick someone, my friend! IN THE CROWD Kevin has an idea. He turns to Chad and Linda, his eyes filled with determination. KEVIN (inspired) Wait... If I can get on stage, Zion can see me. CHAD (excited) That's a great idea. Let's do it. The trio pushes through the dense crowd, facing the challenge of reaching the front. CHAD (determined) This crowd is like a solid wall! Kevin, Chad, and Linda's banter adds to the chaos and slows their progress. Linda confidently flashes her volunteer badge, allowing them to maneuver through checkpoints and restricted areas with relative ease. KEVIN (desperate) We're almost there! Finally, after what feels like an eternity, they reach the front where bouncers work tirelessly to control the crowd. ON STAGE Eviana spots Kevin dancing like a crazy person. LITTLE PERSON (excitedly) Hey, you! Get up here! Bouncers initially try to hold Kevin back, unsure about letting him on stage. But seeing that Eviana has chosen him, they reluctantly assist Kevin, guiding him through the crowd. KEVIN (out of breath) I... made it! The crowd cheers, unaware of the chaos unfolding in Kevin's personal life.
