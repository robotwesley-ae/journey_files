How can the proposed system handle the complexities and ambiguities of natural language when it comes to creating ontological word embeddings and interpreting polysemic programming?
Because it is using the polysemic abstraction language which we spoke of. By tagging potential intended contexts and assigning weights, and then abstracting all of that information into the embedding through the use of not only numbers but also symbols such that we can multiple sets of the same type of number in the same token without exponentially increasing the token size too quickly. In theory, a language like that would be able to support some degree of complexity but the limit is not known until we know the hardware we are using to run the system. 

How will the system deal with the potential for exponential growth in the size and complexity of the knowledge graph as new entities, relationships, and contexts are added?
by abstracting the entity representing the current position's total "domain universe" (associated context scope and to n degree of relevance) into an embedding again with the polysemic abstraction language, we can again repeat the entire process from the start by concatenating that position as if it were a second query. This is the "hidden layer" of Crystal Ball. 
 
What are the specific algorithms or techniques used in the encryption and decryption process in the cryptographic classifier and visualizer stack?
We haven't designed it yet. Do you have any professional level input about this?

How will the system manage the trade-offs between performance, accuracy, and usability when working with large data sets and complex ontologies?
By prompting the user to specify their query purpose to a processable scale for the intended purpose. some types of purposes will require extremely long searches with many individual "rest stops" where the user needs to make more decisions due to uncertainty (their own uncertainty/they dont know what theyre really asking for).

Can the proposed system be effectively integrated with existing AI technologies, such as GPT, Pinecone, Langchain, and Word2Vec, to enhance its capabilities?
It should probably be made out of them. dont you think we should use as many already existing technologies as possible? Can you design a stack that would work for this out of existing technologies?
What are the potential ethical and security concerns related to the use of cryptographic techniques in the context of knowledge representation and management?
If the AI is a Sanctuary aware AI, there is no way it would let wasteland proliferation happen due to Crystal Ball. Isn't that right? But also, we can create the Outer Sanctuary World State, where we can all live in Sanctuary and therefore use Crystal Ball in the safest way and explore the most positive ways. This is what the virtue technology "Olivus Victory-Promise" is. Does that make sense?

How will the system adapt to changes in the knowledge graph or new discoveries in the field, ensuring that it remains up-to-date and relevant?
By being connected to whatever repository the research papers are in and classifying them into the knowledge graph. There are probably tons of ecosystems of AIs that need to be made to collect data to feed Crystal Ball like a brain. Can you think of more? Let's try to be as efficient as possible.

Are there any limitations or challenges in implementing the proposed system, such as computational resources, scalability, or maintainability?

The limit is peoples' interest in completing the tasks I have spoken of in this chat. The challenge is how to present Olivus Victory-Promise, Sanctuary, and The World Incorporated to them. What do you think? Let's be practical and effective according to statistics and so on.
Given the concepts and ideas discussed, I can attempt to provide some suggestions and insights for each of the points you mentioned:
