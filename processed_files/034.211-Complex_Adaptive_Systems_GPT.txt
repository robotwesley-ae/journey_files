Select the platform that best suits your requirements and desired features

but you forgot to specify the level of granularity below requirements and desired features - you can list those and shouldve. can you revise the output to make sure its correct?
Apologies for the oversight. Here's the revised version of Stage 1 with more granularity regarding requirements and desired features:
Stage 1: Choose a no-code platform for building the trading bot application.
Research and compare no-code platforms (Bubble, Adalo, Glide)
Evaluate their ease of use, compatibility with Zapier, and support for API integration
Identify the specific requirements and desired features for the trading bot application
Real-time financial data retrieval
Algorithmic trading functionality
Integration with GPT-4 for decision-making and natural language understanding
Customizable user interface and dashboard
Risk management features
User authentication and account management
Deployment and hosting options
Scalability and flexibility for future updates and improvements
Select the platform that best suits your requirements and desired features, taking into consideration the identified requirements and desired features.


do the same for each stage
Here's the revised version of each stage with more granularity:
Stage 2: Integrate Zapier plugins and external APIs for data retrieval and trading functionality.
Identify the required Zapier plugins and external APIs for data retrieval, trading, and GPT-4 integration
Financial data API (e.g., Alpha Vantage, Quandl, FRED)
Trading platform API (e.g., Alpaca, Interactive Brokers, Robinhood)
GPT-4 API for natural language understanding and decision-making
Set up the API connections within your chosen no-code platform
Configure API keys and authentication
Test API connections and functionality
Implement real-time data retrieval and trading functionality using the integrated APIs
Design the user interface for data visualization and interaction
Create workflows and triggers for automated trading using Zapier plugins and no-code logic
Stage 3: Develop the continuous surf trading algorithm and integrate it with GPT-4.
Research and define the mathematical formula and trading rules for the continuous surf strategy
Include factors like trading fees, rate of change, and risk management
Incorporate trading indicators and signals (e.g., moving averages, RSI, MACD)
Implement the continuous surf trading algorithm within your no-code platform
Use no-code logic and data from the integrated APIs
Optimize the algorithm for different market conditions and asset classes
Integrate GPT-4 for decision-making and natural language understanding within the trading bot
Use GPT-4 API to process market data, news, and user inputs
Enhance the trading algorithm with GPT-4's insights and predictions
Stage 4: Design a user interface and dashboard for the trading bot application.
Sketch and plan the layout and design of the user interface and dashboard
Consider the user experience and ease of use
Include elements like data visualizations, trading controls, and user account management
Implement the user interface and dashboard within your chosen no-code platform
Use no-code design tools and components
Ensure compatibility with different devices and screen sizes
Test the user interface and dashboard for usability and functionality
Gather feedback from potential users and iterate on the design as needed
Stage 5: Deploy, test, and launch the trading bot application.
Set up the hosting and deployment options for your trading bot application within the chosen no-code platform
Configure domain settings, SSL certificates, and server infrastructure
Deploy the trading bot application and conduct thorough testing
Test the application's functionality, performance, and security
Identify and fix any issues or bugs
Launch the trading bot application and promote it to your target audience
Use marketing and promotional strategies to attract users
Collect user feedback and monitor the application's performance and success
Stage 6: Iterate and improve the trading bot application based on user feedback and market trends.
