This example demonstrates how multiple funnels can be composed to guide a customer through a complex journey. The customer progresses through the meta funnel stages in order, but the stages can repeat and the customer can loop back or skip ahead as needed. The sequence of funnels is tailored to the customer's behavior and the company's goals, and each funnel feeds into the next in a logical and effective way.

Here's how a customer might progress through these funnels:

**Step 1: Social Media Funnel (Awareness → Interest → Engagement → Action → Conversion)**

The customer first encounters the company through a post on Instagram (Social Post Creation - Awareness). They find the post interesting and follow the company's Instagram page (Social Post Interaction - Interest). They regularly engage with the company's posts (Engagement). One day, they see a post promoting a blog post on the company's website and decide to click on it (Website Click - Action). They read the blog post and sign up for the company's newsletter (Squeeze Page Conversion - Conversion).

**Step 2: Content Funnel (Awareness → Interest → Engagement → Action → Conversion)**

After signing up for the newsletter, the customer receives regular blog posts from the company (Content Creation - Awareness). They find the topics interesting and regularly read the posts (Content Consumption - Engagement). They like and share the posts on their social media (Content Interaction - Action). They see an offer for a free ebook on a related topic and decide to download it (Lead Generation - Conversion).

**Step 3: Email Funnel (Awareness → Interest → Engagement → Action → Conversion)**

After downloading the ebook, the customer receives a series of emails from the company (Email Creation - Awareness). They open and read the emails (Email Open - Interest, Email Read - Engagement). One of the emails contains an offer for a discounted product (Click on CTA - Action). They consider buying the product but ultimately decide not to (Conversion).

**Step 4: Ad Funnel and Retargeting Funnel (Awareness → Interest → Engagement → Action → Conversion)**

Since the customer showed interest in the product but didn't purchase it, they are entered into a retargeting funnel. They start seeing ads for the product on various websites (Ad Creation - Awareness, Ad Placement - Interest). They click on one of the ads and are taken to the product page (Ad Click - Engagement). They still decide not to purchase the product (Landing Page Interaction - Conversion).

**Step 5: Webinar Funnel (Awareness → Interest → Engagement → Action → Conversion)**

The company decides to host a webinar to provide more information about the product. The customer receives an email about the webinar and decides to register (Webinar Registration - Engagement). They attend the webinar and learn more about the product (Webinar Attendance - Action). After the webinar, they receive a follow-up email with a special offer for the product (Follow-up Email - Conversion).

**Step 6: Call Booking Funnel (Awareness → Interest → Engagement → Action → Conversion)**

The customer decides to book a consultation call to learn more about the product (Call Request Submission - Interest). They receive a confirmation email and attend the call (Call Confirmation - Engagement, Call Participation - Action). During the call, they decide to purchase the product (Follow-up - Conversion).

**Step 7: Direct Sales Funnel (Awareness → Interest → Engagement → Action → Conversion → Ascension)**
