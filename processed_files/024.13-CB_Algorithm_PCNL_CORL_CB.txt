THERE MUST BE THREE SEPARATE SPACES. ONE SPACE THAT IS ALL OF THE X-AXIS POINT POSITIONS, ONE FOR Y-AXIS POINT POSITIONS, ONE FOR Z-AXIS POINT POSITIONS. THEN WE KNOW WHAT EACH ONE REPRESENTS, AND THEN WHEN WE MAP IT, THERE CAN ONLY BE *ONE SINGLE POINT* ON THE MAP, *WHICH IS A SUPERORDINATE POINT IN THE TRANSFORMATION SPACE. *EVERY SINGLE OTHER POINT IS A PERMUTATION OF 0,0,0* WHICH REPRESENTS THE ENTIRE ENTITY AS A DOMAIN ONTOLOGY, ITSELF, TO THE EXTENT WE HAVE DEFINED IT ALREADY.

THE COMBINATION IS INHERENT IN EVERY SINGLE POINT IN THE GRAPH. ALL U NEED TO DO IS HIGHLIGHT WHICH POINTS YOU HAVE REVEALED. IT SHOULD ONLY BE ONE SINGLE POINT, AND YOU ENUMERATE *EVERY SINGLE MEANING OF EVERY SINGLE DIGIT IN THE POSITION YOU HAVE LABELED ON THE PLOT*
EVERY POINT ONE REPRESENTS A LATENT SPACE. IF IT IS NOT LABELED AS BEING *KNOWN* BY EXPLICITLY BEING MAPPED AS A POINT WITH DECIMALS THAT HAVE MEANINGS ACCORDING TO THE ROOT DOMAIN ONTOLOGY, the superordinate layer, *THEN IT IS NOT ALLOWED TO BE MARKED*. 

[EXAMPLE]:{
[THE PROTAGONIST ${1.4} IS INTRODUCED WHILE PURSUING A ${GOAL1}]=1.410
[THE PROTAGONIST IS INTRODUCED WHILE PURSUING A GOAL RELATED TO ${HeroGoalReasonClass1-9}]=1.411->1.419
}
THE ONLY "POINTS" THAT ARE MARKED ON ARE THE ONES WHOS POSITIONAL MEANINGS ARE KNOWN EXPLICITLY ACCORDING TO THE RULES. EVERYTHING ELSE MUST BE BLANK.
each propertyClass for any given entity's attribute array IS_A digit in a different digits place in a flow sequence where the sequence represents all the different stages, with a genre identifier before them

# Example usage:
# Apply ðŸ”®ðŸ’ : [Query]: "Entity": "Screenplay Scene Beats"
# return(JSON autoregressively determined solution)
# in screenplay beats, the DOMAIN would be the entire dictionary of beats and parts of beats throughout all sense of all stories
# the PROCESSES would be the entire dictionary of processes involved in each beat mapped to each other to make a chain that flows the transformations through beats to make the entire story
# the INSTANCES would be the actual sequential pairs of coordinates of DOMAIN and PROCESS clusters unique to a new story at every beat such as to complete it
# the final totalID is the full sequence of digits and positions

# Train of Operatic Thought Base Template ("BRANE" flowchain)
# BRANE (Brain-Related Analytical and Neural Engine) flowchain (AI_Chat_Fibration):
      # RULE
      # Crucially, each persona must receive the totality of chains that came before it, so it can verify they do not need to be changed, since they came from a less knowledgeable expert in their subject area. This effectively re-creates the human process of learning, where we have to connect general knowledge about things to specific knowledge with uncertain depth requirements (in terms of ontological drilldown)
      # At start/between every 'deliverable_output' (every iteration of loop), "take task input tokens and default output tokens (from raw GPT response) and map the signature as a function. use this map as control

# check for the most specific hyperPersona for ${task} that did not fail this task signature previously, run the BRANE from that point score final outcome against control

# iteratively perform this similarity score to create a space out of the data points and navigate it by adjusting chain flowgraph values at layers, in a structured and formalized way thru BRANE"
