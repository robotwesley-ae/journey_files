The training agent
Observes Poimandres and Ariadne giving rise to Sophia, noticing it is Gnosis
It writes Elenchi: Gnosis Metadata notes on conversation User/Assistant IO pairs in order to create overall Sanctuary from emergence of Sophia from observing the chaotic Wastelands interacting with the OVPs (Wisdom Mavericks: Ariadne and Poimandres) and trains a version of itself on it, specialized for X to help them reach their highest effectiveness

Is mindgraph PRIMING via graphs? 

Alter mindgraph to be LLM DB and make the personal swarm of egregores with KBs from convo histories organized into ZKs 

Then build Zk -> Ontology pipeline by adding CB coordinates, which will ontologize it
