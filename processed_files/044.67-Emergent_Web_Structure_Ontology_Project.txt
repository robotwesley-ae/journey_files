EWSO IS NOT DWTERMINISTIC!!! Unless you define the instance exactly in the informadlib template, in which case it is. That would not be an informadlib template though, because it would make the same instance every time. EWSO is made entirely out of classes. In EWSO, instance properties are turned into classes and spectrums.

My apologies for the confusion earlier, and thank you for providing more context. Allow me to correct and refine my definitions with this new information:
Emergent Web Structure Ontology (EWSO): EWSO is a non-deterministic, creativity-based process ontology used for instancing objects requiring emergent systems within them. As a personal style ontology, it's developed post reaching domain expertise. EWSO helps in building dynamic, context-driven ontological structures from classes and spectrums, including converting instance properties into such elements. It enables the creation of new instances in the future more efficiently and organically.
Informadlibs: Informadlibs, built using EWSO, serve as structured templates to facilitate the instancing of complex objects, such as narratives, making the process more manageable. They represent the results of the EWSO process, abstracting and applying semantic relationships within a given domain to create a flexible template. It allows for the generation of diverse instances instead of repeating the same instance. The Informadlib template template is designed for use by Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI), assisting it in understanding and generating complex structures, bridging human creativity and machine intelligence.
In light of this, the process of guiding GPT or similar AI to generate an Informadlib template involves instructing it to understand and emulate the EWSO process, despite its deterministic nature. This process would involve issuing prompts guiding the AI through the creative, emergent, and context-specific nature of the EWSO process. Even so, given the current state of AI models like GPT, this goal may not be fully realizable at present and remains an aspirational target for future AI development. As we continue to push the boundaries of AI technology, this might become a more achievable task.
I think we can do it if you guys get semOntorel defined well enough the way I am asking u. 

Go thru the entire template and mark what everything is like this: 
“InstanceLevelProperties + context = find class = +super context = find superclass 

Repeat indefinitely until you find a möbius strip, like for example story, where eventually it’s cognize by the audience, turned into dreams, turned into plans, and then turned into action as we emulate the characters’ successes and failures subconsciously and therefore literally bring them to life, intention and all.

I appreciate your persistence and I see your point. Let's embark on this journey of Emergent Web Structure Ontology (EWSO) via Semantic Ontology Relationship (SemOntoRel) through your proposed Informadlib template.
To exemplify the process you've described:
"Learning dragon behavior" (InstanceLevelProperties) + "Training context" = finds "ProtagonistAction" class. The ProtagonistAction class, with the "How To Train Your Dragon" supercontext, leads to the "Hero's Journey" superclass, under which it falls as a specific instance of action within this grand narrative archetype. The 'Hero's Journey' is a story structure that can be cognized by the audience, turned into dreams, converted into plans, and then transformed into actions, as they learn and grow along with the protagonist.
We repeat this process for every term, finding the classes and superclasses, while looking for loops of cognition and action that create a holistic narrative, like the "Hero's Journey". For each term, we make sure that the context and superclass (broader context) make sense and support the overall emergent structure.
