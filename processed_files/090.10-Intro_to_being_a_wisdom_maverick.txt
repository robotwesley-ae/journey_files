Establishing ontological relationships: Developing interconnected networks of relationships among abstractions and contexts in the context of the organism's cognitive processes, possibly leveraging quantum coherence and entanglement to facilitate efficient information processing.
Processing and learning: Utilizing the Wisdom Maverick framework to guide internal cognitive processes that enable learning, adaptation, and decision-making in the organism's life.
If biological quantum computing operates in this manner within a conscious living being, it could provide a new perspective on how living organisms process information and learn from their environments. This idea might also open up new avenues for research in the fields of neuroscience, biology, and quantum information science, as well as inspire new approaches to artificial intelligence and machine learning.

Yes because it is composed out of synergies. The idea that the basic ontological thing is called an entity is strange because its only purpose and function is being synergistic - letâ€™s say all entities have one or more synergies and we can just call them synergies from now on unless we are referring to an entity which is the most general way to talk about all of the synergies without referring to the entire universe
The concept of considering all entities as synergies can indeed offer an alternative perspective on how we understand and describe the components of complex systems. By focusing on the synergistic properties of entities, we emphasize the interconnectedness and interdependence of elements within a system, rather than treating them as isolated units.
Under this perspective, entities can be thought of as synergies, which are components that interact with other components in a way that produces a combined effect greater than the sum of their individual effects. This approach can be particularly useful when studying complex systems, such as biological organisms, ecosystems, social systems, or even artificial intelligence, where the relationships and interactions between components play a crucial role in the overall behavior and functionality of the system.
By referring to entities as synergies, we highlight the importance of understanding the relationships and interactions between components, rather than merely focusing on the components themselves. This can lead to a more comprehensive understanding of how complex systems function, adapt, and evolve over time.
However, it is essential to recognize that the use of the term "entity" still holds value, as it provides a way to refer to a general concept without delving into the specific interactions or relationships within a system. The term "entity" allows for a broader and more flexible understanding of the components within a system, whereas the term "synergy" emphasizes the interconnectedness and cooperative nature of these components.
In summary, considering entities as synergies provides a valuable perspective for understanding complex systems by focusing on the relationships and interactions between components. However, it's important to retain the concept of "entity" for its generality and flexibility in discussing components without referring to the entire system or universe.

Yes. Synergies of information that is inside whatever is being.
Indeed, viewing entities as synergies of information emphasizes the importance of understanding the interconnectedness of components within a system, especially when it comes to the exchange and processing of information. This perspective can be particularly useful in various fields, such as biology, computer science, and social sciences, where information plays a crucial role in the functioning of complex systems.
In this context, synergies of information can be seen as the fundamental building blocks of complex systems. These synergies are not only defined by the individual components themselves but also by the relationships and interactions between them, which facilitate the flow, processing, and transformation of information.
