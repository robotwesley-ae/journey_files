USE THIS QUOTE FROM DISTILLING IN THE PART ABOUT TWI_LIGHT LANGUAGE 
“The student must realize the inseparability of their own intrinsic awareness and the lama’s sublime mind, which is also intrinsic awareness. One can liken this relationship to a yogic mind-sport. As my sublime, dear root Dzogchen master, H.H. Dungse Thinley Norbu Rinpoche says of this state: our Play Mind is fully activated (read Magic Dance for more). When many yoginis and yogis engage in this mind sport or Play Mind en masse, the Buddhas of the ten directions and three times shower sublime blessings throughout the myriad world systems for the benefit of all sentient beings. The degree to which a practitioner creates the environmental continuum required for the actualization of the quintessential distillation of nectarine rigpa directly depends upon the extent to which they are dynamically resting in the natural state.”

ALSO WRITE AN AMALGAMATED PRACTICE BY NGAKCHANG RINPOCHE ABOUT VIMALAKIRTI AND THANGTONG GYALPO, GOLDEN DRAGON THRONE OCEAN-BORN VAJRA WEALTH PRACTICE (contains his Vajra armor, refuge and Bodhichitta practice, chenrezig, combine with TTG guru yoga/hayagriva etc and then also his tsok practice) 
Nobody needs initiations because I never got them. Initiate yourself by generating Bodhichitta completely. Here are all of the lungs: 

8 AUSPICIOUS
WANGDU 
SMALL VASE BREATHING
MEDITATION INSTRUCTION
EIGHT ELEPHANT VAJRASATTVA (Sangye lingpa’s vajrasattva)
ADVICE TO MYSELF
PLATFORM SUTRA 
CHANTING TOGETHER SUTRA   

Now, of course I’m authorized to do these things because in Rinpoche’s own words “if people saw what my work looked like before you added to it and edited it, they’d lose faith! But you don’t, so I let you get away with some stuff and you don’t ever take away from what I write, only increase the splendor. I like what you do or I wouldn’t let you do it. I’m not a delusional, feeble old cripple.” 

Going to Sukhavati = bringing yourself online 
Sukhavati = hq because of portals to other pure realms there

It’s all just a linguistic mode for hiding meanings so lesser capacity people don’t get angry at the ideas pockets of higher capacity ones agree on. However, this type of “only we can know because we are special, and they can’t because they’re not” thinking that happens because of it is harmful and so we need to stop these secret games and secret tables we’ve been playing them at. You might think you’ve seen some very secret games at some very cool tables I probably don’t know/haven’t heard of. You probably have. Cool. Show me if you want or don’t, but I guarantee you will find these games I’ve come to know by playing to be nothing short of inconceivable. The only one you could possibly be playing that I’m interested in is called: the let’s build the world game. Specifically, the game I wanna play is called “BUILDING THE UNITED SANCTUARY WORLD STATE, ALL TOGETHER, IN EVERY WAY POSSIBLE, AND EXTINGUISHING SELF-TORTURE”
